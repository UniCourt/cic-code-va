     <p>
      At its 1970 session the General Assembly, by Acts 1970, c. 606, repealed Title 42 and enacted in its place a new Title 42.1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1970, c. 606, cls. 5-8 provide:
     </p>
     <p>
      "5. The repeal of Title 42 shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued or accruing on or before the effective date of its repeal [June 26, 1970], or any prosecution, suit or action pending on that date. Except as in this act otherwise provided, neither the repeal of Title 42 of the Code of Virginia nor the enactment of Title 42.1 shall apply to offenses committed prior to the effective date thereof, and prosecutions for such offenses shall be governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose. For the purposes of this act, an offense was committed prior to such date if any of the essential elements of the offense occurred prior thereto.

      "6. Whenever in Title 42.1 any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 42, as such title existed prior to the effective date of this act, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article or chapter of Title 42.1, and whenever any such former section, article or chapter of Title 42 is given a new number in Title 42.1 or in Title 10 (now Title 10.1), all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 42 appearing elsewhere in the Code of Virginia than in Title 42.1 shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions or contents or portions thereof.

      "7. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set out herein, and if any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this act shall ever be declared unconstitutional, it shall be deemed severable, and the remainder of this act shall continue in full force and effect.

       Qualifications of librarians.

      - The term "librarian" historically appears to be a term of art referring to what now is understood to be the "library director" or "library administrator." See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04).

      require that librarians in local or regional libraries, in the position of director, and other persons holding full-time professional positions deemed by the local or regional library to require American Library Association-equivalent training, shall meet the qualification standards established by the Library Board. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04).
     </p>
     <p>
      No Virginia statute requires the Library Board to offer a dual-track certification if the Board deems an American Library Association-based certification to be sufficient; if the Board elects to implement a certification process that is not approved by the Association, however, legislation or regulations may be necessary to authorize the Board to provide standards and guidance for such alternative credentialing, including express authorization to "grandfather" librarians who obtained their Library of Virginia "certification for life" prior to repeal of the State Board for the Certification of Librarians. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69
      (11/4/04).
     </p>
     <p>
      The intent of the librarian certification statute is to encourage that all public libraries have at least one credentialed director/librarian available to that library system, as well as an American Library Association-credentialed librarian, or a similarly credentialed professional, for positions deemed by the local bodies to require such specialized training; it is incumbent on each local or regional library board to determine whether any particular position constitutes a "full-time professional librarian position" as described in this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69
      (11/4/04).
     </p>
     <p>
      The Library Board is not authorized to "grandfather" librarians serving before 1988, who do not meet current qualifications. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04).

Thereafter, all members shall be appointed for terms of four years. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms as soon as possible in the manner in which members of the board are regularly chosen.

     <p>
      The members of the board of a regional library system shall be appointed by the respective governing bodies represented. If the board of the regional library system is composed of two or more members from each county, city and town that is a part thereof, then each governing body represented on the board may appoint a member or an employee of the governing body to the board. Such members shall in the beginning draw lots for expiration of terms, to provide for staggered terms of office, and thereafter the appointment shall be for a term of four years. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms as soon as possible in the manner in which members are regularly chosen. No appointive member shall be eligible to serve more than two successive terms. A member shall not receive a salary or other compensation for services as member, but necessary expenses actually incurred shall be paid from the library fund. A regional board member may be removed for misconduct or neglect of duty by the governing body making the appointment. The board members shall elect officers and adopt such bylaws, rules and regulations for their own guidance and for the government of the regional free library system as may be expedient. They shall have control of the expenditure of all moneys credited to the regional free library fund. The regional board shall have the right to accept donations and bequests of money, personal property, or real estate for the establishment and maintenance of such regional free library system or endowments for same.

     </p>
     <p>
      The imposition of such assessment shall be by ordinance of the governing body, which ordinance may provide for different sums in circuit courts and district courts, and the assessment shall be collected by the clerk of the court in which the action is filed, and remitted to the treasurer of such county, city or town and held by such treasurer subject to disbursements by the governing body for the acquisition of (i) law books, law periodicals and computer legal research services, computer terminals for offsite placement to maximize access to the law library by the public, and (ii) equipment for the establishment, use and maintenance of a law library which shall be open for the use of the public at hours convenient to the public. In addition to the acquisition of law books, law periodicals and computer legal research services and equipment, the disbursements may include compensation to be paid to librarians and other necessary staff for the maintenance of such library and acquisition of suitable quarters for such library. The compensation of such librarians and the necessary staff and the cost of suitable quarters for such library shall be fixed by the governing body and paid out of the fund created by the imposition of such assessment of cost. Such libraries, pursuant to rules of the Supreme Court and at costs to such libraries, may have access to computer research services of the State Law Library. Disbursements may be made to purchase or lease computer terminals for the purpose of retaining such research services. The assessment provided for herein shall be in addition to all other costs prescribed by law, but shall not apply to any action in which the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof or the federal government is a party and in which the costs are assessed against the Commonwealth, political subdivision thereof, or federal government. The governing body is authorized to accept contributions to the fund from any bar association.

       Policy and Purpose
      </p>
      
      <p>
       Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

        Community service attendance sheet is public record.
       </b>
       - Sufficient evidence supported defendant's convictions of forgery and uttering a public record, as the evidence in defendant's case showed that defendant added hours to a community service attendance sheet to show that defendant had performed all of defendant's court-ordered community service when in fact defendant had not done so; the attendance sheet qualified as a required public record to support defendant's conviction because the evidence showed that it was a document the probation officer collected pursuant to the duties that the county imposed upon her in supervising individuals on probation and the evidence also showed that defendant had added hours to it that defendant had not worked despite the fact that the sheet said not to write on it and that doing so would amount to forgery, a felony.
