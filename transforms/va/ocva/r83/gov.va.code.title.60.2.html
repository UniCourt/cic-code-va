       Editor's note.
      </b>
      - House Joint Resolution No. 195 of the 1985 Acts of Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to make a study of former Title 60.1 and report to the Governor and the General Assembly its findings in the form of a revision of that title. In January, 1986, its report, containing a proposed revision of former Title 60.1, was sent to the Governor and the General Assembly. The report was published as House Document No. 11 of the 1986 Session and served as the basis for Title 60.2, which was enacted by Acts 1986, c. 480, effective January 1, 1987.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to its revision by Acts 1986, c. 480, former Title 60.1 was amended by certain other acts during the 1986 Session. These amendments have been incorporated, as appropriate, into comparable provisions of Title 60.2, pursuant to
      <span class="s1">
       §
      </span>
      30-152.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 60.1 or prior law.

        Misconduct not proven.
       </b>
       - Employee's use of vulgar language was not of such a nature as to manifest a willful disregard of employer business interests or employee's duties and obligations to his employer. Employee's remarks, while vulgar and offensive, were not a lengthy barrage. They were a part of an isolated outburst following a private two and one-half hour meeting of management officials. The chief executive officer initiated the discussion of union organization at employer's place of business, and repeatedly demanded employee's resignation. Employee had been an employee of employer for almost 20 years. There was no evidence that he had a record of misconduct. There was no evidence that employee's remarks were overheard by store employees or customers. Misconduct had not been proven. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va.

None of the corporations had a sufficient number of employees but all were liable under subdivision B 3 of this section, because of common ownership.

         Determination of relationship from actual practice supplementing contract between parties.

        - In attempting to solve the question whether one was performing services for another and was in the latter's employment under the Unemployment Compensation Act, the courts are not so much concerned with what a contract between the parties says as they are with actual practice of the parties which supplemented their written agreement.

        As at common law, and in the worker's compensation context, the existence of the master-servant relationship under the act does not depend upon how the parties designate each other in their contract. Rather, the individual's status in relation to the alleged employer is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances adduced by the evidence, including the provisions of any written agreement.

         Power of control determines relationship.
        </b>
        - Where the party for whom the work is to be done has the power to direct the means and methods by which the other does the work, an employer-employee relationship exists; if the latter is free to adopt such means and methods as he chooses to accomplish the result, he is not an employee but an independent contractor. Among the tests used to determine if the right to control exists are: whether instructions have to be obeyed, and whether either of the parties possesses the right to terminate services at will without incurring liability to the other. VEC v. A.I.M. Corp.,
        <cite class="va_code">

       <p>
        In any master-servant analysis, be it in the area of tort liability, worker's compensation, or unemployment compensation, the power of control is the determining factor in ascertaining the parties' status. The potential power of control, not the actual exercise of control, is the important element. And the right of control does not include only the power to specify the result to be accomplished, but, in the language of the act, it must include the power over the performance of such services, both under the contract of service and in fact.

        Drywall contractor failed to prove that drywall installers were free from its control or direction where evidence in the record was sufficient to show that contractor had the potential right to discharge installers for disobedience with the company's standards while work was in progress; therefore the service performed by installers was within the Act's definition of employment and contractor was required to pay taxes on the remuneration it paid to them.

         Burden is on employer to show exemption.

        - In order to be exempt from the Unemployment Compensation Act under subsection C of this section, the alleged employer must show himself to be within the exception of subdivision 1 of said subsection, and within one of the alternative exceptions enumerated in subdivision 2 of the same subsection.

        <b>
         Delivery people not within exemption.
        </b>
        - To include delivery people under the direct seller exemption would expand the direct seller exemption to any number of employees.
        Appellant's argument that sales and delivery are interdependent could be applied to all functions of its business and would allow for exemption of all employees.
        This expansive reading of the direct seller exemption is not in keeping with the statutory purpose; thus, delivery representatives employed by gift box telephone solicitors were not exempt under subdivision 21. Smoky Mt. Secrets, Inc. v. VEC, 12 Va. App. 331, 404 S.E.2d 71 (1991).

        - Subdivision 13 of this section, which was added by the amendment of 1940, excludes from the Unemployment Compensation Act the service of insurance agents and solicitors, provided they are remunerated "solely by way of commission."

        - Where an insurance agent is compensated during a calendar year partly by a guaranteed minimum salary and partly by a commission on the amount of his weekly collections, he is covered by the Unemployment Compensation Act, and the unemployment tax is to be computed on the basis of his aggregate remuneration for that year.

        A guaranteed weekly minimum payment made to an insurance agent prior to the time that his weekly debit collections amounted to a specified sum was a salary and not a commission and, consequently, his remuneration was not solely by way of commission and hence his service was not excluded by subdivision 13 of this section.

     <p>
      When an unsatisfied execution has been returned by an officer, and the employer against whom the judgment has been obtained on which the execution was issued continues in default of payment of taxes, or any portion thereof, such employer may be enjoined from operating and doing business in this Commonwealth until such taxes have been paid. The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to grant such injunction upon the complaint of the Commission. Notice of the time and place when the application for the injunction will be made shall be served on the employer, and a copy of the bill of complaint shall be served with the notice.

        Section does not violate due process.

       - The contention that this section arbitrarily and unlawfully deprives unemployment compensation claimants receiving pensions of a protected property interest, viz., unemployment benefits, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is meritless. Watkins v. Cantrell, 736 F.2d 933 (4th Cir. 1984) (decided under prior law).

       <b>
        Section not unconstitutionally arbitrary or irrational.
       </b>
       - Because ease of administration and preservation of the financial integrity of a state's unemployment insurance compensation program are legitimate state interests that can justify the classifications created by the Virginia pension offset provision, the Virginia pension offset provision is not so patently arbitrary or irrational as to be constitutionally infirm. Watkins v. Cantrell, 736 F.2d 933 (4th Cir. 1984) (decided under prior law).

         Meaning of "available for work."
        </b>
        - As used in this section, the words "available for work" imply that in order that an unemployed individual may be "eligible to receive benefits" he must be willing to accept any suitable work which may be offered to him, without attaching thereto restrictions or conditions not usual and customary in that occupation but which he may desire because of his particular needs or circumstances. Stated conversely, if he is unwilling to accept work in his usual occupation for the usual and customary number of days or hours, or under the usual and customary conditions at or under which the trade works, or if he restricts his offer or willingness to work to periods or conditions to fit his particular needs or circumstances, then he is not available for work within the meaning of the section.

       <p>
        The phrase "available for work," as used in this section, requires a claimant to actively and unrestrictively endeavor to obtain suitable employment in the market where he resides.

        A practical test of the availability for work is the action of the employee in accepting or refusing to accept a job that comes within the provisions of the Act as suitable employment.

        Mere unemployment arising from the economic troubles of the employer does not satisfy the eligibility requirements of this section and entitle the unemployed person to compensation benefits. To be entitled to such benefits the individual must be unemployed because of lack of work and yet must be available for work. He must be ready and willing to accept work without attaching to his willingness to work restrictions or conditions not usual or customary in the occupation, and this is so even though there be no work at hand or available to him.

         Cap on benefits.
        </b>
        - Virginia Employment Commission erred in finding that the employee was ineligible to receive benefits because she was unemployed without fault on her part, and the cap of subdivision 8 did not apply; the employee did not tender or "give" notice because she took no affirmative action to effectively give her notice. Harvey v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 94 Va. Cir. 86, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 119 (Fairfax County Aug. 3, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cap on benefits contained in subdivision 8 does not apply unless an employee gives notice of his or her resignation to the employer; plain meaning mandated by subdivision 8, requires that an employee take some step of affirmative action by granting, bestowing, putting into possession, transferring, conveying, delivering, or offering the notice of resignation to his or her employer. Harvey v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 94 Va. Cir. 86, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 119 (Fairfax County Aug. 3, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Many employees consider leaving their employment or make undirected comments about finding a new place of work, and such comments could be based in truth or simply autoschediastic; thus, courts should be hesitant about opening the door for employers to presume resignation and act without investigation, and a fact intensive, case-by-case determination is necessary in determining whether an employee gives notice of her resignation by taking an action to deliver such notice.

        In an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, however, the standard is quite different; all the employer must do to meet its burden of production is to provide the finder of fact with any lawful nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge; therefore, the findings of the Virginia Employment Commission on the issue of misconduct in connection with employment, reached during a hearing to determine plaintiff's entitlement to unemployment compensation benefits, could not be given preclusive effect in the Title VII action.

        When an employee is discharged for poor performance, he or she is entitled to unemployment compensation unless the employer shows that the conduct resulting in the employee's discharge constituted acts or omissions of such a nature or so recurrent as to manifest willful disregard for the employer's interests. Moreover, the record must establish that an employee's poor performance did not result merely from inexperience or an inability to perform the task assigned. Whitt v. Ervin B. Davis &amp; Co., 20 Va.

        - Employee's use of vulgar language was not of such a nature as to manifest a willful disregard of employer business interests or employee's duties and obligations to his employer. Employee's remarks, while vulgar and offensive, were not a lengthy barrage. They were a part of an isolated outburst following a private two and one-half hour meeting of management officials. The chief executive officer initiated the discussion of union organization at employer's place of business, and repeatedly demanded employee's resignation. Employee had been an employee of employer for almost 20 years. There is no evidence that he had a record of misconduct. There is no evidence that employee's remarks were overheard by store employees or customers. Misconduct has not been proven. Kennedy's Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc. v. Cooper, 14 Va.

        Because the Virginia Employment Commission's determination regarding the witness's credibility was not plainly wrong, the circuit court did not err in upholding the Commission's decision to credit an unemployment compensation claimant's testimony over an employer's; the Commission's finding that claimant received a Christmas bonus with a note indicating that it was for a job well done was supported by the evidence, and the Commission's statement that the check was for "a job well done," after its express finding that the note accompanying the check said, "Thank you for your help," constituted a reasonable inference from the evidence.

         Finding of misconduct not binding on Industrial (now Workers' Compensation) Commission in subsequent proceeding.
        </b>
        - Where an injured employee was dismissed from his selective employment for misconduct and subsequently sought unemployment benefits and reinstatement of his workers' compensation benefits, the Virginia Employment Commission's ruling that the claimant was guilty of misconduct was not binding upon the Industrial Commission, since that issue was not the same as the issue litigated by claimant before the Industrial Commission. The Industrial Commission's inquiry focuses on whether the claimant's benefits may continue in light of his dismissal from selective employment. The key determination is whether the dismissal was "justified." Richmond Cold Storage Co. v. Burton, 1 Va. App. 106, 335 S.E.2d 847 (1985).

        <b>
         Interpretation of subdivision (a).
        </b>
        - The beneficent purpose of the act requires that the disqualifying provisions of subdivision (a) must be interpreted in a manner which allows for the advancement in the work force that occurs when an employee has acquired new job skills through training and experience and in determining suitability of work, prior training and experience are inevitable touchstones of deliberation upon which the commission must focus. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         "Suitability" defined.
        </b>
        - Generally "suitability" entails an evaluation limited to the nature and characteristics of the job in relation to the skills, training, and experience of the particular employee and the length of unemployment. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Suitable employment not synonymous with equivalent employment.
        </b>
        - When an employee with special skills and training has become unemployed, he or she will not be deprived of unemployment compensation benefits because of an offer of employment which would not be reasonably acceptable to an employee with that same background; however, suitable employment is not synonymous with equivalent employment. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         "Suitability" determinations
        </b>
        require consideration of a broad range of criteria, many of which subdivision 3 b enumerates. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         "Suitability" of employment and "good cause" for refusal involve separate determinations
        </b>
        but they are not mutually exclusive and the same factors may, but will not necessarily, be considered in each determination. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determination of "good cause" to refuse employment
        </b>
        will involve a much broader inquiry than merely considering whether the intrinsic aspects of the job are acceptable to the prospective employee, and good cause to refuse a job offer may arise from factors totally independent of those criteria used to determine whether a job is suitable to a particular employee; however, some or all of those factors intrinsic to the job may be considered in combination with extrinsic circumstances to determine whether good cause exists for the employee to refuse the employment. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Prospective employee is entitled to suitable work,

        but he cannot without forfeiting unemployment benefits choose to remain unemployed because the prospective employer does not offer the highest available job for which the employee may be qualified. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Good cause for refusal of job offer not shown.
        </b>
        - The claimant failed to establish good cause for her refusal of an offer by her employer to go back to her previous job at the same rate of pay, although without seniority, with no accrued vacation time and with a requirement that she miss no work for the first 60 days; the loss of seniority and 60 day probation period did not constitute punitive conditions, and she showed no real and substantial reasons for her refusal of the job offer.

         Factors that do not directly affect job suitability.
        </b>
        - Where the conditions were that employee would work the day shift, she would be on probation for one year, she could not bid other jobs for one year, and she accept her discharge as a suspension without pay, those conditions were not factors intrinsic to the particular job and thus, while those factors were important to determine whether she had good cause to refuse the offer, they did not affect the determination whether the job was suitable, since factors that do not directly affect a job's suitability but rather are peculiar to the employee and her situation are factors which are appropriately considered as to whether good cause existed to refuse suitable employment. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Fact that the position from which the employee had been discharged remained vacant was not a factor

       <p>
        <b>
         Commission erred by failing to address factors extrinsic to the nature of the job and the employee's qualifications
        </b>
        which might have justified her refusal of the offer of reemployment since good cause was not limited to a consideration of whether employer offered the job in good faith, and the claimant had the burden to show that good cause existed for her refusal to accept suitable employment. Johnson v. VEC, 8 Va. App. 441, 382 S.E.2d 476 (1989).

        <b>
         Employer refusal of employment justified.
        </b>
        - Considering the conditions imposed upon the offer of reemployment for discharged employee, the circumstances surrounding her discharge, the rights which she would have to forfeit, and the requirement that she would tacitly admit her misconduct, employee was justified in refusing employer's offer of employment.

        Diligence required in addition to good cause for extension of time to note appeal.
       </b>
       - In order to show good cause for an extension of time to note an appeal an appellant must show not only that uncontrollable, necessitous, and compelling circumstances prevented filing an appeal within the enunciated statutory time limit, but also that the appellant acted with diligence, under whatever circumstances existed, in noting the appeal. Tindall v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 66 Va. Cir. 125, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 344 (Richmond Oct. 20, 2004).

      <p>
       <b>
        Employer's lack of diligence in noting appeal meant extension of time was erroneously granted.
       </b>
       - Where employer knew that claims deputy awarded unemployment benefits, yet waited 14 days before sending a letter stating that it did not receive a copy of the determination, then did not follow up the letter for 34 days when it received a copy of the deputy's determination, and then waited another three weeks before filling a notice of appeal, the employer did not demonstrate good cause for the delay or diligence in noting the appeal, both of which were required for an extension of time. An appeals examiner improperly granted the employer an extension after a 71-day delay in filing the notice and, even though the examiner affirmed the award, the Virginia Employment Commission's reversal of that award was invalid since the employer's initial appeal from the deputy was untimely.

       Hearsay evidence was admissible in an unemployment compensation hearing where the employer's statement concerning discharge included information about the claimant's use of profane language that was racially and sexually demeaning. The supporting evidence in the record was not solely hearsay in nature and there was sufficient nonhearsay evidence available in the record to verify information from the hearsay evidence. Nelson v. Va. Empl. Comm'n, 78 Va. Cir. 381, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Norfolk June 16, 2009).

       Because the Virginia Unemployment Commission's findings of fact, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, are made conclusive by subsection A, and the jurisdiction of the circuit courts is confined to questions of law, a circuit court erred in making its own "findings of fact," thereby deviating from its jurisdiction.

       Factual findings by the Virginia Employment Commission in an unemployment benefits case were conclusive that an attorney claimant was not entitled to benefits because he failed to advise the D.C.

        Promptness requirement.

       - Promptness requirement of the statute is mandatory for the Virginia Employment Commission; therefore, in a case involving unemployment compensation, the "promptness requirement" language prevented the Virginia Employment Commission from deciding that a claimant had to repay unemployment compensation more than two years after receiving it. An untimely determination that she was ineligible and required to repay the unemployment compensation was incorrect and unenforceable. Va. Empl. Comm'n v. Cole, No. 1268-15-2, 2016

       - Decision of the Virginia Employment Commission, which ultimately found that the former employee was not entitled to benefits, and that the employee was required to pay back benefits already paid, was affirmed because the employee's job was terminated when he took a hard drive off of the employer's property, conduct that was clearly against the employer's policy.
