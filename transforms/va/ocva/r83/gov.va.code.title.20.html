       - The enactment of this statute wholly abrogated the common law in force in this State on the subject of marriages; and no marriage or attempted marriage, if it took place in this State, can be held valid here unless shown to have been under a license, and solemnized according to the statutes.

        Marriage ceremony before license.
       </b>
       - Trial court properly ruled that a husband and wife never married because their marriage ceremony was not under a license since the husband and wife did not have a license when they held their marriage ceremony, and when they did obtain a license they did not perform any kind of solemnization; mailing a license via express mail for a signature when the parties were not even present did not constitute "solemnization."

       Statute does not expressly state that the license must precede solemnization, but that is its most reasonable reading; statute indicates that, to contract a lawful marriage in Virginia, the parties must obtain a license and, afterward, solemnize their union under that license.

        Performance of ceremony without license.

       - By attaching a criminal penalty to the performance of a ceremony of marriage without a license, the General Assembly clarified its intention that a lawful marriage be contracted by solemnization after a license has been obtained; the statutes make plain the General Assembly's intent that a license must precede the solemnization ceremony.

        Marriage valid.

       - Although the court of appeals correctly reversed the ruling that the parties' marriage was void ab initio, it incorrectly concluded the marriage was voidable upon the challenge of either party because the husband failed to rebut the strong presumption favoring the validity of the marriage; the solemnization agreement did not violate any existing Virginia statute or case law and satisfied the objects of the statute to insure publicity and preserve evidence of marriage.

       Marriage was not voidable or void ab initio because the solemnization agreement, a ceremony followed by the issuance of a marriage license, the joint presentation of the marriage register to a rabbi, and the rabbi's execution of the marriage certificate, did not violate any Virginia statute or case law; therefore, the circuit court had authority to distribute marital assets consistent with the marital agreement and to continue its adjudication of the divorce proceeding.

       Solemnization occurred because a husband and a wife obtained the marriage register and forwarded it to the rabbi pursuant to their agreement, which they made with the rabbi in person at the earlier ceremony, and the rabbi thereafter executed the marriage certificate in accordance with their agreement; by doing so, the husband and the wife repeated and reaffirmed to the rabbi their joint, unqualified intent to marry, and nothing in any statute or case law forbade them from verifying their intent.

        Consideration of foreign common-law marriages.
       </b>
       - A husband's motion to dismiss a wife's divorce action was denied because the Texas statute of limitations for an action to prove a common-law marriage that was in effect at the time the parties allegedly entered into a common law marriage was not applicable pursuant to Virginia's choice of law rules, and Virginia did not have a statute of limitations for such an action, as Virginia required that marriages had to be solemnized by a license in order to be valid.

       - Ceremony contemplated by Virginia's statutes must take place within the Commonwealth, and a ceremony that takes place outside the Commonwealth even if performed by a Virginia-licensed celebrant has no legal effect in terms of creating a valid Virginia marriage; the phrase "in this Commonwealth" in the statute supports the conclusion that the solemnization requirement must occur within the geographic confines of the Commonwealth.

       Marriage of a husband and wife was void ab initio because Virginia case law and statutes clearly dictated that in order to form a valid marriage in Virginia, the parties had to have a Virginia license and a Virginia ceremony, but the husband and wife had the license and lacked the ceremony; given that both a license and a solemnization were required, and the solemnization had to taken place in the Commonwealth, it was not a marriage that "in all other respects was lawful."

      - The 2015 amendment by c. 708 rewrote the section, which read "The clerk issuing any marriage license shall before issuing the license require the parties contemplating marriage to state, under oath, or by affidavit or affidavits filed with him, made by the parties for whom the application is made, before a person qualified to take acknowledgments or administer oaths, the information required to complete the marriage record. Such clerk shall make two certificates thereof and deliver them, together with the license, to the person entitled thereto. For the purposes of this section any statement made by such applicant, under oath, concerning the information to be entered on the record is hereby declared to be a material matter or thing in any prosecution for perjury for any violation of this section."

         Recognition essential.

        - There is a clear intent on the part of the legislature to make recognition by the putative father essential to the legitimation of a bastard. In order for such recognition of a bastard by its putative father to be binding, it must be definite and certain, and one in which the paternity of the child is plainly and unequivocally acknowledged, accepted, admitted or owned by the father.

         Evidence and presumptions as to recognition.

        - Marriage is an evidential fact to be considered along with other evidence in determining the fact of recognition, but it is far from being conclusive, and the surrounding circumstances may be such as to utterly divest it of all weight whatever, as where it is entered into at the point of a pistol. The value of the fact of marriage, therefore, as evidence tending to show recognition, must in each case depend upon the circumstances surrounding and attending the marriage. Hoover v. Hoover,

        The proof of paternity and subsequent marriage may be clear, but that is not enough. The child must be "recognized" by the man as his child. No amount of testimony on the part of the mother or other persons as to the paternity of the child can supply the place of recognition by the putative father. He, and he alone, can fulfill the requirement of the statute that the child shall be "recognized" by him. Hoover v. Hoover,

       - Sufficient evidence supported annulment of marriage based on bigamy where the former husband testified that he went to Pakistan and investigated the former wife's marriage, where he learned that she never divorced her prior husband; the former husband also submitted documentation from Pakistan to prove that the former wife was being charged with bigamy and a warrant for her arrest was outstanding, and an expert explained Pakistani law and how one obtains a religious and legal divorce in Pakistan; once the former wife learned about the legal process, she filed the necessary paperwork, but did so after she married the former husband. The former husband's expert testified that Pakistani divorces were not retroactive, and the trial court found that the testimony of the former husband and his witnesses was more credible than the testimony of the former wife and her witnesses.

       - On an appeal from the dismissal of appellant's claim for compensation for the death of her alleged husband, the evidence showed that claimant, under the erroneous impression that a former husband was dead, married in West Virginia. Under this section the second marriage was absolutely void, while under the former West Virginia Code,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       4701, such marriage was void only from the time it was so decreed. The fact that claimant's second marriage was made in good faith, under a reasonable belief that her former consort was dead, might relieve her from a successful prosecution for bigamy, but would not render the void marriage valid. Hence, her claim was properly dismissed. Toler v. Oakwood Smokeless Coal Corp.,

        Wife was afforded due process.
       </b>
       - An order declaring her marriage void ab initio was upheld, as: (1) she received both a notice and an opportunity to be heard for the judgment hearing; (2) despite her absence and choice not to attend said hearing, her counsel was present; and (3) said counsel failed to object or rebut the husband's evidence of the wife's prior and still existing marriage to another man. Hence, the wife's attempt to rebut said evidence in her motion for reconsideration was properly rejected. Lwasa v. Lwasa, No. 1311-05-4, 2005

       - Since parties' alleged marriage was void ab initio as husband was already married, the court did not have the authority to enforce its spousal support order to the alleged wife that it entered before it declared the alleged marriage void ab initio, and by equitable estoppel principles or otherwise, the parties' spousal support agreement.

        A void marriage, unlike a voidable marriage, does not require an action of annulment to render it void.
       </b>
       Without obtaining an annulment, a party to a void marriage is free to marry again. Conversely, a party to a voidable marriage must obtain an annulment, or any subsequent marriage is bigamous. Kleinfield v. Veruki, 7 Va. App. 183, 372 S.E.2d 407 (1988).

        The strong public policy of this Commonwealth posits that the paramount concern where children are concerned is their best interest

        Child must be a party to paternity action.

       - With the enactment of this section, statutory law makes it clear that a child must be made a party to a paternity action if he or she is to be bound by a determination of paternity. Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, 7 Va. App. 614, 376 S.E.2d 787 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       By requiring that a child be made a party to the action to be bound by its results, the integrity of the fact finding process is enhanced and the rights and interests of the child, which are paramount, are protected.
       The putative father, to ensure that he would not be subject to relitigation of the paternity issue, could have joined the child under Rule 3:9A [see now Rule 3:12], and may now join the child as a necessary party under this section. Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, 7 Va. App. 614, 376 S.E.2d 787 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The child has a fundamental right, not shared by the mother, to establish the father-child relationship, and in exercising that right there clearly is potential for conflict between the mother's interest and the child's interest. Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, 7 Va. App. 614, 376 S.E.2d 787 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a child is not made a party and not represented by an independent guardian ad litem, the child has no control over the litigation, and the integrity of the fact finding process may suffer.
       The child not a party and not adequately represented may not receive his or her day in court, and the fundamental due process right to be heard may be abridged. Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, 7 Va. App. 614, 376 S.E.2d 787 (1989).

        The duty of support of all children is owed to the child, not the mother.
       </b>
       - The amount of the support is based primarily on the needs of the child and the ability of the father to provide, not the needs of the mother.
       Thus, the mother does not have the same legal right as the child in seeking child support; rather, the right is solely that of the child and the mother simply has the right to act as a conduit for the payments of support to the child.

       In the trial of any matter in any court in which the question of parentage arises, the court, upon its own motion or upon motion of either party, may and, in cases in which child support is in issue, shall direct and order that the alleged parents and the child submit to scientifically reliable genetic tests including blood tests. The motion of a party shall be accompanied by a sworn statement either (i) alleging paternity and setting forth facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the requisite sexual contact between the parties or (ii) denying paternity.

       The court shall require the person requesting such genetic test, including a blood test, to pay the cost. However, if such person is indigent, the Commonwealth shall pay for the test. The court may, in its discretion, assess the costs of the test to the party or parties determined to be the parent or parents.

       The results of a scientifically reliable genetic test, including a blood test, may be admitted in evidence when contained in a written report prepared and sworn to by a duly qualified expert, provided the written results are filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least fifteen days prior to the hearing or trial. Verified documentary evidence of the chain of custody of the blood specimens is competent evidence to establish the chain of custody. Any qualified expert performing such test outside the Commonwealth shall consent to service of process through the Secretary of the Commonwealth by filing with the clerk of the court the written results. Upon motion of any party in interest, the court may require the person making the analysis to appear as a witness and be subject to cross-examination, provided that the motion is made at least seven days prior to the hearing or trial. The court may require the person making the motion to pay into court the anticipated costs and fees of the witness or adequate security for such costs and fees.

       20-61.2 would allow the admission of the results of human leukocyte antigen blood tests and a properly qualified expert's opinion concerning the results; once the expert has testified that the blood samples tested were those of the parties involved, that his or her conclusion is based upon facts, circumstances or data made known to or perceived by him or her and normally relied upon by others in that field of expertise, the test results and the expert opinion are prima facie admissible. Commonwealth ex rel. Evans v. Harrison, 5 Va. App. 8, 360 S.E.2d 212 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       A party opposing the admissibility of the test results may attempt to establish, by independent evidence or cross-examination of the expert, that experts in the field do not normally rely on data of the type relied upon the expert in framing his or her opinion, or the opponent of the evidence may also seek to establish, by independent evidence or upon cross-examination, that the blood samples upon which the opinion is based, were not, in fact, those of the parties involved. If either or these factors is not established and reasonable persons would not differ over their conclusion, the trial court should refuse to admit evidence of the test results or, if already admitted, should strike that evidence and instruct the jury to disregard it; on the other hand, if the evidence of both of these factors is such that reasonable men would differ, this affects the weight of the evidence and should be resolved by the fact finder.

        Burden of proof in paternity action.
       </b>
       - The statutory provisions establishing the burden of proof in a paternity proceeding as set forth in this section are procedural provisions.
       Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining the defendant's paternity in accordance with the clear and convincing standard set forth in this section, the standard in effect on the date of trial. Wyatt v. Virginia Dep't of Social Servs., 11 Va. App. 225, 397 S.E.2d 412 (1990).

        Evidence sufficient to rebut presumption of legitimacy.
       </b>
       - Where the husband's evidence consisted of the human leukocyte antigen test results which conclusively disproved paternity and the wife's admission that she had sexual intercourse with another man during a previous separation, this evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption of legitimacy. NPA v. WBA, 8 Va. App. 246, 380 S.E.2d 178 (1989).

       Although this section does not specifically set forth a standard of proof sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy, it does state that clear and convincing evidence is the standard of proof in any action to establish parentage; therefore, the trial court, using the clear and convincing standard, did not err in determining that the evidence before it was sufficient to overcome the presumption of legitimacy.

       A judgment or order establishing parentage may include any provision directed against the appropriate party to the proceeding, concerning the duty of support, including an equitable apportionment of the expenses incurred on behalf of the child from the date the proceeding under this chapter was filed with the court against the alleged parent or, if earlier, the date an order of the Department of Social Services entered pursuant to Title 63.2 and directing payment of support was delivered to the sheriff or process server for service upon the obligor. The judgment or order may be in favor of the natural parent or any other person or agency who incurred such expenses provided the complainant exercised due diligence in the service of the respondent. The judgment or order may also include provisions for the custody and guardianship of the child, visitation privileges with the child, or any other matter in the best interest of the child. In circumstances where the parent is outside the jurisdiction of the court, the court may enter a further order requiring the furnishing of bond or other security for the payment required by the judgment or order. The judgment or order may direct either party to pay the reasonable and necessary unpaid expenses of the mother's pregnancy and delivery or equitably apportion the unpaid expenses between the parties. However, when the Commonwealth, through the Medicaid program, has paid such expenses, the court may order reimbursement to the Commonwealth for such expenses.

     <p>
      An individual may file a petition for relief and, except as provided herein, the court may set aside a final judgment, court order, administrative order, obligation to pay child support or any legal determination of paternity if a scientifically reliable genetic test performed in accordance with this chapter establishes the exclusion of the individual named as a father in the legal determination.
      The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of the child.
      The petitioner shall pay the costs of such test. A court that sets aside a determination of paternity in accordance with this section shall order completion of a new birth record and may order any other appropriate relief, including setting aside an obligation to pay child support. No support order may be retroactively modified, but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for relief from a determination of paternity, but only from the date that notice of the petition was served on the nonfiling party.
     </p>
     <p>
      A court shall not grant relief from determination of paternity if the individual named as father (i) acknowledged paternity knowing he was not the father, (ii) adopted the child, or (iii) knew that the child was conceived through artificial insemination.

        Interpretation of support order.
       </b>
       - Because the trial court had authority to interpret its own order regarding a bond and payment of private school tuition and expenses for a child, it did not abuse its discretion in ordering the mother to contribute to private school tuition and expenses for one of her children.

        Health care coverage.
       </b>
       - The court is not required under this section to determine the amount of health care coverage that will be necessary as there is no way for the court to predict the costs. The trial court, therefore, did not err in ordering father to provide health insurance coverage for his minor children or, at his option, pay all health costs related to said children. Zubricki v. Motter, 12 Va. App. 999, 406 S.E.2d 672 (1991).

       A review of the record revealed no evidence that clearly established wife's medical problems were caused by husband or the breakup of the marriage.

        Judgment rate of interest.
       </b>
       - Because the amount of interest owed by a husband was dependent on the ultimate determination of the husband's child support arrearage, if any, and because the matter was remanded to the trial court for the recalculation of his child support arrearage, the court's interest award had to be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Insofar as the husband's underlying argument as to the amount of child support owed remained pertinent on remand, the trial court did not err in applying the judgment rate of interest from the date each payment of support was due until paid in full or in determining the applicable judgment rate was 9 percent through a certain date and 6 percent thereafter.

       - A father has the right at common law to maintain his children in his own home, and he cannot be compelled against his will to do so elsewhere, unless he has refused or failed to provide for them where he lives, and the statutes providing for the punishment of a father (now spouse) for the failure to support his children, were not intended to change the common law, with respect to the duty of a father to maintain and support his infant children, but merely to more effectually enforce the legal duty.

      Whenever the accused is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court, instead of requiring his or her arrest and personal appearance before the court, the court may allow the accused to accept service of the process or warrant and enter a written plea of guilty. The court may thereupon proceed as if the accused were present and enter such order of support as may be just and proper, requiring the accused to enter into the recognizance hereinbefore mentioned.

        Judgment for contractual arrearages not support order.

       - Where ex-wife brought garnishment proceeding against her ex-husband and the United States to enforce a judgment against her husband for arrearages under a property settlement agreement and to attach the husband's Marine Corps retirement pay, the ex-wife's prior judgment for arrearages was not based upon any arrearages in court-ordered support payments, but upon violations of a contractual obligation; thus the trial court's ruling that the ex-wife's judgment for contractual arrearages was not a court order for her support within the meaning of this section was correct, and it followed that a limitation of 25 percent applied in determining the amount of the ex-husband's federal income that was subject to garnishment for enforcement of the judgment.

        Judgment rate of interest.
       </b>
       - Because the amount of interest owed by a husband was dependent on the ultimate determination of the husband's child support arrearage, if any, and because the matter was remanded to the trial court for the recalculation of his child support arrearage, the court's interest award had to be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Insofar as the husband's underlying argument as to the amount of child support owed remained pertinent on remand, the trial court did not err in applying the judgment rate of interest from the date each payment of support was due until paid in full or in determining the applicable judgment rate was 9 percent through a certain date and 6 percent thereafter.

        "Confirm" not synonymous with "incorporate."

       - An order which "ratified, affirmed and approved" a Juvenile Court Custody Order did not constitute an adjudication of child custody or support issues, because the language "approved, ratified and confirmed" was not synonymous with "affirm, ratify and incorporate." The former merely approved the order while the latter makes it a part of the divorce decree and enforceable as such. Thus, while the trial court took cognizance of the existing order of the juvenile and domestic court addressing custody and support, the court did not exercise jurisdiction over such issues, and the resulting silence continued the preexisting order of the juvenile and domestic court in full force and effect without implicating subsection (a) of this section.

        Husband ordered to pay portion of wife's attorney fees.

        Discretion of court as to counsel fees.

      <p>
       Award of the wife's attorney fees and costs was appropriate because the husband had significantly more income than the wife and with respect to the costs of litigation, there appeared to have been issues with discovery and lack of responsiveness on the part of the husband that increased the wife's attorney fees. Because the parties' settlement agreement limited an award of attorney fees and costs to those related to custody, visitation, and the child support, the court found evidence of fees and costs of $21,181 for those issues, and reduced the amount by 30%, equal to the wife's income percentage.

       Wife estimated that the portion of fees pertaining to litigation was $10,000.00 and given the experience of the court in equitable distribution cases and the facts of this case, that sum was entirely reasonable; though the final decree of divorce was to be entered on a no fault basis, for the purposes of an award of attorney fees, the husband had an overwhelming degree of fault in precipitating the end of the marriage, and the wife was awarded $10,000 in fees.

       Trial court in a divorce case declined each party's invitation to shift attorney fees to the other party because the court considered the circumstances and equities of the entire case and found that equity counseled a ruling wherein each party paid their own fees. Specifically, the court considered that each party was able to pay their attorney given the financial position of the parties, that acts by both parties prolonged the litigation, and that each party chose the lawyers and trial strategy that each party desired.

        Authority lacking to order payroll deductions.
       </b>
       - Where order did not direct husband to pay support, but rather simply amended the terms of the parties' contract, which was not incorporated in the divorce decree, this section did not apply. The statute does not provide for payroll deduction based on contracts, or amendments to contracts, even if signed by a judge. Therefore, the court did not have authority to order payroll deduction.

     <p>
      It shall be the joint and several duty of all persons eighteen years of age or over, of sufficient earning capacity or income, after reasonably providing for his or her own immediate family, to assist in providing for the support and maintenance of his or her mother or father, he or she being then and there in necessitous circumstances.

Where the court ascertains that any person has failed to render his or her proper share in such support and maintenance it may, upon the complaint of any party or on its own motion, compel contribution by that person to any person or authority which has theretofore contributed to the support or maintenance of the parent or parents. The court may from time to time revise the orders entered by it or by any other court having jurisdiction under the provisions of this section, in such manner as to it may seem just.

      All proceedings under this section shall conform as nearly as possible to the proceedings under the other provisions of this chapter, and the other provisions of this chapter shall apply to cases arising under this section in like manner as though they were incorporated in this section. Prosecutions under this section shall be in the jurisdiction where the parent or parents reside.

       - Where both husband and wife had lived in Virginia but currently neither party lived there, and where Virginia circuit court ruled that it was bound by the 1992 South Carolina order, including that court's finding that it had jurisdiction over husband and the subject matter, the trial court erred by declining to exercise its continued jurisdiction to enforce its original support order.

        Initiating state reviews petition for sufficiency.
       </b>
       - Upon the execution and filing of a Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, the initiating state court reviews the petition's sufficiency and determines whether it alleges facts "from which it may be determined that the obligor (appellant) owes a duty of support and that a court of the responding state may obtain jurisdiction of the obligor or his property." If sufficient, the petition is transmitted to the responding state where it becomes the basis of a civil support action against the obligor. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 72, 341 S.E.2d 392 (1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Upon receipt of the transmitted Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, the trial court of the responding state reviews the petition and determines whether it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the laws of the responding state. At that stage the petition is no more than a pleading which contains allegations made for the purpose of presenting the issue to be tried. It confines the introduction of evidence to the relevancy of the issue thus made. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 72, 341 S.E.2d 392 (1986).

      <p>
       <b>
        No time limit between execution of petition and trial.
       </b>
       - There is nothing in the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act statutes which prescribes a time limit between the execution of the petition or accompanying affidavits and the trial. The Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, being remedial in nature, should be liberally construed so that its purpose of providing support for dependent children may be achieved. If there is to be a time limitation on supporting affidavits, it is a matter for declaration by the legislature, not the courts. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 72, 341 S.E.2d 392 (1986).

        Initiating state reviews petition for sufficiency.
       </b>
       - Upon the execution and filing of a Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, the initiating state court reviews the petition's sufficiency and determines whether it alleges facts "from which it may be determined that the obligor (appellant) owes a duty of support and that a court of the responding state may obtain jurisdiction of the obligor or his property." If sufficient, the petition is transmitted to the responding state where it becomes the basis of a civil support action against the obligor. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va.

      <p>
       Upon receipt of the transmitted Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, the trial court of the responding state reviews the petition and determines whether it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the laws of the responding state. At that stage the petition is no more than a pleading which contains allegations made for the purpose of presenting the issue to be tried. It confines the introduction of evidence to the relevancy of the issue thus made. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 72, 341 S.E.2d 392 (1986).

       - There is nothing in the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act statutes which prescribes a time limit between the execution of the petition or accompanying affidavits and the trial. The Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, being remedial in nature, should be liberally construed so that its purpose of providing support for dependent children may be achieved. If there is to be a time limitation on supporting affidavits, it is a matter for declaration by the legislature, not the courts. Dickens v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 72, 341 S.E.2d 392 (1986).

        Decrees enforceable even when not entitled to full faith and credit.
       </b>
       - A foreign divorce decree which does not possess such a degree of finality as to be entitled to full faith and credit under the mandate of the federal Constitution may be recognized and treated with the same force and effect as if it had been entered in this State under the doctrine of comity; such a result is mandated by this chapter.

        Questions of modification must be considered.
       </b>
       - In enforcing a foreign decree for alimony arrearages under the comity doctrine, due process requires that a court consider any questions of modification raised by either party which could have been presented to the courts of the state where the decree was originally entered. Alig v. Alig,

      <p>
       Since this chapter compels the enforcement in Virginia of a registered, though modifiable, foreign decree, it is all the more essential that the parties subject to its terms be accorded all the substantive rights regarding modification granted them in the issuing state. Due process requires no less. A trial judge is correct in applying the law of the issuing state to the retroactive modification issue. Scott v. Sylvester,

       - In an action brought under this chapter to recover arrearages for child support under a divorce decree entered by the Circuit Court of Montgomery County, Maryland, the trial court had jurisdiction to order payment of the full amount of arrearages accruing under the Maryland order, rather than only the arrearages which accrued while the defendant was in Virginia.

        No time limitation to obtain money judgment for support arrearages.

       - Where the foreign support order merely establishes an ongoing, unliquidated spousal support obligation, the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, like the general law of this Commonwealth, provides no time limitation within which the obligee spouse may obtain a money judgment for the arrearages accumulated under such an order.

        Defenses not applicable where order establishes ongoing, unliquidated support obligation.

       A judicial decision is important in reference to a void marriage.
       
       - Although there may be no doubt in the minds of the parties, it is often desirable, and sometimes of highest importance, both to individuals and to the community that there should be a judicial decision in reference to a void marriage, for then the status of the parties and their children is set at rest, and the parties are justified in the eyes of the public in entering into a second marriage.

A plea of res adjudicata or of recrimination with respect to any other provision of this section shall not be a bar to either party obtaining a divorce on this ground; nor shall it be a bar that either party has been adjudged insane, either before or after such separation has commenced, but at the expiration of one year or six months, whichever is applicable, from the commencement of such separation, the grounds for divorce shall be deemed to be complete, and the committee of the insane defendant, if there be one, shall be made a party to the cause, or if there be no committee, then the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the insane defendant.
       

        (b) This subdivision (9) shall apply whether the separation commenced prior to its enactment or shall commence thereafter. Where otherwise valid, any decree of divorce hereinbefore entered by any court having equity jurisdiction pursuant to this subdivision (9), not appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, is hereby declared valid according to the terms of said decree notwithstanding the insanity of a party thereto.
       

        (c) A decree of divorce granted pursuant to this subdivision (9) shall in no way lessen any obligation any party may otherwise have to support the spouse unless such party shall prove that there exists in the favor of such party some other ground of divorce under this section or §

        - Trial court did not err in granting the wife a divorce on the ground of living separate and apart for more than one year and refusing to grant the husband a divorce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion, because trial court was free to choose between the two grounds in granting the divorce and thus, did not abuse its discretion.

        Trial court did not err in refusing to award a husband a divorce on the ground of desertion, because even if grounds existed for the trial court to award the husband a divorce on desertion, the trial court was free to select any sufficient ground in awarding the divorce and it had found that the husband had committed adultery.

        Circuit court properly entered a final decree of divorce based on a one-year separation because, even if the record supported the husband's argument regarding the fault grounds for divorce, the circuit court was free to choose between the grounds presented by the parties, the ground the court used was supported by the evidence, the husband failed to preserved his arguments regarding the distribution of the wife's retirement account and the former marital residence, and the circuit court considered all of the circumstances in declining to award attorney's fees to either party.

         Dual grounds.

        Where dual grounds for divorce exist, the trial judge is not required to grant a divorce under the one year separation statute. He can use his sound discretion to select the appropriate grounds upon which he will grant the divorce. Zinkhan v. Zinkhan, 2 Va. App. 200, 342 S.E.2d 658 (1986).

       </p>
       <p>
        Even if evidence established alternative grounds for divorce claimed by husband, trial court was entitled to grant divorce on the proven ground that parties lived separate and apart in excess of one year. Ingram v. Ingram, No. 1966-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 14, 1999).

       <p>
        Circuit court found father's allegations of cruelty were sufficiently established and corroborated, and mother never challenged the sufficiency of this evidence; because the circuit court was not required to grant a divorce on the parties' one-year separation where dual grounds existed, there was no error in the court's decision to grant father a divorce on the grounds of cruelty.

        - Matter was remanded to the trial court for entry of a nunc pro tunc order because the final divorce decree appeared to contain a clerical error; the parties requested a divorce (a vinculo matrimonii) not a legal separation (a mensa et thoro), and the final order granted a divorce pursuant to subdivision A 1 on the ground of adultery.

         Sufficient evidence of cruelty.
        </b>
        - In an action in which the husband appealed a final decree of the Circuit Court of Henrico County, Virginia, granting the wife a divorce on the ground of cruelty and adjudicating the issues of equitable distribution, spousal support, and attorney's fees, the trial judge did not err in granting wife a divorce on the ground of cruelty; the husband's picking the wife up and throwing her across the bed and onto the floor causing her to sustain serious injuries was conduct so severe and atrocious as to endanger life and indicated an intention to do serious bodily harm.

       <p>
        Trial court properly entered a divorce decree based on a wife's cruelty to her husband, because on more than one occasion, she was arrested for and found guilty of assault and battery against him, and the trial court found the testimony of the husband and his mother as to the wife's cruelty to be more credible than that of the wife.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in granting a divorce based on cruelty because the evidence was sufficient to prove cruelty as the petitioner testified that the petitioner was sleeping on the couch in the parties' house when the petitioner's spouse shot the petitioner in the arm. Moreover, the petitioner relied on a circuit court's issuance of a protective order against the spouse, as well as the spouse's criminal conviction and sentencing orders to corroborate the grounds for divorce.

        Mother was incorrect that the circuit court based its divorce decision on a single act of physical abuse; her argument ignored the circuit court's determination that there were multiple acts of cruelty warranting a divorce. Armstrong v. Armstrong,, 2019

        <b>
         Insufficient evidence of cruelty.
        </b>
        - While the record established that the parties' marriage did not remain harmonious, the record certainly did not prove that one spouse's alleged misconduct met the standard for the cruelty fault ground as there were actions on the part of both parties consisting of angry words, annoyances, and failure to maintain the marital relationship, but the trial court did not find that sufficient to show cruelty.

        - In a no-fault divorce proceeding the trial court did not err in denying the husband's motion to require the wife and her neighbor to answer the questions posed to them regarding adultery, where the record amply supported the court's opinion that it was the husband's own fault and misconduct that caused the termination of the marriage. Assuming, arguendo, that her answers would have been incriminatory, the wife, nonetheless, could have asserted the doctrine of recrimination and prevented her husband from obtaining a fault divorce. The questions posed were simply immaterial. Wallace v. Wallace, 1 Va. App. 183, 336 S.E.2d 27 (1985).

        - Desertion is a breach of matrimonial duty, and is composed: first, of the breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation; and, secondly, an intent to desert in the mind of the offender. Both must combine to make the desertion complete, and a mere separation by mutual consent is not a desertion by either party. Latham v. Latham, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 307 (1878); Crounse v. Crounse,

        Desertion in divorce law is the voluntary separation of one of the married parties from the other, or the voluntary refusal to renew a suspended cohabitation, without justification either in the consent or wrongful conduct of the other. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43 (1871).

        desertion is a breach of matrimonial duty - an actual breaking off of the matrimonial cohabitation coupled with an intent to desert in the mind of the deserting party. Petachenko v. Petachenko,

         Desertion means leaving relationship instead of home.
        </b>
        - Desertion as a ground of divorce does not depend on who actually leaves the family home. It means desertion of the marital relationship. Desertion may be "constructive," for cruelty by one party, which results in the other party's enforced separation, is tantamount to desertion by the party performing the cruel acts. Zinkhan v. Zinkhan, 2 Va. App. 200, 342 S.E.2d 658 (1986).

         "Matrimonial cohabitation" consists of more than sexual relations.

         Desertion must be willful.
        </b>
        - The desertion, to justify a decree for an absolute divorce, must be a willful desertion, and the court to which the evidence is submitted can only determine whether or not such desertion is willful by having all the facts and attendant circumstances fully and frankly presented.

        - But the mere cessation of marital intercourse in the sexual sense or withdrawal from matrimonial cohabitation does not amount to desertion, a necessary element of desertion being the intent on the part of the offender to break permanently the cohabitation or continuance of the marital or family life.

        Husband moving to the family's second home and having sporadic communication and sexual intercourse with the wife did not constitute cohabitation because there was no accompanying resumption of marital duties or cohabitation on a continuous basis, and intent to desert was found from husband's withdrawal of $100,000 from couple's joint bank account a few days before telling his wife he was moving out. Thus, the wife was properly awarded a divorce on the ground of desertion. Gruettner v. Gruettner, No. 0916-04-3, 2004

        - The trial court erred in dismissing husband's cross-bill for divorce on the ground of desertion because of a single act of sexual intercourse between the parties that occurred during the pendency of the case. The jurisdiction of a trial court to adjudicate a divorce proceeding is not destroyed by conduct of the parties that might require dismissal of the bill or cross-bill. Rather, jurisdiction remains in the court to grant or refuse the requested relief in view of the facts as shown by the evidence.

        - Circuit court properly found that a wife proved desertion because the evidence permitted a conclusion that the husband intended to desert the wife when he broke off the matrimonial cohabitation and purchased a home with his former girlfriend several months before he actually left the marital residence.

        It seems well settled that the absenting of one spouse from the other after the institution and during the pendency of a suit for a divorce is not desertion in law and it is not an act upon which a suit for desertion may be predicated. Indeed, in many cases it is highly proper that such physical separation should be, and under many circumstances it is commendable. Hudgins v. Hudgins,

         Failure of husband to maintain wife's authority no justification.
        </b>
        - The wife having left her husband in 1863, upon the ground that he will not control his servants and maintain her rightful authority as his wife, the husband is entitled to a decree for a divorce a vinculo matrimonii on the ground of desertion, on a bill filed by him in 1877.

         Conduct preventing cohabitation justifies desertion.

        - If the husband had repented of his desertion of the wife, and had made any overture with the intention of ending the separation, and any conduct on her part amounting to cruelty to him had prevented his cohabiting with her in the relationship of man and wife, that would have justified his thereafter continuing to live apart from the wife, and, so long as such situation continued, the wife, in contemplation of law, would have been considered as guilty of desertion.

         Departure may be based on reasonable belief of harm.
        </b>
        - If a wife leaves the marital abode for a cause other than to intentionally desert her husband, and the proof of such cause falls short of constituting constructive desertion on the husband's part, yet is sufficient to cause the wife to reasonably believe that her health or well being is endangered by remaining in the household, and, prior to her departure she has unsuccessfully taken whatever measures might be expected to eliminate the concern, then her departure is justified. In such cases the wife is not guilty of desertion because her intent is not to abandon her husband, but rather to shield herself from the cause of such concern. Each such departure must be judged by the trial court on the facts of the case then before it. Brawand v. Brawand, 1 Va. App. 305, 338 S.E.2d 651 (1986).

         Demand during argument that spouse leave is not constructive desertion.
        </b>
        - A husband's requests during arguments that wife leave the home do not support a constructive desertion claim. A bare demand to "get out" does not constitute grounds for divorce based on constructive desertion. Courts should not sever marriage bonds merely because husband and wife, through lack of patience or uncongenial natures, cannot live happily together. Brawand v. Brawand, 1 Va.

         Burden of justifying departure.
        </b>
        - When one of the parties has broken off the matrimonial cohabitation by departing from their place of residence, the burden of going forward with the evidence of justification rests upon the party claiming it, unless such justification appears from the testimony adduced by the other party.

       <p>
        <b>
         When desertion is established, the duty of going forward with evidence of justification and excuse then rests on the defendant,

        unless such justification appears from the testimony adduced by the plaintiff. See Zinkhan v. Zinkhan, 2 Va. App. 200, 342 S.E.2d 658 (1986).

        Justification for leaving the marital home arises where the conduct of the other spouse has caused conditions in the marital home to be intolerable. Kerr v. Kerr, 6 Va. App. 620, 371 S.E.2d 30 (1988).

        <b>
         Misconduct must make marriage intolerable or unendurable.
        </b>
        - Where leaving is alleged to have been caused by misconduct of spouse who remains in family residence, such misconduct must be proved to be so serious that it makes marital relationship intolerable or unendurable. Seehorn v. Seehorn, 7 Va. App. 375, 375 S.E.2d 7 (1988).

         To constitute a defense to the husband's prima facie showing of desertion, the wife must prove
        </b>
        misconduct on the part of the husband sufficient in scope to constitute a ground of divorce in her favor against the husband. One spouse is not justified in leaving the other unless the conduct of the wrongdoer could be made the foundation of a judicial proceeding for divorce. Nothing short of such conduct will justify a willful separation or a continuance of it. Zinkhan v. Zinkhan, 2 Va. App. 200, 342 S.E.2d 658 (1986).

         Intent inferred absent evidence of justification.

        - In the absence of evidence to show justification or excuse for leaving, wife would be guilty of desertion as claimed by husband as the intent would necessarily be inferred. Brawand v. Brawand, 1 Va. App. 305, 338 S.E.2d 651 (1986).

        <b>
         Wife no longer expected to follow husband's change of abode.
        </b>
        - Where a spouse refuses to move from the marital home when the other spouse, because of job opportunity or other reason, moves and attempts to establish a new marital home, whether desertion has occurred depends upon the justification for one spouse's decision to establish a new marital residence and the other's justification for refusing to follow. This determination is not dependent on the spouse's gender; therefore, the outmoded expectation that a wife is expected to follow her husband's change of abode is no longer applicable. Kerr v. Kerr, 6 Va. App. 620, 371 S.E.2d 30 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Wife legally deserted marriage and forfeited her right to spousal support,
        </b>
        and her complaints that husband absented himself from home and his proper share of child discipline while working to provide financially for her and family did not serve as justification for leaving him, where wife's complaint of lack of intimacy in the marriage was no more than reflection of different personalities of these marital partners and where complaint of infrequency of sexual intercourse was pattern developed uniquely between them almost from beginning of marriage. Reid v. Reid, 7 Va. App. 553, 375 S.E.2d 533 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, 14 Va. App. 505, 419 S.E.2d 398 (1992).

        <b>
         Excessive consumption of alcohol no justification.
        </b>
        - Evidence of excessive consumption of alcohol did not as matter of law render cohabitation unsafe by endangering life or health and, therefore, did not support wife's claim of constructive desertion. Seehorn v. Seehorn, 7 Va. App. 375, 375 S.E.2d 7 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Wife was not justified in leaving household.
        </b>
        - Where wife argued that she shared in the housework, the cooking and cleaning, but was not allowed equal standing in the household otherwise, and where no evidence was established that husband's conduct constituted cruelty, nor did any evidence establish that wife reasonably believed her health or well being was endangered by remaining in the marital home, there was no evidence in the record supporting the trial court's finding of legal justification for wife's leaving the marital home; therefore, the court erred in not awarding husband a divorce on the ground of desertion. Lee v. Lee, 13 Va. App. 118, 408 S.E.2d 769 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the evidence failed sufficiently to establish a justification for a wife's final and willful departure from the marital home, the husband was entitled to a divorce on grounds of desertion. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate constructive desertion, as the wife provided no medical evidence from doctors or health care providers to corroborate her claim that the husband's behavior toward her made her "sick."

        The no-fault statute requires that the parties live separate and apart without cohabitation for a specified time period as a prerequisite to securing a no-fault divorce.

        Because both parties were at fault, the only ground for divorce was their separation and the trial court properly refused to grant either party a divorce based upon fault, but granted the divorce on the ground that the parties had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation or interruption for one year.

        Decree denying support must contain findings.
        
        - When a divorce decree, grounded in subdivision (9), denies an award of spousal support (whether expressly or by failure to address the issue), the decree will be reversed and the cause remanded unless the record on appeal reveals that the chancellor made a finding, supported by credible evidence, either (a) that the appellant was guilty of a violation of subdivision (1), (3), or (6) of this section or

         What constitutes abandonment and desertion.
        </b>
        - Abandonment and desertion which entitles a husband or wife to a divorce a mensa et thoro is composed: first, of the actual breaking off of the matrimonial cohabitation, and second, of an intent to desert in the mind of the offender. Both must combine to make the desertion complete. The intent to desert is usually the principal thing to be considered. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43 (1871). See Carr v. Carr, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 168 (1872); Latham v. Latham, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 307 (1878); Smith v. Smith,

        In the absence of justification, proof of an actual breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation, combined with the intent to desert in the mind of the offender, entitles the party deserted to a divorce. Graham v. Graham,

         No definite period of desertion is required by this section

Any desertion which fulfills the requirements of the definition given above is sufficient to sustain the suit, no matter if the parties have cohabited as man and wife for a short period since the first desertion by the defendant.

        Husband moving to the family's second home and having sporadic communication and sexual intercourse with the wife did not constitute cohabitation because there was no accompanying resumption of marital duties or cohabitation on a continuous basis, and intent to desert was found from husband's withdrawal of $100,000 from couple's joint bank account a few days before telling his wife he was moving out. Thus, the wife was properly awarded a divorce on the ground of desertion. Gruettner v. Gruettner, No. 0916-04-3, 2004

        - The trial court erred in dismissing husband's cross-bill for divorce on the ground of desertion because of a single act of sexual intercourse between the parties that occurred during the pendency of the case. The jurisdiction of a trial court to adjudicate a divorce proceeding is not destroyed by conduct of the parties that might require dismissal of the bill or cross-bill. Rather, jurisdiction remains in the court to grant or refuse the requested relief in view of the facts as shown by the evidence. The evidence did not show a break in the separation of the parties with intent to end the desertion. Petachenko v. Petachenko,

        - Wife was granted a divorce based on a husband's adultery because the evidence well exceeded the clear and convincing standard to prove adultery established by the legislature; the husband testified that he deserted the marital residence to reside with and continue an on-going sexual relationship with another woman, who also testified about the necessary corroborative facts of adultery and desertion.

        Court retained in rem jurisdiction over fund although husband died.
       </b>
       - Circuit court retained in rem jurisdiction over a fund specifically created by a valid order of that court: The order established the fund until further order of the court. It neither became a nullity, nor became void, nor was it vacated by operation of law, upon the husband's death, which abated the litigation over the parties' marital status. Instead, the circuit court, a court of general jurisdiction, retained power to dispose of the res, the escrow fund that it had created. Sprouse v. Griffin,

        Meaning of bona fide resident.
       </b>
       - Within the purview of this section, to have been an "actual bona fide resident of this State" for one year (now six months) preceding the institution of a suit for divorce, means to have had in this State throughout that period an actual bona fide permanent abode, as contradistinguished from a sojourn, or transitory abode, in this State or elsewhere. The plaintiff need not have been physically present in Virginia every day during that period; but it is essential that, during such part of that year as he was absent from Virginia, he has actually maintained in good faith at least a locality somewhere in Virginia as his permanent abode. Hiles v. Hiles,
       <cite class="va_code">
        164 Va. 131

       </cite>
       (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person, who has theretofore in good faith established and is then maintaining a permanent abode in the State, goes from the State, and while absent therefrom continuously in good faith maintains that, or some other place or locality in the State, as and for his permanent abode, the establishment of a sojourn, or transitory abode, outside the State will not (so long as his physical residence elsewhere is essentially transitory or a sojourning) put an end to his being an "actual bona fide resident of this State" within the meaning of this section. This is true even though his absence from the State be of long duration. Hiles v. Hiles,
       <cite class="va_code">
        164 Va. 131

       To have been an actual bona fide resident of the state means to have had in the state throughout that period an actual bona fide permanent abode, as distinguished from a sojourn, or transitory abode. Adoteye v. Adoteye, 32 Va. App. 221, 527 S.E.2d 453, 2000

      </p>
      <p>
       For a person to establish the continued maintenance of a place or locality within Virginia as his permanent abode, something more is necessary than the mere intention ultimately to remain in and physically reside in Virginia, with no intention of establishing a permanent residence elsewhere; there must be some evidence of concurring acts or forbearances to act which tend to show the actual continued maintenance in good faith of some place or locality in Virginia as and for his permanent abode.

        Compliance with bona fide resident provision is essential to suit.

       - Compliance with the provision of this section that one of the parties "is and has been an actual bona fide resident of this State for at least one year (now six months) preceding the commencement of the suit for divorce" is essential to the maintenance of the suit and must be established by evidence introduced in the cause, or the suit should be dismissed.

       The defense of the absence of the jurisdictional fact that one of the parties has been domiciled in the State for a year (now six months) preceding the commencement of the suit is not a matter of abatement of the suit, but is in its nature a bar to the suit. Such defense need not be pleaded in abatement, and may be pleaded in bar; and even if not pleaded in bar, the court may and should, for the reason of the public policy, dismiss the suit at the hearing of the cause on the merits, unless the existence of such fact affirmatively appears from the proof in the record.

       Circuit court had jurisdiction over the divorce where the retention of the former marital residence, paying taxes in Virginia, and retention of Virginia drivers' license supported the conclusion that they were bona fide residents and domiciliaries of Virginia for at least six months preceding the filing of the complaint.

        Lack of residency.
       </b>
       - Dismissal of a divorce complaint due to a husband's lack of Virginia residency was proper based on the husband's sworn statements to a court in India that he was a resident of India, designed to specifically invoke the jurisdiction and power of that court, particularly when paired with the husband's extended physical presence in India.

       - Husband's demurrer to a wife's bill of complaint seeking a divorce was overruled as it was possible that the wife remained a Virginia resident and domiciliary since 2001 and lived in the marital home in Florida, and elsewhere, as mere transitory abodes.

         Sufficiency of corroboration.
        </b>
        - The evidence showed that the husband drank to excess, was addicted to gambling, frequently stayed out all night, and was absent from the home for days at a time without communicating with the wife or telling her of his whereabouts. The wife's testimony was to the effect that on one occasion he choked her, on another he struck her, and at times cursed her with vile epithets. Her testimony as to one of the latter incidents was corroborated by that of her brother, and there was also corroboration by both of her parents. It was held that there had been corroboration in all essential matters both by the testimony of the wife's parents as well as by the facts and circumstances of the case. Forbes v. Forbes,

        Where no collusion between husband and wife to obtain a divorce existed, wife's admission of adultery was sufficiently corroborated by an entry in her diary, her testimony that she had sunbathed topless with a male guest in her home, husband's testimony that he had found her arguing with that same houseguest while the guest was nude, and an independent witness' testimony confirming the houseguest's extended presence in the couple's home.

        On the husband's appeal from the parties' final decree of divorce the circuit court did not err in awarding the wife a divorce a vinculo matrimonii and in denying the husband's request for a divorce a mensa et thoro. A divorce could not be granted on the uncorroborated testimony of the parties or either of them and the husband failed to provide corroborating evidence of his grounds for divorce; rather, the record established that the parties lived separate and apart for one year prior to the filing of wife's complaint for divorce.

        Trial court did not err in granting a divorce based on cruelty because the evidence was sufficient to prove cruelty as the petitioner testified that the petitioner was sleeping on the couch in the parties' house when the petitioner's spouse shot the petitioner in the arm. Moreover, the petitioner relied on a circuit court's issuance of a protective order against the spouse, as well as the spouse's criminal conviction and sentencing orders to corroborate the grounds for divorce.

         Husband's testimony alone is insufficient.

        - Where the only evidence in the record in support of husband's charge of desertion is his own testimony, such evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to establish a ground of divorce. As such, it cannot operate to bar permanent spousal support to wife. Hurt v. Hurt, 16 Va. App. 792, 433 S.E.2d 493 (1993).

        It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a wife's request for spousal support, because the evidence was sufficient to prove that the wife's misconduct constituted desertion and constructive desertion, and the wife's assault on the husband after they had separated could be considered; the husband presented sufficient evidence to corroborate the allegations of desertion and constructive desertion.

        Awards for attorney fees and expert witness fees were based on the parties' circumstances and the equities of the case, as required; the trial court had to order the husband to respond to certain discovery requests, and counsel stated that if the husband had been honest about his income, then an expert might not have been necessary, plus the trial court found that the husband conservatively earned $50,000 per month, while the wife earned $2,783 per month, and there was no abuse of discretion in the award to the wife of most of her attorney fees and all of her expert witness fees.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorney fees and costs to a husband because although the husband claimed that the wife's discovery tactics were abusive and costly and warranted a fee award, the line separating discovery abuse and legitimate trial tactics was often narrow, and the differentiation was best left to the sound discretion of the trial court where the tactics were employed.

        Circuit court properly denied a wife's request for attorney's fees because, although wife earned less money than husband, she received half of all marital property in the equitable distribution portion of the hearing, the husband was ordered to pay her spousal support, nothing in the record indicated that husband unnecessarily prolonged the litigation, the case contained many complex and interdependent issues, the wife's behavior was among the circumstances and factors that contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, and Virginia law consistently adhered to the "American Rule," under which attorneys' fees were not recoverable by a prevailing party in the absence of a specific contractual or statutory provision to the contrary.

        Trial court's award of $11,010.85 in guardian ad litem fees, and apportionment of $10,010.85 of the cost to the mother was reasonable because the mother's actions unnecessarily increased the amount of time and expense necessary to conclude the case; the parties were required to attend four separate hearings at the mother's request each concerning the same issue regarding her refusal to undergo an independent psychological evaluation and her repeated, unsuccessful attempts to convince the court to dispense with the requirement; the mother ultimately chose to rest her case rather than submit to an evaluation; and the guardian ad litem presented an exhibit detailing the 40 hours that he spent on the case during the year and a half that it was pending.

        Trial court did not adopt the exact income amount of either expert and noted that in setting the income figure at $50,000 a month, the trial court was being very conservative; both experts agreed that adjustments had to be made to husband's income because he had run personal expenses through his business, and thus the husband created the need for wife to produce expert accounting testimony, and therefore the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding her the expenses associated with the expert.

        - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award a wife attorney's fees in an action challenging a divorce decree under a standard of reasonableness, and noting the absence of the following circumstances: (1) the failure of the trial court to consider statutory factors in equitable distribution; (2) the trial court's error of law; (3) the failure of the trial court to consider or act upon evidence presented as to the relative financial resources of the parties; (4) the existence of a property settlement and separation agreement or prior decree providing for attorney's fees upon specified conditions; or (5) the unnecessary prolonging or compounding of the litigation by a party.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award a wife attorney fees because it considered all of the relevant circumstances of the parties prior to making its decision to deny further attorney fees; after thoroughly considering the evidence, the trial court found that a lot of the attorney fees were incurred pursuing other relief that it did not think was really warranted.

Because the parties' settlement agreement limited an award of attorney fees and costs to those related to custody, visitation, and the child support, the court found evidence of fees and costs of $21,181 for those issues, and reduced the amount by 30%, equal to the wife's income percentage.

       Circuit court's incorporation of a contested separation agreement - which was actually unenforceable at the time it was incorporated into a pendente lite order because of the parties' failed reconciliation after the execution of the agreement - without first inquiring as to the validity of the agreement was reversible error. The husband was entitled to a credit towards the husband's future spousal support obligations, based on the amounts that the husband had already paid, which exceeded the monthly spousal support ordered in the final decree.

       Wife's income from rent, horse judging, horse boarding, and a trust were sufficient to cover her monthly expenses and, thus, adequately meet her needs; since she had substantial separate property, an order that the husband, who was currently unemployed, pay her temporary spousal support would be improper, which meant her request for temporary spousal support was denied.

       In a divorce action where the parties had not physically separated and neither party had engaged in any violence, abuse, or other misconduct, the trial court denied the parties' cross-motions for pendente lite relief seeking exclusive use and possession of the marital home, because under the circumstances, such relief would have facilitated divorce in violation of the public policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia, which was to foster marriage and encourage married people to remain together.

       - Given the interlocutory nature of pendente lite orders, the court finds that such orders may be modified during the pendency of the case regardless of the emancipation of the children; the court relies on the statutory language that such orders shall have no presumptive effect when adjudicating the underlying case. So long as the divorce action is pending before it, any pendente lite order is subject to modification. Morales v. Morales,, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Loudoun County Feb. 10, 2021).

      <p>
       With respect to the husband's motion to modify his child support obligations heard January 13, 2021, the court did not find sufficient evidence of a material change in circumstances to amend the pendente lite order at that time as it related to his request to amend for his short-lived period of unemployment; however, he could present evidence at the final trial as to whether a modification was appropriate as set forth in prior request for relief.

       - "The provision of this section, putting the certified evidence on 'the same footing as a deposition,' could not have been intended to deprive the trial court of the chief benefit conferred upon it by that section - that of seeing the witnesses and hearing them testify. The judge was to hear the case and decide it on its merits, 'independently of the admissions of either party in the pleadings or otherwise,' and, in order to reach a righteous judgment, the statute, for the first time in this State, conferred upon the court the right to 'require the whole or any part of the testimony to be given orally in open court.' The object of the statute was not to save costs to the parties, nor to keep the testimony from the permanent files of the court, but to give the court the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The right to have oral testimony in open court is not conferred upon the parties, but upon the court, and it could only have been for the reasons stated." Barnard v. Barnard,

       Wife was not barred from relying on affidavit testimony based on this statute to prove the jurisdictional grounds for divorce; the trial court held that the affidavits were viable after it denied the husband's counter-complaint because the case reverted back to the wife's original claim in which she submitted the affidavits. Moreover, the trial court granted wife leave of court to proceed upon the affidavits that would establish the separation date. Laveist v. Laveist, No. 1845-15-1, 2016

         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        - The legislature did not intend to make any distinction between decrees for the dissolution of a marriage and decrees annulling a marriage. It did not intend to make ineligibility to marry the ground upon which the support of children of the marriage should be denied. The intent was to authorize a court to make such further decree as it might deem expedient in cases pending before it dealing with the severance of the relations of the parties incident to marriage. Henderson v. Henderson,
        <cite class="va_code">

        , 46 S.E.2d 10 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent of the legislature was to confer upon the court the right not only to settle the status of the parties, but the future rights of each in the property of the other. Furthermore, the court has the right to make decrees concerning the estate of either party, and as to existing property, the court has a right to settle the rights of each party in respect to the other, and if need be to extinguish them.

        - Appellate court did not address whether a circuit court abused its discretion when it awarded one spouse a lump sum spousal support award because the equitable distribution award was reversed on appeal. Therefore, the provisions with regard to the marital property were to be considered on remand, and the court necessarily had to then re-examine spousal support in the light of whatever new or different considerations flowed from the additional proceedings.

        - Trial court did not err in imputing to husband $40,000 per year income, in addition to his retirement pay of $45,000, when the court was determining spousal and child support. The trial court found that husband's pre-retirement income was $80,000, and his retirement pay of $45,000 was insufficient to maintain the family on its pre-retirement level. He was 52 years old, an age at which most people are still employed. His 30 percent service-connected disability did not prevent his obtaining employment.

         Nature of alimony.
        </b>
        - A decree for alimony is something more than an order for the payment of money. A husband who has wronged his wife must continue to contribute to her support. A decree for alimony is an order compelling a husband to support his wife, and this is a public as well as a marital duty - a moral as well as a legal obligation. A decree for alimony is not founded on contract, but on the natural and legal duty of the husband to support the wife. Capell v. Capell,

        - A suit for divorce is a suit to end the marital relation in whole or in part.

         Binding effect of decree on property within State.
        </b>
        - The other essentials to the exercise of the State's power over real property within the State are presence of the res within its borders, its seizure at the commencement of proceedings, and the opportunity of the owner to be heard. Where these essentials exist, a decree for alimony against an absent defendant will be valid under the same circumstances and to the same extent as if the judgment were on a debt - that is, it will be valid not in personam, but as a charge to be satisfied out of the property seized. The court must in some way lay hands on the defendant's property. Bray v. Landergren,

        The right to the amount of a lump sum award, whether payable immediately or in installments is fixed and vested at the time of the final decree and the amount is unalterable by trial court order, remarriage, or death; it necessarily follows that where the right of the recipient spouse to the amount of the lump sum is fixed and vested, the obligation of the payor spouse is also fixed and such spouse may not be relieved of it upon a change in circumstances or by the remarriage or death of the recipient spouse.

        Trial court did not err in utilizing lump sum spousal support as part of an alleged monetary award in equitable distribution because a compelling need existed to award lump sum spousal support to the wife equal to the debt securing the marital residence as the needs of the minor children still residing in the marital home precluded the wife from being able to seek full-time employment to cover the expenses associated with maintaining the debt obligation on the marital residence; and the periodic support award fell well short of being able to cover the amount of the debt encumbering the marital residence, let alone the wife's daily needs.

         Effect of imminent death on lump sum support award.
        </b>
        - The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award the wife a lump sum amount of support when the evidence showed that her death was imminent. The only purpose a lump sum award would have served would be to provide her estate with the spousal support she would have received had she lived. This is not one of the special circumstances or compelling reasons for a lump sum award and such award would effectively have avoided the admonition of this section that spousal support terminates at one's death.

         Lump sum of $600,000, $2,000 monthly support awards upheld.
        </b>
        - It was apparent from the transcript of the proceedings that the trial court considered all the statutory requirements of this section. The evidence proved that wife's earning capacity, if any, was significantly diminished by her physical and mental condition, age, and extended absence from the work force. The trial court found that it would probably be very difficult to start a social work career at her age at this point in her life. In addition, wife's support needs were approximately $4,000 per month, and husband's continued ability to pay was established. The wife's receipt of a lump sum award of $600,000, although considered by the court, was not dispositive of her request for spousal support. The lump sum award was a marital asset to which wife was entitled as a matter of law without regard to need or earning capacity. Because the award appeared fair and just under the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion in also awarding wife $2,000 per month in support.

        Two components of manifest injustice under this statute are conjunctive, not disjunctive, and neither requires proof by clear and convincing evidence independently.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to deny a wife's request for spousal support, because: (1) the evidence was sufficient to prove that the wife's misconduct constituted desertion and constructive desertion; (2) the wife's assault on the husband after they had separated could be considered; and (3) regarding the wife's argument that the trial court failed to consider the economic circumstances of the parties and other factors, the wife could not be heard to complain of actions by the trial court that the wife invited the trial court to take.

The trial court examined each party's income and expense worksheets and held that the husband's earnings were more than sufficient to bear the expenses of each party, that the wife had a continuing need of support, and that the husband's earning capacity was significantly greater than the wife's earning capacity because the wife was no longer able to work due to her disability.

        Trial court properly considered the statutory factors and did not use the pendente lite formula in reaching the ultimate spousal support award for the wife; the award was supported by substantial evidence, given in part the wife's lower income per month and lower education level, plus she was granted a divorce on cruelty grounds based on the husband's pattern of physical abuse.

        Review of a trial court's letter opinion demonstrated that the trial court complied with the statutory requirements in setting an award of spousal support because, at the beginning of the letter opinion section entitled "Spousal Support," the court stated that it considered the factors, and subsequently the court specifically listed the statutory factors that supported its decision. The court was not required to go beyond that and quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration was given to each of the statutory factors. Ware v. Srinivasan, No. 0673-16-2, 2017

        Trial court's decision to impute income to the wife was not arbitrary because the husband's testimony about the wife's condition and behavior, the testimony from the husband's vocational expert, and the husband's cross-examination of wife's medical experts afforded the trial court a factual basis upon which to impute income to wife.

         Evidence insufficient that wife significantly underemployed.
        </b>
        - While husband contended that wife earned more in the past while working the District of Columbia area, that evidence was insufficient to establish that wife was significantly underemployed in her current geographic location. Furthermore, it was irrelevant to the current situation that years earlier, under different circumstances, wife did not obtain additional training. Therefore, husband failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in its award of spousal support to wife. Quinn v. Quinn, No. 0531-97-4, 1997

        - While husband had earned a bonus in the previous three years, the evidence was, at best, inconclusive as to the likelihood of a bonus for 1993. Moreover, where a party's realization of additional income is an irregular occurrence and not contemporaneous with the support proceeding, the trial judge does not abuse his discretion by failing to include the additional income in calculating gross monthly income. Therefore, the trial court did not err in accepting the commissioner's recommended amount of spousal support, notwithstanding the exclusion of husband's anticipated bonus. Merkt v.

The fact that the husband, as sole shareholder of the corporation, and the law firm used firm assets for purposes other than paying the husband's salary and treated his earnings as a loan to the firm did not change the fact that husband had $58,000 earned income.

        - A lump sum award under this section is a form of spousal support and is determined not by evaluating property interests but by consideration of the same factors which are used in determining a periodic award of spousal support. Dixon v. Pugh, No. 1647-90-2 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 13, 1991).

        Since the trial court had to reconsider the equitable distribution of property, the appellate court did not have to rule on whether the trial court erred in awarding the spouse a lump sum spousal support award as opposed to periodic spousal support; accordingly, the spousal support award was vacated and the case was remanded to the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the spousal support award in light of the new equitable distribution award it would be making.

        The requirement that the trial court consider all of the statutory factors necessarily implies substantive consideration of the evidence presented as it relates to all of these factors.

        Husband did not establish that the trial court erroneously applied the principle of the parental generosity rule when it modified the spousal support order and awarded the wife $3,500 per month because the record was replete with evidence indicating that the wife's resources were inadequate to enable her to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the parties' marriage. The wife had incurred significant expenses and liabilities during the interim between the termination of spousal support and her petition for spousal support, she had not been able to provide for her own retirement or maintain her standard of living, and, while the wife's income had admittedly increased somewhat during that time, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that her need was greater than the $1,500 per month awarded in 1998 - almost 10 years earlier.

         Trial court abused discretion.

        - Because the husband's income was insufficient to pay the cost of either party's basic necessities, and because their needs appeared to be basically equivalent, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the wife a significantly disproportionate share of her husband's income. There was no explanation as to why the court awarded the wife 71 percent of the husband's income, leaving him with insufficient funds to pay for his basic necessities, and no justification for such action was apparent from the record.

       <p>
        The trial court erred by awarding wife 50 percent of the $13,000 in retirement benefits husband earned during his employment with the Commonwealth of Virginia because the portion of the retirement proceeds that were earned after the parties separated are the husband's separate property. Retirement benefits earned after spouses have last separated, with the intent to remain permanently separated, are not marital property and, therefore, not subject to equitable distribution.

         Subject matter jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Trial court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to modify an award of equitable distribution and terminate direct payments to a former husband's ex-wife from the husband's military retirement based on an alleged change of circumstances. Accordingly, the court would not entertain the question of whether the ex-wife's alleged participation in a relationship with a partner whom the ex-wife had allegedly "collared" was a contractually binding marriage as defined in the parties' separation agreement.

         Nature and purpose of suit for alimony.
        </b>
        - Where there was scant evidence of the parties' relative needs and abilities and the wife's sole purpose in seeking spousal support was to equalize a post-bankruptcy marital debt, the court declined to make a spousal support award.

         Reservation of right.

        - Court lacked jurisdiction to make the spousal support award under this section, because the parties were married for about 10 years and the reservation could only have lasted for a period equal to 50% of that time, or around five years, and the award was made about eight years after parties separated.

        The court decided that 73-year-old husband did not have to keep working or have income attributed to him as though he was working to determine the amount of spousal support to the wife, because: (1) he was 73; (2) the marriage lasted 9 years and had no children; (3) he was retired when they married; (4) except for a phone card business the income from which was already taken into account, he was presently not working; and (5) she was gainfully employed.

        A material change in a former husband's circumstances warranting a reduction in the husband's monthly support obligation for an undefined period of duration was found because the husband had experienced a substantial reduction in the husband's income.

        - In determining custody and visitation of minor children, the best interests of the children are paramount. In making this decision, a court must consider those factors enumerated in this section prior to the 1994 amendment. A change of custody is warranted if a change of circumstances has occurred since the most recent custody award and the requested change of custody is in the best interests of the child. Bourne v. Frey, No. 2565-93-4, 1994

        In custody disputes the welfare of the children is of primary and paramount importance. Simmons v. Simmons, 1 Va. App. 358, 339 S.E.2d 198 (1986); Venable v. Venable, 2 Va. App. 178, 342 S.E.2d 646 (1986).

        - Evidence of adultery, without more, is an insufficient basis upon which to find that a parent is an unfit custodian of his or her child. However, in determining a child's best interest, the extent to which the child is exposed to an illicit relationship must be given the "most careful consideration" in a custody proceeding. Furthermore, adultery is a reflection of a parent's moral values which should be considered in evaluating the moral climate in which a child is to be reared. Brinkley v. Brinkley, 1 Va.

        - After a material change of circumstances has been established, a trial judge, in determining the best interests of a child, may properly consider the factors set forth in this section; those factors are normally considered in a custody hearing and include any other factors as are necessary to consider the best interests of the child or children.

         Test for determining whether change in custody is warranted

        is two-pronged and requires: (1) A change in circumstances since the most recent custody award, which encompasses not only negative changes in the home of the custodial parent but also positive changes involving the noncustodial parent; and (2) that a change in custody be in the best interest of the children.

       <p>
        When a petition to change custody is filed, the trial court, in determining whether a change of custody should be made, must apply a two-pronged test, to-wit:
        (1) whether there has been a change in circumstances since the most recent custody award; and (2) whether a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child. Holloway v. Holloway, No. 1744-89-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 23, 1990).

        - It is rare when a court can be positive, at the time, that its award of custody will prove to be for the best interest of the child, which is the paramount question.

        There was no question mother's husband had sufficient notice, as the trial court spoke directly to mother's husband and ordered him to avoid making any comments about father in the presence of the children.

       <p>

Eichelberger v. Eichelberger, 2 Va.

         Moving child away from noncustodial parent.
        </b>
        - A parent's devotion is in a child's best interest only when expressed in a manner beneficial to the child. When considering whether a child may be moved away from a noncustodial parent, the question is whether the benefit is available to the child only if he or she lives in close proximity to the noncustodial parent. Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, 2 Va. App. 571, 347 S.E.2d 149 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A noncustodial parent always has an added difficulty in maintaining a relationship with a child when the child lives some distance away. This increased difficulty alone should not be allowed to deny a custodial parent the freedom to choose where he or she and the children will reside. Therefore, the added difficulty in maintaining a beneficial relationship between a child and a noncustodial parent should not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent's residence except where the benefits of the relationship cannot be substantially maintained if the child is moved away from the noncustodial parent. Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, 2 Va. App. 571, 347 S.E.2d 149 (1986).

         Removal of child to another state.

        - It is not the law in Virginia that custodial parent seeking permission to remove children from the Commonwealth must establish a real advantage to that parent in the move or that the move is not inimical to the best interests of the children. The rule in Virginia merely states that the move will be allowed if the trial court determines that it is in the best interests of the children. Simmons v. Simmons, 1 Va. App. 358, 339 S.E.2d 198 (1986).

       <p>

But in either instance the determination must be based on the child's best interest. Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, 2 Va. App. 571, 347 S.E.2d 149 (1986).

         Contempt order for failure to pay support invalid where jurisdiction lacking in original decree.
        </b>
        - Although the circuit court entered a valid divorce decree, it lacked personal jurisdiction over the husband when the divorce decree was entered in 1985 and it had no power to enter an enforceable support order. Consequently, the judge's order ruling the husband in contempt for violating the support provisions of the 1985 divorce decree was reversed and the rule to show cause was dismissed. Price v. Price, 17 Va. App. 105, 435 S.E.2d 652 (1993).

         The distribution anticipated by the General Assembly

        is predicated upon the philosophy that marriage represents an economic partnership requiring that upon dissolution each partner should receive a fair proportion of the property accumulated during marriage, including property titled in the other party's name but which has appreciated in value due to the nonmonetary efforts of the nonowner spouse.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in appointing an ex-wife's counsel as special commissioner in regard to the sale of the parties' house, as the ex-husband unreasonably refused to cooperate with the sale of the house; as a result of the husband's conduct, the trial court ordered that the wife's counsel was authorized to provide the ex-husband's signature wherever required to effectuate the sale of the house. This order did not appoint the commissioner, who was authorized only to provide husband's signature, to act in a judicial capacity; the execution of the necessary documents to complete the sale pursuant to the court's orders were purely ministerial acts, rather than alterations in the substantive terms of the court orders.

         Brandenburg v. Brandenburg
        </i>
        to trace and determine the value of the marital and separate property components of couple's hybrid property, commissioner erred when he calculated the value of husband's separate property in home and promissory note by including the amount husband paid for the improvements rather than the value which the improvements added to the property.

        Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting a husband's motion to bifurcate the divorce matter from the remaining issues because the record supported its judgment that bifurcation was clearly necessary; the circuit court made an express finding that bifurcation was "clearly necessary" and referenced specific factors, including the husband's declining health and delays by the parties.

         Contempt order proper.
        </b>
        - Circuit court did not err by holding a former husband in contempt of court for the former husband's willful failure to comply with a court order and the payment obligations set forth in the parties' property settlement agreement that was incorporated into the parties' final decree of divorce because the court was entitled to enforce the obligations through its contempt power. Kahn v. McNicholas, 67 Va. App. 215, 795 S.E.2d 485 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finality was not imposed on a circuit court's final order of divorce after twenty-one days because the circuit court possessed, as provided by statute, the jurisdiction to enforce its final order of divorce and to issue and enforce further orders with respect to the parties' divorce. Thus, the circuit court had jurisdiction to find that the former wife was in contempt for failing to obey the court's subsequent orders after the divorce that the wife pay certain sums to the former husband. Khakee v. Rodenberger, No. 2001-18-4, 2019

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to find a husband in willful contempt because due to his noncompliance with the parties' property settlement and support agreement, condominiums were sold at foreclosure, resulting in reduced proceeds; the circuit court acted within its discretion to impose a sanction to compensate the wife for the financial loss that resulted from the husband's noncompliance with his obligations to pay the condominium mortgages.

         Continuing jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Subsection K of this section provides for the continuing jurisdiction of a trial court to enter orders necessary to effectuate and enforce any order entered pursuant to the statute. Such orders include pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, and retirement benefits for the purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). Hence, the trial judge did not err in entering orders necessary to effectuate and enforce the final divorce decree, which affirmed, ratified, and incorporated the parties' agreement specifying the division of the husband's retirement assets and IRA account. The entry of these orders involved purely ministerial acts related to the QDRO. Myers v. Myers, No. 1034-01-2, 2001

        Where a final divorce decree provided that the wife would be entitled to 50% of the marital share of the husband's pension, a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) was properly entered after the husband's retirement, because the QDRO did not create substantive rights, but only effectuated the express intent of the final decree.

         Jurisdiction to adjudicate distribution not retained.
        </b>
        - Although wife invoked this section, the court found nothing in the statute giving the circuit court jurisdiction to adjudicate wife's claim to equitable distribution. The circuit court awarded the divorce and did not retain jurisdiction in the divorce decree to adjudicate equitable distribution after entry of that decree; thus the circuit court had no jurisdiction to consider wife's filing under the provisions of this section.

        Wife failed to protect her interests in having the circuit court adjudicate her equitable distribution rights. Under this section, wife could have requested the circuit court to adjudicate her rights prior to entering the divorce decree; she also could have moved the circuit court to retain its jurisdiction and adjudicate those rights after entering the divorce decree. She did neither. Wife's failure to protect her interests does not substantively adjudicate her equitable distribution rights, but does bar her from asserting those rights in a Virginia court.

        - While the mere fact that an order labeled as "final" is not dispositive of its finality, the plain, obvious, and rational meaning of the statutory language "final decree of divorce" clearly suggests a statutory classification of finality for the purposes of appeal.

       <p>
        Court order properly bifurcating a divorce proceeding is a final order with respect to the divorce issue, thereby falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the court of appeals twenty-one days after its entry; however, the statute also contemplates that following such bifurcation, the circuit court retains jurisdiction over all other remaining matters explicitly reserved for future adjudication.

        Use of the phrase "final decree of divorce" by the General Assembly to reference a circuit court order reserving jurisdiction to adjudicate equitable matters at some future date, clearly suggests that, following bifurcation of the divorce from the remaining matters, the circuit court loses jurisdiction over the divorce decree twenty-one days from the entry of the order; in such a case, the statute clearly permits an appeal to the court of appeals from such a final order of divorce.

        Circuit court did not err in interpreting a marital settlement agreement to include the extra three years of a husband's employment as a partner in his firm in calculating retirement benefit payments owed to the wife because the fraction of the total retirement benefit payments that made up the marital share was clearly defined by the settlement agreement.

        - The legislature enacted this section to give the courts power to compensate a spouse for his or her contribution to the acquisition of property obtained during the marriage without regard to title when the marriage is dissolved. Sawyer v. Sawyer, 1 Va. App. 75, 335 S.E.2d 277 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority of the divorce courts, applying specifically enumerated factors, to reach an equitable resolution of the issue of the division of the jointly acquired wealth of the spouses during their marriage is in addition to rights of spousal support and is not limited to traditional notions and limitations of title ownership. Rexrode v. Rexrode, 1 Va. App. 385, 339 S.E.2d 544 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        By enacting this section the General Assembly enabled the divorce courts to recognize the contributions made by both parties to the marriage, whether monetary or nonmonetary, when considering division of their property upon the dissolution of a marriage. Price v. Price, 4 Va. App. 224, 355 S.E.2d 905 (1987).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        The "equitable distribution" statute is intended to recognize a marriage as a partnership and to provide a means to divide equitably the wealth accumulated during and by that partnership based on the monetary and nonmonetary contributions of each spouse.

       </p>
       <p>
        When the General Assembly authorized partition in the equitable distribution proceedings, it did so not only to enable the court to effect a change in legal title, but to enable a court to resolve issues based upon facts and findings common to both proceedings in order to avoid inconsistent results from separate proceedings.

        - By allowing the trial judge to order a transfer of jointly owned real property, this section, as amended in 1988, takes away completely the right to insist upon retention of ownership of a particular piece of real property; this section may not be applied so as to affect such a substantive right in pending proceedings.

        This section, as amended in 1988, gave the trial judge discretion in a divorce proceeding to order a transfer of the property to one of the parties without first determining whether partition in kind could be conveniently made.
        Thus, under the amended statute, one spouse in the divorce proceeding could be deprived of ownership of real property susceptible to partition to which that spouse would have been absolutely entitled under

        - In addition to classifying property, the trial judge must determine the ownership and value of all real and personal property of the parties. In some cases, where the parties have been given a reasonable opportunity to provide the necessary evidence to prove valuation and through their lack of diligence have failed to do so, the trial judge may make a monetary award without giving consideration to the value of every item of property. However, a trial judge may not arbitrarily refuse to classify or evaluate marital or separate property where sufficient evidence to do so is in the record. Rein v. Rein, No. 1120-93-1, 1994

No evidence suggested that a fraud or other injustice was perpetrated on her when the marital residence was purchased, there was no evidence before the court that she was promised or believed she had acquired an ownership interest in the property, and her contribution to the down payment on the property was never acknowledged in any contract, agreement or other instrument.

That potential liability is a proper consideration in the determination of a property division and an award if it is not speculative; however, here, by basing its appraisal of defendant's dental practice on potential liability resulting from a hypothetical sale, the trial court constructed an appraisal that was not based on the fair market value of the property and was thus error.

        - Where a party asks the trial court to make an equitable distribution of a pension under the immediate offset method but fails to provide credible evidence of present value, the court has insufficient evidence with which to make an award under the immediate offset method, while if the trial court orders deferred distribution of the marital share of the pension, it need not determine the pension's present value. Hence, the trial court, in the absence of evidence of the present value of husband's Virginia Retirement System (VRS) pension, did not abuse its discretion by not making a finding of fact as to its present value, and in awarding husband, as part of its equitable distribution award, one hundred 100% of the marital share of the VRS pension benefit he had already begun to receive on a monthly basis.

        Husband failed to show good cause why the valuation date of the parties' business, a newspaper, should be the date of separation rather than the date of an evidentiary hearing, as the husband never testified that the value of the business increased after the parties' separation. Absent evidence permitting the trial court to grant him the relief he requested, it could not be said that the trial court erred in denying his motion for an alternate valuation date. Pearson v.

        Because the trial court found that insufficient evidence of value was presented regarding the value of the business, but inherent in the trial court's decision to monetarily compensate the wife for her interest in the business was a finding of some value for the business, the trial court's valuation and distribution decisions were contradictory and could not be reconciled, and the trial court erred either in concluding that the evidence did not allow it to determine a value for the business or in compensating the wife for an asset it had concluded could not be valued because of a lack of evidence.

         Classification of property: multiple source and multiple destination tracing.
        </b>
        - In addition to question of "multiple source tracing," in which marital and separate property are combined to acquire a single piece of hybrid property, is the problem of "multiple destination tracing," in which only a portion of hybrid property is used to acquire or invest in additional properties, either simultaneously or successively. To determine whether a party's separate property can be retraced under such circumstances, courts have adopted widely varying approaches to address the character of withdrawals from hybrid accounts; whatever approach is used however, it is clear that in the absence of sufficient evidence establishing the identity of separate funds throughout the multiple investments and withdrawals, the asset in question must be deemed marital.

        Where husband presented insufficient evidence from which the court could determine the identity of his separate funds, and distinguish them from the marital property in the hybrid asset, viz., the parties' last house, the unknown amount contributed from the separate source transmutes by commingling and becomes marital property.

        - Even if the amount of marital property that is commingled with separate property is insubstantial, if it is nevertheless significant to the marital relationship, that contribution is sufficient to trigger the presumption that the separate property has been transmuted to marital property.

         Post-separation payments of separate funds on marital property presented commingling scenario.
        </b>
        - Trial court did not err when it failed to award husband a credit for his post-separation mortgage payments on farm property. Husband did not contest the trial court's classification of the farm property as marital. Husband incorrectly couched these payments as the post-separation acquisition of separate property. Instead, because the farm property was marital, any post-separation contribution by husband of his separate funds that increased the value of the farm property presented a commingling scenario. In this case, husband offered no evidence that established the source of the funds he used to make the post-separation payments on the mortgage. Raab v.

        Where a former husband had sole possession of the marital property during the parties' separation and rented it to third parties, the trial court properly considered the fair rental value of the property as part of its equitable distribution award; that the husband held sole legal title to the property while it was being rented was immaterial, as it was undisputed that the property was marital.

         The goal of the tracing process
        </b>
        is to link a transmuted asset to its primary source, which is either separate property or marital property; whether a transmuted asset can be traced back to a separate property interest is determined by the circumstances of each case, including the value and identity of the separate interest at the time of the transmutation.

        - Where evidence revealed that shares of stock given by husband's father and brother prior to the marriage, and the 451 shares given by husband's father during the marriage, did not appreciate due to effort of either husband or wife, the evidence failed to support a finding that the shares of stock received from father and brother were transmuted into marital property.

         Increase in value of property.
        </b>
        - If spouse proves that passive factors account for a portion of the increase in the value of his stock, such increase cannot be properly classified as marital property. Similarly, where third parties contribute to the increase in value of separate property, the marital portion is to be reduced proportionately. The increase classifiable as marital should reflect only that attributable to the parties' personal efforts and not those of others or passive factors. DeHaven v. DeHaven, No. 0997-96-4, 1997
        <cite class="va_code">
         Va. App. LEXIS 208

        (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 8, 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to establish that the increase in the value of the marital residence was marital property, wife had to prove either that contributions of marital property or her personal efforts or both resulted in the increase, and that the personal effort was "significant" and resulted in "substantial appreciation" of husband's separate property interest in the marital residence. Martin v. Martin, 25 Va. App. 551, 489 S.E.2d 727 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife's evidence supported conclusion that she made "significant personal effort" which resulted in the substantial appreciation of husband's separate property and husband put on no evidence to the contrary, the trial court could properly classify as marital property the entire increase in value of husband's separate property at the time of the purchase. Martin v. Martin, 25 Va. App. 551, 489 S.E.2d 727 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife did not support conclusion that she made "significant personal effort" which resulted in the substantial appreciation of husband's separate property, where other than her conclusory assertion that she had some real estate "acumen," she offered no evidence to prove the property was more valuable than the price paid or that husband relied upon her "personal efforts" in investing in property. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection A contemplates a "significant personal effort" that substantially affects the value of the property, not merely a joint decision that may have been influenced by one spouse. "Significant" is defined as having or likely to have influence or effect; deserving to be considered; important, weighty, notable. Therefore, wife's efforts were not "significant" factors affecting the value of the property where evidence proved nothing more than that she and her husband decided to purchase the property because she thought it would be a good investment. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party does not meet the burden of proving that "contributions of marital property were made" under subsection A by merely establishing that marital funds were expended for customary maintenance and upkeep of the property. The term "contribution of marital property" within the meaning of this section contemplates an improvement, renovation, addition, or other contribution which, by its nature, imparts intrinsic value to the property and materially changes the character thereof. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        When subdivisions A 1, A 2, and A 3 a of this section are read together, they provide that where separate property can be retraced from commingled property, the increased value in that separate property is presumed to be separate, unless the non-owning spouse proves that contributions of marital property or personal effort caused the increase in value. Once the non-owning spouse overcomes the presumption of separateness of the increase in value, the burden shifts to the owning spouse to prove that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contribution of marital property or significant personal effort. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred, as an initial matter, by failing to determine whether and to what extent husband's separate property interest in home increased in value, attributable to the passive appreciation in the market value of the property, exclusive of improvements or additions resulting from marital contributions or significant personal effort. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Virginia has not adopted an exclusive method for determining how to apportion the increase in value of retraced separate property, the trial court should have applied the "Brandenburg formula" or other acceptable method, to initially calculate the increase in value of husband's separate property share of the marital residence. Martin v. Martin, 27 Va. App. 745, 501 S.E.2d 450 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The increase in value of separate property becomes marital if the expenditure of marital funds or a married party's personal efforts generated the increase in value. The significant factor, however, is not the amount of effort or funds expended, but rather the fact that value was generated or added by the expenditure or significant personal effort. Moran v. Moran, 29 Va. App. 408, 512 S.E.2d 834 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The expenditure of marital funds in connection with a separate asset does not, without more, justify classifying an increase in value or appreciation of that asset as marital rather than separate property. Moran v. Moran, 29 Va. App. 408, 512 S.E.2d 834 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The discharge of a debt secured by an asset that results in an increase in equity in the asset constitutes an increase in value. Gilman v. Gilman, 32 Va. App. 104, 526 S.E.2d 763 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent a non-owning spouse claims that an increase in value of separate property was attributable to personal efforts, the non-owning spouse must prove that the personal efforts were "significant" and resulted in "substantial appreciation" of the owning spouse's separate property interest. Gilman v. Gilman, 32 Va. App. 104, 526 S.E.2d 763 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court erred in treating all of the increase in value of stock in a family business owned by the husband as marital property where it was clear that a significant portion of the increase in value was due to the efforts of the husband's brother and to passive factors affecting the business; the increase classifiable as marital should have reflected only that attributable to the husband's personal efforts.

        A trial court erred in refusing to reevaluate stock owned by the husband where, following the initial valuation and while the case was pending on appeal, the husband sold the stock for more than four times the value estimated by the expert witnesses at the time of the initial evaluation.

        Where an asset that is subject to equitable distribution is retained by one of the parties for a period of time after valuation but before the equitable division occurs, and where the asset significantly increases or decreases in value during that time through neither the efforts or fault of either party, neither party should disproportionately suffer the loss or benefit from the windfall; under those circumstances, a trial court abuses its discretion by failing to re-value the property when a party has made a timely motion to do so and is prepared to present evidence on the issue.

        Trial court properly found that the increase in the value of a second disputed property during the parties' marriage was marital property where: (1) the property was purchased with the husband's separate property funds; (2) the wife met her burden of showing that the efforts of both the husband and the wife contributed to the increase in value; and (3) the husband did not present any credible evidence to prove that the increase in value was not caused by contributions of marital effort, and conceded that some of the increase in value derived from his efforts to assemble the lots during the marriage.

        - On the husband's appeal from the parties' final decree of divorce, the circuit court did not err in declining to consider the hybrid vehicles when determining the equitable distribution award because the husband provided no evidence that the vehicles increased in value; such evidence was required to show what portion of the hybrid vehicles' value was marital.

        Evidence proved that the wife acquired the former marital residence by a deed of gift from her father, so it was presumptively her separate property; regardless of any contributions or personal efforts that the husband might have made, he presented no evidence about the value of the former marital residence, and thus he failed to meet his burden of proving that the home's value increased.

        - While subsection C empowers the court to partition marital property in the names of both parties, nowhere else in the statute is the court authorized to assign, allot, or divide marital property titled either in both names or a single name, absent agreement between the parties. The trial court erred in allotting to the wife personal property titled in the husband's name. McGinnis v. McGinnis, 1 Va. App. 272, 338 S.E.2d 159 (1985).

        Effect of 1988 amendment.
        
        - The 1988 amendment to subsection C of this section gave the trial judge discretion to order a transfer of the property to one of the parties without first determining whether partition in kind could be conveniently made; thus, under the amended statute, a transferor could be deprived of real property susceptible to partition in kind to which he or she would have been absolutely entitled under

        Trial court judgment in a divorce action awarding a wife 25 percent of the husband's share in a group home enterprise was upheld on appeal, because the enterprise was created by the husband and wife during the marriage, the wife contributed significant amounts of time and effort in establishing the group home, including using the medical license she obtained for the benefit of the home, and the wife's income from her work as a physician was the family's sole means of support in the early days of the husband's development of the enterprise. The valuation of the business was upheld, because the husband failed to offer any independent evidence as to the fact and amount of alleged loans against the enterprise and the trial court had the discretion to expressly accept the testimony of the wife's expert with regard to the value of the husband's share.

        - Trial court did not err in utilizing lump sum spousal support as part of an alleged monetary award in equitable distribution because a compelling need existed to award lump sum spousal support to the wife equal to the debt securing the marital residence as the needs of the minor children still residing in the marital home precluded the wife from being able to seek full-time employment to cover the expenses associated with maintaining the debt obligation on the marital residence; and the periodic support award fell well short of being able to cover the amount of the debt encumbering the marital residence, let alone the wife's daily needs.

Once it has been determined that a monetary award is appropriate, the trial judge must determine the amount of the monetary award after considering the factors mandated by subsection E. Therefore, proof that the monetary award does not reflect an equal division of marital property is not alone sufficient to reverse the award, provided the trial judge considered all the factors enumerated in subsection E in determining the amount.

Although subsection G as it read prior to its amendment required the trial court to identify that portion of the award based upon retirement benefits, that provision cannot be construed as authorizing multiple monetary awards. Furthermore, the statute now clearly indicates that the monetary award is not composed of discrete parts each based upon one of the enumerated factors, but is rather a single entity whose total amount is determined by examination of the subsection E factors.

        It was error to offset a husband's equitable distribution monetary award against the end of a wife's spousal support award because this effectively conditioned the monetary award on future circumstances assuming the wife would be due spousal support for the full term ordered, contrary to the equitable distribution statute's purpose, which was different from that involved in awarding support.

         Segregation of certain real estate from other marital property held error.

        - Trial court erred when it segregated farm from other marital property and made a monetary award based solely upon the equities of each party in the retirement benefits. Such a segregation of the property was fatal to the award for several reasons: (1) The statutory factors of subsection E must be applied to all of the marital property that is considered for equitable distribution; (2) the court must consider, among other things, how and when specific items of marital property were acquired and the parties' contributions, both monetary and nonmonetary, to the acquisition, care and maintenance of the specific items; and (3) the effect of segregating the real estate was necessarily to make an equal division of it apparently without considering the equities of the parties in the real estate. The farm had been in wife's family since 1793. She acquired title in 1960 and held it as sole owner until the mid-seventies when husband made a monetary contribution to construct a house on the farm - which contribution was small in comparison to the farm's value.

The court added up each finding of value and then specifically inquired of counsel whether there were any other assets or liabilities that the court needed to consider. Husband presented his tax argument to the court and discussed the liabilities of the parties and those liabilities associated with each property. After the court totaled up all the respective values and allowed for the associated liabilities, it determined the appropriate amount of the lump sum award. Gottlieb v. Gottlieb, 19 Va.

        <b>
         Impact of fault on award calculation.
        </b>
        - Equitable distribution is predicated upon the philosophy that marriage represents an economic partnership requiring that upon dissolution each partner should receive a fair portion of the property accumulated during the marriage. Therefore, circumstances that affect the partnership's economic condition are factors that must be considered for purposes of the equitable distribution scheme. Circumstances that lead to the dissolution of the marriage but have no effect upon marital property, its value, or otherwise are not relevant to determining a monetary award, need not be considered. Aster v. Gross, 7 Va. App. 1, 371 S.E.2d 833 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule established in
    Aster v. Gross
    , 7 Va. App. 1, 371 S.E.2d 833 (1988), that circumstances leading to the dissolution of the marriage but having no effect on the marital property or its value are not relevant to determining the monetary award, was meant to require proof of some relationship between the fault and the marital estate, to require objectivity to the trial court's decision making on equitable distribution, and was focused on a couple's monetary contributions. The purpose was to eliminate arbitrary monetary awards that punished a spouse for his or her fault without showing such a fault had an economic impact on the marriage. O'Loughlin v. O'Loughlin, 20 Va. App. 522, 458 S.E.2d 323 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ruling in
    Aster v. Gross
    , 7 Va. App. 1, 371 S.E.2d 833 (1988) did not establish that the negative impact of marital fault or other behavior could not be considered in light of the other factors, such as the couple's nonmonetary contributions, under subsection E of this section. Just as marital fault could be shown to have an economic impact on a marriage, i.e., waste or dissipation of assets, it can also be shown to have detracted from the marital partnership in other ways. Thus, as in the instant case, the trial court found not only that appellant made no nonmonetary contributions to the well-being of the family, but that his long-term infidelity and abusive behavior over the course of the marriage actually had a negative impact on the marital partnership. O'Loughlin v. O'Loughlin, 20 Va. App. 522, 458 S.E.2d 323 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fault is not a "wild card" that may be employed to justify what otherwise would be an arbitrary or punitive award. When fault is relevant in arriving at an award, the trial judge is required to consider it objectively, and how, if at all, it quantitatively affected the marital estate or well being of the family. O'Loughlin v. O'Loughlin, 20 Va. App. 522, 458 S.E.2d 323 (1995).

        Although IRA account was opened by wife prior to marriage and $4,000 of account was wife's separate property, trial court did not err in awarding husband fifty percent of account, where remaining balance of $17,935 consisted of funds retraceable as marital property since funds had been earned and contributed by wife during marriage.

        While the parties' marriage did not remain harmonious, the record did not prove that one spouse's alleged misconduct met the standard for the cruelty fault ground as there were actions on the part of both parties consisting of angry words, annoyances, and failure to maintain the marital relationship, but the trial court did not find that sufficient to show cruelty. Therefore, cruelty was not considered in the equitable distribution of assets. Delanoy v. Delanoy,, 2014

        The statutory directive in subdivision E 5, "specifically including any ground for divorce . . .," does not limit consideration to grounds for divorce. Therefore it was proper for the trial court to consider evidence of the husband's adultery, provided it contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, when making an equitable distribution award. Cousins v. Cousins, 5 Va. App. 156, 360 S.E.2d 882 (1987).

        The circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, specifically including any ground for divorce, are among the factors to be considered in determining the amount of the award. The statute authorizes the commissioner and the trial judge to weigh these circumstances as a factor in arriving at the amount of the monetary award. Westbrook v. Westbrook, 5 Va.

         Premarital agreement.

        - Trial court erred in awarding a former wife 50 percent of the equity in jointly titled real property, because it did not consider evidence of the former husband's exclusive contributions to its acquisition, and the parties' pre-marital agreement provided that all income was the separate property of the party who earned it. As the funds in an account came from a former husband's income, which, under the terms of the parties' pre-marital agreement, was to be treated as his separate property. Parsons v. Parsons,, 2012

         Husband entitled to award despite criminal activity.
        </b>
        - Although final decree recited that husband's "criminal activity ... led up to the parties' separation," no evidence tended to prove that the husband's criminal activity or conviction had any effect upon the value of the real estate or mobile home or had a negative economic impact upon the marital estate. In the absence of any such evidence, the trial judge erred in determining that the husband had no rights or equity in the marital property and was not entitled under subsection E to an equitable award for his share of the marital assets.

        - Wife was awarded 25 percent of her husband's military retirement pay as the parties were married for 13 years, with long absences and brief periods together, the wife had health concerns due to her weight, and the wife's weight was the cause of the husband's dissatisfaction with the marriage.

        - Where the parties' experts each failed to properly credit the husband's medical practice with its intrinsic value, and where neither party set a value for the practice's industrial goodwill, the parties failed to meet their burden of providing the court with evidence of the practice's intrinsic value. The court was forced to calculate an intrinsic value for the husband's practice without including any goodwill value for the business; the court then divided that value evenly between the parties since that was what the parties agreed to in a stipulation.

         Valuation of law practice.
        </b>
        - In a divorce between parties who had a 33-year marriage, in which both of them had contributed equally to the family's welfare, the value of the husband's interest in his two-partner law firm was determined when the court took half the value of the assets that the firm had reported on a recent tax return because none of the normal indicia of a firm's value had been introduced, including evidence of the value of the firm's material assets, its prior earning record, its accounts receivable or accounts payable, or any debt that it may have acquired. The value of the $250,000 life insurance policy that the firm held on the husband's life was not determinative of the value of his interest in the firm, although it was some minor evidence of said value.

        - Husband created, controlled, and managed an impressive real estate investment empire and he made all the monetary contributions for the well-being of the family; despite not being required to by the premarital agreement, he gave the wife joint ownership of a remarkable home worth $ 20 million and almost $ 1 million in jewelry.

       <p>
        Company and underling property was titled in the husband's name and was his separate property; the 2014 Joint Financial Statement, which nominally listed the company as a joint asset, did not accurately reflect the true ownership, as that statement focused on value, not legal title, and corporate records more accurately reported true ownership.

       <p>
        Based on the limited evidence on the issue, the court found a business formed April 23, 2014, long after the marriage began, and thus the husband had the burden of proving that the company was titled in his name to claim it as separate property; he had no evidence that a transfer to the wife never perfected, and thus the court found ownership in the company to be jointly titled to the husband and wife.

        A divorce court retains continuing jurisdiction, after a final decree of divorce has been entered, to modify its decree with respect to the maintenance of minor children, and this power to modify child support is not affected by the prior act of affirming, ratifying and incorporating into the divorce decree a child support agreement between the husband and wife.

        Because the best interest of the child is the paramount and guiding principle in setting child support, the need for court approval of agreements reached by the parties to modify the amount of support to be paid has neither been eliminated from the paradigm established for determination of child support, nor has it been subordinated to contract principles or public policy considerations in favor of the resolution of disputes by the parties themselves.

        - Trial court retains authority to modify child custody upon a material change in circumstance even after the parties reach a settlement agreement that is incorporated into a final decree of divorce; because the parties may not contract away the trial court's authority to change child custody when there is a material change in circumstances, every settlement agreement involving custody is implicitly made subject to those modifications.

        - Where the mother admitted that she had a long term sexual relationship with a man to whom she was not married; on four different occasions while her children were present, the man stayed overnight at her home for a weekend or more; and the children were aware the man was there and were aware that mother and the man slept together when he visited, the trial judge did not err in determining that there was not any change in circumstances that would cause a change in the legal custodial situation with the children. The trial judge prohibited the man from staying overnight until the couple married, but did not prohibit displays of affection between mother and the man, or contact between the children and the man.

        In a case in which a mother appealed the trial court's orders denying her motion to modify custody, and ordering that appellee father retain sole legal and physical custody of the parties' child, the mother unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred in finding that no material change in circumstances occurred since the court's custody order of January 13, 2005. The record supported that the child's mental and emotional well-being continued to improve under the current custody arrangement; testimony from three teachers who instructed the child in the intervening years indicated that she was bright, got along with her classmates, and did not have any behavioral issues, and the father's changes in marital status, employment, and residence did not constitute a change in circumstances that warranted a change in custody.

        - Trial court's order which, among other things, transferred custody of the parties' children to the mother, was proper under circumstances in which the trial court found that the father had an increasing tendency to exclude the mother from decision-making regarding the children, had failed to consistently and effectively consult with the mother about the children, and had refused to communicate with her except in writing; the trial court also found that the father had interfered with the mother's visitation and that, although the result of an investigation concluded that the allegations that the mother had sexually abused one of the children were unfounded, the father acted as if the allegations were true, and inappropriately took the child to a new therapist, without informing the mother.

        Although the intentional withholding of visitation of a child from the other parent without just cause could constitute a material change in circumstances justifying a change of custody in the discretion of the court, a court's authority to modify or revise a custody order could not be used merely to punish a parent; however, where a father consistently disregarded a custody order and intentionally withheld and/or interfered with the mother's time with the child, this supported an implicit finding of a material change in circumstances, which justified a modification of visitation.

        Trial court did not err in entering a custody and visitation decree even though it varied slightly from the terms of the oral agreement recited before the trial court; the determinative factor in a trial court's decision to alter visitation was whether it was in the best interests of the child to do so. The trial court modified the terms of the oral agreement at the request of the parties to clarify the calendar errors made in the agreement regarding Christmas, summer vacation, and the school-year weekends; the trial judge was clear that he thought it was in the best interests of the child not to alter visitation on Halloween, that the schedule was fair to the child, and that it benefited the child not to be on the road constantly.

"Where a party has demonstrated a material change in circumstance, the trial [judge] must determine whether that change justifies a modification in the support award by considering 'the present circumstances of both parties and the benefit of the children.' " Thus, an agreement or decree regarding child support can never permanently fix the amount of support. Kaplan v. Kaplan, 21 Va. App. 542, 466 S.E.2d 111 (1996).

        - Clearly, the trial court did not find that it was without jurisdiction to modify the husband's obligation to pay the private school tuition. Rather, the court evaluated the evidence presented and declined to make the modification sought by the husband. The court considered that, in previous litigation, it determined that private school was in the children's best interest, and also that the parties had consistently contracted for the husband to provide the tuition costs. The husband made no showing that private school was not still in the son's best interest. Therefore, the decision of the trial court was affirmed. Fricke v.

         An agreement by parties regarding the support of minor children
        </b>
        has a characteristic that is significantly different from contracts generally. When parties contract concerning their property, spousal support, and related aspects of their affairs and file the contract with the court before entry of the divorce decree, "no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary, shall be entered except in accordance with that ... contract." Unlike those contracts, any agreement that the parties reach regarding minor children may be modified by a judge "from time to time . . ., as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require." The issue of foreseeability of a change in condition, therefore, has significantly less impact in matters concerning child support. Kaplan v. Kaplan, 21 Va. App. 542, 466 S.E.2d 111 (1996).

Liability for support shall be determined retroactively for the period measured from the date that the proceeding was commenced by the filing of an action with any court provided the complainant exercised due diligence in the service of the respondent or, if earlier, the date an order of the Department of Social Services entered pursuant to Title 63.2 and directing payment of support was delivered to the sheriff or process server for service on the obligor.

        Trial court did not err in awarding child support retroactive to the date wife filed her initial pleadings because the trial court's order did not constitute a finding that the trial court had no jurisdiction over child support, but rather, it was simply a decision to decline to exercise jurisdiction over child support at that particular time; that order was no basis for saying the trial court had no jurisdiction over child support.

        Trial court erred in ordering that child support would be effective March 1, 2018, because this statute required that liability for child support be measured from the date the proceeding was commenced on February 19, 2015, which was the date the ex-husband filed a complaint for divorce, including a request for pendente lite relief; and the husband was liable for child support retroactively to that date; therefore, the trial court erred in failing to award to the ex-wife child support retroactive to February 19, 2015.

        Circuit court had before it a divorce proceeding requesting it to adjudicate support, filed January 30, 2018, and by granting wife's request to merge her dismissed petitions from another court into the matter before it, the circuit court did not effectively mean the case now originated with her filing petitions in the lower court.

        - Although a deviation from the presumptive amount of child support requires a trial court to "make written findings of enough detail and exactness to allow for effective appellate review of the findings," these findings may be incorporated in an order of the court prepared and submitted for approval by trial counsel.

        - In determining an appropriate contribution to the child's support the trial court is vested with discretionary power and its award will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.See also, Holloway v. Holloway, No. 1744-89-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 23, 1990); Rinaldi v. Dumsick, 32 Va. App. 330, 528 S.E.2d 134, 2000

        Trial court's determination of the husband's income of $21,188 per month was upheld on appeal; there were many complicating factors in this determination, ranging from the husband's claims of disability, the opinion of his expert that his depression would resolve shortly after trial, and the fact that he continued to receive payments from his employer in 2018 and 2019 in addition to disability payments. Although another fact-finder could have set the income at a different level, the trial court's decision was reasonable. Morrison v. Morrison, No. 1620-19-4, 2020

If the court finds that the obligor possesses assets that currently produce or must be liquidated and invested in order to produce income, the court should consider a deviation from the presumptive amount and determine how much asset income will be attributed to the parent in calculating his child support obligation.

        In a case where a husband's monthly child support obligation was reduced, but the trial court awarded his wife spousal support, the trial court found that a material change occurred in the husband's employment circumstances and that he was not voluntarily unemployed; however, the trial court found that he was voluntarily underemployed since: (1) after losing his job, he spent only two of the next 13 months searching full-time for employment befitting his qualifications; (2) he presented no evidence that he looked for suitable work during the initial two-month period when he was receiving unemployment benefits; (3) he admitted that the job he obtained as a car salesman did not permit him time to look for suitable work; (4) after leaving his car salesman job, he operated his own consulting company, rather than concentrating solely on looking for a job; and (5) although a witness for him testified that he lost his original job to down-sizing, the same witness testified that his former employer had hired other sales representatives after he left and that there were jobs out there.

       For purposes of application of the guideline, a basic child support obligation shall be computed using the schedule set out below. For combined monthly gross income amounts falling between amounts shown in the schedule, basic child support obligation amounts shall be extrapolated. However, unless one of the following exemptions applies where the sole custody child support obligation as computed pursuant to subdivision G 1 is less than the statutory minimum per month, there shall be a presumptive minimum child support obligation of the statutory minimum per month payable by the payor parent. If the gross income of the obligor is equal to or less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from time to time, then the court, upon hearing evidence that there is no ability to pay the presumptive statutory minimum, may set an obligation below the presumptive statutory minimum provided doing so does not create or reduce a support obligation to an amount which seriously impairs the custodial parent's ability to maintain minimal adequate housing and provide other basic necessities for the child. Exemptions from this presumptive minimum monthly child support obligation shall include: parents unable to pay child support because they lack sufficient assets from which to pay child support and who, in addition, are institutionalized in a psychiatric facility; are imprisoned for life with no chance of parole; are medically verified to be totally and permanently disabled with no evidence of potential for paying child support, including recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI); or are otherwise involuntarily unable to produce income.

The guidelines worksheet relied upon by the court or the Department of Social Services to compute a child support obligation for a support order issued by such court or the Department shall be placed in the court's file or the Department's file, and a copy of such guidelines worksheet shall be provided to the parties.

"Secondary employment income" includes but is not limited to income from an additional job, from self-employment, or from overtime employment. The cessation of such secondary income upon the payment of the arrearage shall not be the basis for a material change in circumstances upon which a modification of child support may be based.

The sole custody" for "Except in cases involving split custody or shared custody, a," added "Split custody support" to the beginning of subdivision G 2, rewrote subdivision G 3, which formerly read: "In cases involving shared custody, the amount of child support to be paid is the difference between the amounts owed by each parent to the other parent, with the parent owing the larger amount paying the difference to the other parent. To compute the monthly amount to be paid by one parent to the other parent, the following calculations shall be made," rewrote subdivision G 3 (a) which formerly read: "The 'basic child support obligation' of each parent shall be the 'total shared support' multiplied by the other parent's 'custody share.' The 'total shared support' of both parties equals statutory guideline amount determined pursuant to subsection B for the combined income of the parties and the number of shared children multiplied by 1.25. A parent's 'custody share' equals the number of days that parent has physical custody of a shared child per year divided by the number of days in the year," rewrote subdivision G 3 (b) which formerly read: "To each parent's 'basic child support obligation' shall be added the other parent's costs of health care coverage, to the extent allowable by subsection E, and the other parent's work-related child care costs to the extent allowable by subsection F," rewrote the first two sentences in subdivision G 3 (c) which formerly read: "The obligation of each parent to the other shall be then computed by multiplying each parent's percentage of the parents' monthly combined gross income by the support obligation obtained in subdivision G 3 (b).

         Agreement between parties does not bar court from exercising power.
        </b>
        - It is clear that parents cannot contract away their children's rights to support, nor can a court be precluded by agreement from exercising its power to decree child support; thus, the parties' agreement during the marriage that the wife would remain employed on a part-time basis could not substitute for the fact finder's analysis of the factors that must be considered when determining child support and the parties' respective obligations for its payment.

        Trial court's child support award was presumptively correct because it was based on the child support guidelines, and the balance was necessary for the husband to continue receiving a higher rate of interest that would produce $15,000 to $16,000 per year in interest income, which was the husband's primary income after he was essentially forced to sell his business.

        Circuit court correctly bookended the five different time periods of support with each child reaching the age of majority on the date that the period ended because Congress enacted the law that the amount of child support obligation as determined by the guidelines be a rebuttable presumption, which was adopted by the Virginia General Assembly; accordingly, a husband's arguments are devoid of merit, or comprehension, and wholly frivolous in their premise.

        Trial court erred in including the full monthly support amount when the obligor spouse had not been paying that amount and was not ordered to pay that amount under the purge plan.

        In cases in which the child support award begins and ends during the year or two before the child turns eighteen, the cost averaging assumption may be inequitable, and a pure guideline based award can be adjusted if it appears to be unjust or inappropriate; thus it is reasonable for a trial court to take into account a payee parent's testimony about the age related costs, and expenses naturally related to a child of that age can be taken into account when considering the standard of living factor.

        Father did not show that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a modified child support award because it accepted as credible the mother's testimony about the unique expenses associated with their son's activities during his last year of high school, and there was no evidence that the expenses were extravagant; the increased expenses would not be a recurring financial burden, and thus, the trial court imposed an award that, prospectively, would last only six months.

         Provision for support in separation agreement.

        - When awarding child support and presented with a provision for child support in a separation agreement, a trial court need not award child support in the statutorily presumptive amount if a deviation from such amount is justified. However, it must determine the guideline amount and then may compare this amount with the provisions of the separation agreement. Scott v. Scott, 12 Va. App. 1245, 408 S.E.2d 579 (1991).

         The starting point for determining the child support obligation of a party,

        whether initially or at a modification hearing, is to compute the presumptive amount using the schedule found in subsection B of this section. The presumptive amount is rebuttable, however, and the court may deviate from the presumptive amount if such amount is unjust or inappropriate.See also, Watkinson v. Henley, 13 Va. App. 151, 409 S.E.2d 470 (1991); Slonka v. Pennline, 17 Va. App. 662, 440 S.E.2d 423 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In setting a child support award, the trial judge must first compute the parties' gross incomes and then, by reference to the tables in subsection B of this section, must arrive at a presumptively correct award; if the trial judge deviates from the presumptive amount, the trial judge must explain why an award of the presumptive amount would be unjust and inappropriate. Lindsey v. Lindsey, No. 2249-92-4 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 29, 1994).

       <p>
        When a judge determines that a material change of circumstances has occurred in the children's needs or the parents' ability to pay and that a change in the amount of support is required, the initial step to determine how to modify the support award is to calculate the amount presumed to be correct according to the guidelines. Orlandi v. Orlandi, 23 Va. App. 21, 473 S.E.2d 716 (1996).

       </p>
       <p>
        As a matter of law, an increase in a payor's child support obligation by itself, due to a change in custody alone, cannot constitute the circumstances warranting the reduction of spousal support where the parties concede that the gross income of the payor spouse remains unchanged; it is inappropriate to premise a modification of spousal support on a reallocation of child support because subsection C of

        - To determine the degree to which the noncustodial spouse should share his or her prosperity with his children, a court must look both to the Code of Virginia and to traditional standards of reasonableness. In making an award, the guidelines set forth in this section should be viewed by the court as but one part of the equation, together with the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case, including the standard of living established for the family during the marriage.

        - The trial court did not err by applying the statutory child support guidelines retroactively; the guidelines are merely a procedural tool to aid the trial court in establishing a presumptively appropriate amount of child support; they do not affect the substantive rights of the parties; thus, because the statute is procedural and not substantive, it was not error to apply it retrospectively.

        - Trial court erred in making tabular computation on the basis of three children and then calculating father's obligation to the subject child as one-third of that amount. Support for only one child was at issue. That child was to be supported singly, not in conjunction with father's two legitimate children. The effect of the trial court's method was to impose on mother a support obligation with respect to father's two legitimate children. The computation should have been made on the basis of the one subject child, producing a presumptively correct support obligation. Johnson v. Daughtry, No. 0386-92-1 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 9, 1993).

        </b>
        - Under the definition of "gross income" it is clear that bonuses, stock grants, interest income, dividends and capital gains are to be included, as are gifts even though any type of gift is irregular income that may or may not extend into the future, including any inheritance whether by will or intestate succession.

        Despite the father's contention to the contrary in a divorce case where the father's child support obligation was calculated on remand, the trial court was not required to use a higher figure to impute income to the mother by including monetary assistance the mother received from the mother's parents. The mother and the mother's father testified that the assistance involved "loans," not "gifts," and under subsection C of

        Husband's income for purposes of child support had to include income from buying and selling real estate because there was no dispute that the husband had, before, during, and after the marriage, engaged in buying and selling houses; the husband's activities in that regard were, in fact, a recurring source of additional income; and the trial court erred in declining to include this income in calculating husband's income for purposes of child support; however, the trial court could credit the husband's testimony concerning the drop in his base salary with the university.

The fact that the husband, as sole shareholder of the corporation, and the law firm used firm assets for purposes other than paying the husband's salary and treated his earnings as a loan to the firm did not change the fact that husband had $58,000 earned income.

        - In determining a husband's child support obligation and his wife's gross income, a friend of the wife's down payment on a house that was his separate property did not constitute a gift to the wife; also, the wife explained that she and her friend considered the monies that he gave her over and above her salary were advances against her future commission from the sale of a power plant through her work, and the trial court did not err in concluding that the advances and payments were in the nature of loans, rather than gifts and commissions, as the husband claimed.

         Formula for determination of health care credit.
        </b>
        - The proper method of calculating child support payments, while crediting father with his actual payment of medical expenses, required the court to determine the child support payment pursuant to the guidelines contained in this section based upon the parties' income. Having reached that figure, additional allowable costs for child support and health care expenses should have been added. The total amount of child support expenses thus calculated then should have been divided into the parties' respective shares, based upon their income. Only at that point was it appropriate to credit father with the amount of health care expenses he pays. Watts v. Watts, No. 2426-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 29, 1994).

         Legitimate child care cost due to employment found.
        </b>
        - Although wife was unemployed, she was actively seeking new employment and interviewing for new positions. She presented credible evidence that she needed to continue to pay day-care costs to maintain the children's places in the facility. By maintaining day-care, she could accept any job offers immediately. Therefore, the child care cost was a legitimate one which was incurred due to employment. Newland v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly concluded that the entire $540 monthly preschool fee was necessary to cover the child's all-day care, and that wife's use of the word "tuition" rather than "work-related child-care costs," did not alter the essential character of the care the child received.

       <p>
        Ex-husband's child care cost of $530 was reasonable and necessary for his employment because, although the ex-wife was willing and available to care for the children after school during the husband's custodial weeks as well as her own, the trial court noted that the wife had an obligation to earn as much as she reasonably could in order to reduce her spousal support needs; and providing personal child care could inhibit her search for better employment.

        Because the current nanny had worked for the family for seven years, the wife left shortly after the nanny arrived in the morning and did not return until late afternoon, and the nanny supervised the children for two hours before getting them on the school bus in the morning and for three hours after school, the wife's requested child-care costs were reasonable and employment-related, and the parties' child-care needs were best served by continuing to employ the nanny.

         Day care expenses properly excluded from child support obligation.
        </b>
        - There was no error in the trial court's exclusion of day-care expenses from its child support calculation because the trial court found that the mere testimony of wife as to what her day-care expenses were for the child, without any further evidence, was insufficient proof of the appropriate amount of day-care expenses to be added to the basic child support obligation; simply because a statute requires inclusion of certain expenses in a child support award, it does not follow that the party seeking the inclusion of those expenses does not have the burden to produce sufficient credible evidence showing the appropriate amount of those expenses.

        - Father was ordered to pay $406 per month in child support in a split custody case because the primary residence of the two daughters was with the mother in Virginia and the primary residence of the son was with the father in Mississippi, the father had income of $60,000 per year, the mother had gross monthly income of $3,684, the mother had work-related daycare expense of $156 per month, the father had work-related daycare expense of $309 per month, and $200 per month was a reasonable visitation expense attributable to the father for child support purposes; there was no evidence that the son's special needs could have best been met in a private school and requiring the mother to contribute toward private school expenses was unjustified, the mother paid $146 per month for health insurance coverage on the children, and the presumptive amount of child support was $491 per month to be paid by the father to the mother. The court deviated from the presumptive amount by giving the father credit for $85 on account of the proportionate amount of his visitation travel expenses. Globus v. Globus,, 2002 Va. Cir.

        1972 amendment unconstitutional as applied to prior property settlement.
        
        - The wife's right to alimony did not depend alone upon the final decree of divorce. Instead, her right arose from a property settlement agreement approved and confirmed by the judge in the final divorce decree. Such an agreement created vested property rights in the parties by virtue of the judicial sanction and determination of the court; it was a final adjudication of the property rights of the parties. It could not be abrogated by subsequent legislative action found in the 1972 amendments to this section and

        Husband did not establish that the trial court erroneously applied the principle of the parental generosity rule when it modified the spousal support order and awarded the wife $3,500 per month because the record was replete with evidence indicating that the wife's resources were inadequate to enable her to maintain the standard of living she enjoyed during the parties' marriage. The wife had incurred significant expenses and liabilities during the interim between the termination of spousal support and her petition for spousal support, she had not been able to provide for her own retirement or maintain her standard of living, and, while the wife's income had admittedly increased somewhat during that time, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that her need was greater than the $1,500 per month awarded in 1998 - almost 10 years earlier.

        In a case in which an ex-husband argued on appeal that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to modify spousal support because he, through no fault of his own, experienced a significant reduction in income; and (2) finding that his ex-wife made a good faith effort to find employment, evidence supported the trial court's ruling that the ex-husband's change in income did not warrant a reduction in spousal support and that the ex-wife had made a good faith effort to obtain employment. While the ex-husband's change in income was a material change in circumstances and he appeared to have made prudent investment choices by investing in the stock market, the ex-husband also had to accept the risk of such an investment, and the trial court found that the ex-wife was becoming self-sufficient as a real estate agent prior to her cancer diagnosis and change in the real estate market.

         What is "reasonably foreseeable"
        </b>
        depends on the circumstances of the particular case; thus, when reviewing an appeal from a denial of an increase in support, the court looks to objective evidence available at the time of the previous award of support in order to assess what increases in expenses might reasonably have been expected. Furr v. Furr, 13 Va. App. 479, 413 S.E.2d 72 (1992).

       <p>
        The trial court was plainly wrong in holding that, in 1985, appellant should have foreseen the full array of increased expenses she had incurred since her last increase in support, and therefore, the trial court erred when it found no material change in circumstances. Furr v. Furr, 13 Va. App. 479, 413 S.E.2d 72 (1992).

       <p>
        Because support orders "may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding parties," a party can claim no prejudice when a trial judge rules that a change in circumstances has occurred even though that change might have been foreseen at an earlier time.

        Circuit court properly denied a husband's motion to amend spousal support because the husband failed to produce any direct evidence of his continuing ability to pay spousal support; the only significant change in circumstances was that fact that the children were all nine years older, and the circuit court appropriately weighed the evidence in determining that the change in circumstances did not warrant a modification in the spousal support award.

        Trial court did not err by not reducing the husband's spousal support obligation because, although the court accepted the husband's testimony concerning COVID-19-related slowdowns in the construction industry, it found that he did not make a full and fair disclosure about his finances, and, without such evidence, the court could not determine that the husband's income had declined; and the husband's evidence did not show that the wife's need for support decreased.

The wife testified that she had large medical bills and that her car needed expensive repairs; she was not employed at the time of the hearing, but had received workers' compensation benefits; she struggled to pay her rent and daily necessities; the husband had been employed with the railroad and been able to acquire a house, car, and furniture; and the husband recently retired, but still was able to meet his expenses, including his spousal support obligation.

        This section empowers a trial court to modify a spousal support award, but expressly limits the court's authority to modify an agreed upon spousal support award according to the terms of a stipulation or contract signed by the parties; divorcing spouses who are sui juris may bind themselves by contract to pay a specified amount of spousal support and may specify the extent to which a court may modify a spousal support award.

        Where a divorcing husband and wife had previously agreed by written stipulation to a sum of spousal support and the agreement has been incorporated into the final decree of divorce, the trial court does not have the authority to modify support, except as provided in the agreement.

        Trial court erred in refusing to order husband to pay wife one-half of his monthly pension payments where: (1) the parties entered a property settlement agreement (PSA) on the record, which was effective immediately and provided that the pension payments would be divided equally; (2) the trial court incorporated the PSA into the final divorce decree and the wife was vested with her interest in the pension; (3) the pendente lite payments to the wife were less than one-half of the pension payments; (4) the pendente lite order became inoperative upon the entry of the final decree; and (5) the provision for the wife to receive her share of the pension through a qualified domestic relations order was merely ministerial, was a procedural step to effect the division of the asset by the plan administrator, and was not a substantive term of the PSA.

        has a characteristic that is significantly different from contracts generally. When parties contract concerning their property, spousal support, and related aspects of their affairs and file the contract with the court before entry of the divorce decree, "no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary, shall be entered except in accordance with that . . . contract." Unlike those contracts, any agreement that the parties reach regarding minor children may be modified by a judge "from time to time . . ., as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require." The issue of foreseeability of a change in condition, therefore, has significantly less impact in matters concerning child support. Kaplan v. Kaplan, 21 Va. App. 542, 466 S.E.2d 111 (1996).

        Court did not err by denying the husband his request for all of his expenses incurred in the underlying litigation, because the property settlement agreement limited the award of all expenses incurred in enforcing the agreement against the defaulting party, and the court specifically found that the wife was not the defaulting party.

        the court had jurisdiction over the cause of action, spousal support, and the relief sought, modification of spousal support, as both parties filed notices requesting attorney's fees and introduced evidence pertaining to the same. While such action could not have conferred subject matter jurisdiction on the court, it could nonetheless serve as a waiver of any objection, as the parties would not be permitted to approbate and reprobate; an award of attorney's fees to the ex-wife was appropriate.

Based on the evidence, the ex-husband had proven by clear and convincing evidence that the ex-wife's relationship with her boyfriend constituted cohabitation in a situation analogous to a marriage since: (1) the ex-wife and her boyfriend shared a common residence; (2) they were involved in an intimate or romantic relationship; (3) both persons receive a substantial economic benefit from the living situation; (4) the ex-wife decorated the front room of the residence with family photographs, shared a master bathroom with her boyfriend, kept all of her toiletries in there, and exercised on the treadmill located in his bedroom; therefore, the husband's motion to terminate his spousal support obligation was granted.

The court then determined the effective date upon which the husband's monthly support award was to be reduced. Copperman v. Copperman,, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 62 (Roanoke County Apr. 7, 2006).

        Consent decree incorporating the parties' agreement not unilaterally modifiable.
        
        - Trial court's order imposing a spousal support obligation on one of the parties was a consent decree between the parties because the order was entered upon the agreement of the parties and one of the parties signed the order as "seen and agreed," which qualified as a stipulation or contract under subsection C of

         Reservation of right.
        </b>
        - Wife need not show a material change in circumstances to have her prayer for spousal support considered under the bargained-for reservation in the parties' property settlement agreement because she was not raising a modification of existing support but rather was bringing forth consideration of the authority which the court held back or reserved for consideration to another day to award additional support in derivation of the proceedings enacting the original final decree.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Reservations" are not subject to the requirement of a "material change in circumstances" extant for "modifications" of support since at the time a period of reservation is granted, the court does not reach the merits of a monetary award, which instead are considered later during the exercise of such reservation; the General Assembly never intended subsection (F) apply to an exercise of a granted reservation of support since it stands independent of initial support awarded, if any.

       </p>
       <p>
        Spousal support conferred in exercise of a "reservation" is not an "increase" of spousal support, but rather imposition of a new term of support; it makes no difference whether support was originally awarded to be followed by a reservation, or whether support is merely reserved for future consideration.

        factors when considering whether the former husband's petition for modification of spousal support should be granted; rather, the trial court was allowed to modify the amount of spousal support as the circumstances made proper, and a downward modification was warranted since the former husband had essentially retired when his business was acquired by another business, his retirement was at the normal age of 60, and he was living off of his investments, retirement savings, social security, and other forms of passive income.

        was granted because although the ex-husband took an early retirement and thereby his income was decreased, the retirement did not operate to the detriment of an ex-wife because she received pension payments as well as her share of the ex-husband's 401(k) account, which represented a substantial benefit.

         Need for increasing support not shown.
        </b>
        - Since an ex-wife, due to her employment and her inheritance, was enjoying a lifestyle at least commensurate with the lifestyle that she enjoyed while married, she had not demonstrated a need justifying an increase in spousal support; thus, the ex-wife's motion to modify spousal support was denied.

         Change must warrant modification.
        </b>
        - Although changed circumstances did occur during the intervening 18 years since the parties' divorce that affected them financially, there was no evidence that those changed circumstances warranted a change in spousal support since the husband earned more than he did at the time of the original order and the wife failed to show that she needed an increase in spousal support.

       </p>
       <p>
        Wife was entitled to a modification of spousal support; the increase took into account the somewhat questionable reduction in income of the wife as well as the increase in the cost for the wife to have the standard of living she agreed to in 1999 with spousal support of $3,000.00 per month.

         Modification not warranted.
        </b>
        - Though a court reduced an ex-husband's spousal support obligation by an amount representing the ex-wife's net monthly balance based on her current rate of income and alimony and amount that the ex-wife spent on her adult children each month, it refused to reduce the ex-husband's spousal support obligation by the amount that the ex-wife paid toward credit card debt each month and by the amount that the ex-husband contended that the ex-wife could save each month by adjusting the amount she withheld from her taxes. Perry v. Perry,, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 189 (Fairfax County Nov. 20, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former husband's motion to terminate spousal support was denied because although his loss of employment was involuntary and was a material change in circumstances, there was the ability to pay support from sources other than income from employment; relevant factors were the financial resources of the parties and their earning capacity, and the husband had more of both. Childress v. Childress, 88 Va. Cir. 403, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 51 (Henrico County July 3, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Monthly amount of support a husband owed a wife could not be modified under the parties' stipulation agreement because the agreement provided a contingency within the ten years when support could end, when the wife desired to remarry, but it did not expressly provide for the monthly amount to be subject to modification by a court.

       </p>
       <p>
        Husband was not entitled to a reduction in his spousal support obligation based on his reduced income due to his forced retirement for his acts rising to fault in the dissolution of marriage because (1) his lower income was the result of his own acts against plaintiff wife, and (2) he did not seek reconsideration of the court's finding of fault based on the negative employment impact of that finding. Jones v. Jones,, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 79 (Orange County Apr. 16, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband's motion for reduction in spousal support was not ripe for judicial consideration because the husband lost his job for cause, and he had ample time to inform the trial court of the impact of his involuntary retirement before it entered the final decree of divorce; the early involuntary retirement occurred because of the husband's misconduct and fault in causing the dissolution of the marriage. Jones v. Jones, 102 Va. Cir. 89, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1197 (Orange County Apr. 16, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former husband's retirement was not a material change in circumstances meriting modification of spousal support because the husband knew or should have known when the final decree was entered that the husband would be required to retire either because of the fault-based divorce or the employer's mandatory retirement age. Assuming a material change in circumstances, the financial needs of the wife who was struggling financially, while the husband who obtained a job, could still pay the amount of spousal support ordered, merited consideration.

        Husband's petition for modification of his spousal support obligation of $250 per month was granted, and his obligation was reduced to $200 per month, because his turning 70 years old, the mandatory retirement age, was a material change in circumstances, the marriage had only last three years, the husband had been paying support for 16 years, and the husband's monthly income was approximately 2.85 times that of the wife's income.

        1972 amendment unconstitutional as applied to prior property settlement.
        
        - The wife's right to alimony did not depend alone upon the final decree of divorce. Instead, her right arose from a property settlement agreement approved and confirmed by the judge in the final divorce decree. Such an agreement creates vested property rights in the parties by virtue of the judicial sanction and determination of the court; it was a final adjudication of the property rights of the parties. It could not be abrogated by subsequent legislative action found in the 1972 amendments to

         Use of contempt power.

        - This section allows the court to incorporate by reference in a divorce decree an agreement between the parties. In order to encourage the voluntary settlement of property, custody and support matters and, further, to facilitate the enforcement of the agreement, the court may use its contempt power on any of the contract provisions.

        Finding of contempt was proper where a separation agreement provided that a portion of the husband's retirement pay be payable to the wife, the court found that the husband had notice of the arrearages, and was willfully violating the terms of the separation agreement, and as a result, the wife suffered a pecuniary loss.

       <p>
        When the terms of a disputed provision in a marital property settlement agreement are clear and definite, it is axiomatic that they are to be applied according to their ordinary meaning; where there is no ambiguity in the terms of a contract, the court must construe it as written and not search for the meaning beyond the pertinent instrument itself.

        - No valid agreement existed between the parties where they, with counsel present, entered into settlement discussions and, upon concluding, dictated a "Transcript of Statement" which was typed and placed in the court file, and one of the provisions in the transcript stated that the agreement would be reduced to writing and executed by the parties. When contracting parties intend to reduce their oral agreement to writing, a presumption arises that no final contract has been entered into.

         Incorporation not prerequisite to enforceability between parties.
        </b>
        - Incorporation of a property settlement agreement into a divorce decree does nothing more than allow the court to enforce the contract through its contempt powers pursuant to this section. It is not a prerequisite to the binding effect of the contract as between the two parties. Parra v. Parra, 1 Va. App. 118, 336 S.E.2d 157 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if not incorporated into a divorce decree, it is clear that a marital settlement agreement is still enforceable as a contract, as it has been recognized in Virginia that marital property settlements entered into by competent parties upon valid consideration for lawful purposes are favored in the law and such will be enforced unless their illegality is clear and certain.

         Approval of contract in decree differs from incorporation thereof.
        </b>
        - The effect of a divorce decree that approves a contract between the parties without specifically incorporating the contract or ordering the husband to perform its obligations differs from divorce decree that specifically incorporates the contract or orders the husband to perform its obligations. In the former, the decree is an approval of a private contract and may not be enforced in the divorce suit, whereas in the latter situation, the court may enforce the agreement through its contempt powers.

       <p>
        The language of the divorce decree which "approved, ratified and confirmed" the settlement agreement did not have the same effect as the language of this section, which provides that a court may "affirm, ratify and incorporate" an agreement. The former merely approves the agreement of the parties while the latter makes the agreement a part of the divorce decree and enforceable as such. Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, 1 Va.

        Period for which there may be retroactive modification of support order.

       - By enacting this section, the legislature specifically addressed and provided for retroactive modification of spousal support orders when proceedings are reopened to increase, decrease or terminate maintenance and support for a spouse or for a child, but only with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, and only from the date that notice of a pending petition for modification has been given to the responding party.

        Where this section provides that "no support order may be retroactively modified,
       </b>
       but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification," there was no evidence that the parties agreed that father would no longer make child support payments, and where the agreement to pay $100 per month in child support was expressly set out in the final divorce decree, even though the children had been living with father for over a year at the time the decree was entered, then no relief to father could be given.

       <b>
        Child support not retroactively modified.
       </b>
       - Because the circuit court lacked in personam jurisdiction at the time it entered the divorce decree, the order of child support was a complete nullity and was void from the time of entry; consequently, the circuit court could not, and did not, retroactively modify child support.

        Finality of support orders.

        Reconsideration of award of pendente lite support.
       </b>
       - Statute does not apply to motions to reconsider an award of pendente lite spousal support in a pending case; a pendente lite order is not final, it is subject to modification while the circuit court retains jurisdiction over the case, and if a pendente lite award is still in effect and subject to modification, "the proceedings" are open and ongoing.

      <p>
       <b>
        Suspension of support payments based on changed circumstances.
       </b>
       - Because the trial court had the authority to suspend a husband's payments during the period pending its ruling on modification, as well as to require him to make these payments pending its decision, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the modification reducing the amount of support.

        Retroactive modification allowed because of fraud.
       </b>
       - Retroactive adjustment of temporary child and spousal support awards to wife were warranted, even though retroactive modification appeared at first glance to be forbidden by statute, as husband's commission of an intrinsic fraud on the court by, inter alia, underreporting his annual income, providing income tax returns that did not contain reliable information, and reporting unrealistic figures, authorized the trial court to retroactively adjust those awards to prevent a manifest injustice from occurring, especially since the evidence viewed without the fraud showed that the husband had an ability to pay increased support.

The artwork was awarded to the husband, but when the wife lost it, the husband claimed contempt. While the court did not assign a specific value to the painting, it was clear from the court's total award that the court estimated its worth at approximately $5,000. Husband presented evidence that he incurred $5,600 in costs and $6,144.50 in attorney's fees in connection with the contempt hearing. The fees of the expert and of husband's counsel were reasonable and were directly related to the wife's contempt, and thus their award was proper. Theismann v.

A divorce could not be granted on the uncorroborated testimony of the parties or either of them and the husband failed to provide corroborating evidence of his grounds for divorce; rather, the record established that the parties lived separate and apart for one year prior to the filing of wife's complaint for divorce.

Because both parties were at fault, the only ground for divorce was their separation, and the trial court properly refused to grant either party a divorce based upon fault, but granted the divorce on the ground that the parties had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation or interruption for one year.

        Applicability of Rule
       </b>
       1:1. - When a court exercises its discretion to seal a file, it is not making a decision on the merits of the underlying case; therefore, Rule 1:1 does not apply. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Jurisdiction.
       </b>
       - Statute grants a court discretion to seal a file in domestic cases and contains no deadline; the court had jurisdiction in this case to seal the file. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction.
       </b>
       - While a presumption of openness exists, the General Assembly has granted judges the authority to seal in domestic relations cases but discretion does not extend to all domestic relations matters, as the statute on sealing records expressly refers to the chapter dealing with divorce, affirmation, and annulment, and therefore excludes the chapter dealing with custody and visitation. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the court has clear discretion to seal divorce records, some circumstances will be present where divorce record sealing will cause the ancillary sealing of some related custody and visitation records; this must be balanced on a case-by-case basis. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).

       <b>
        Presumption for keeping records open.
       </b>
       - Recognizing the strong constitutional and statutory presumption of open files, when a court does seal all or part of the file the reasons for doing so should itself be open and public; rarely should the sealing of the file include sealing the very reasons for doing so. Otherwise, the public is unable to determine whether the decision to seal was a reasonable one. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Standard of review.
       </b>
       - Standard of review in a record sealing case is abuse of discretion in the face of the strong presumption of openness. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Factors.
       </b>
       - Considerations against sealing include: agreement by or desire of the litigants to seal, an unparticularized concern of damage to professional reputation, emotional damage, or financial harm, public figure status, publicity surrounding the case, and malicious use of court records. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors a court may want to consider when assessing whether sealing a file is appropriate include: particularized proof of harm, privileged materials, personally identifiable information, trade secrets, when the material has little relevance to the case, the protection of children, and demonstrably false information. No one factor is dispositive, and no specific combination of these factors should control a decision to seal a file in every case. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Record sealed in part.
       </b>
       - After considering the various record-sealing factors the court determined needed review, the court sealed the record in part; the complaint was an orphaned pleading, there were no rulings on the merits, the husband introduced credible evidence that the fully open file had caused actual, particularized harm, including loss of clients and professional recognition, and the court doubted the veracity of at least some of the allegations. The presumption against sealing was rebutted. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Discretionary authority.
       </b>
       - Both the open records law and the expungement law grant the circuit court discretionary authority to close records using the permissive word "may" but judicial records are presumed to be open, persons are presumed innocent, and those who have their cases dismissed thereafter occupy the status of innocent; thus, the presumption against sealing can be lifted when a party points to a real harm that has occurred as opposed to a theoretical, to-be-determined harm. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sequestration denied.
       </b>
       - In a divorce action, the husband, a prominent attorney, was not entitled to sequestration of the file because the information that he sought to have sealed, involving the circumstances associated with the wife's arrest and allegedly false claims against the husband, were already in the public domain, and there was a strong interest in open judicial records. Burchfield v. Burchfield, 103 Va. Cir. 447, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 3279 (Fairfax County Feb. 20, 2018).

       - In a child custody case, grandparents generally came before a court merely as a person with a legitimate interest, however, since the father and grandfather's agreement for joint legal custody and for the grandfather to have primary physical custody was the subject of a court's consent order, the grandfather's status of custodian gave him precisely the same child-rearing autonomy as that enjoyed by the parent in the hearing to modify that order.

       Trial court did not err in applying a best interest of the child standard and in determining custody should be awarded to a nonparent, the paternal grandmother; even though the law presumed that granting custody to a parent was best, the evidence showed that there was "extraordinary reason" to award custody to the paternal grandmother given the father's instability, his violent behavior, his inability to put his minor child's needs ahead of his own, and the paternal grandmother's legitimate interest in raising the minor child.

        Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any school staff to interpret or enforce the terms of such custody or visitation order.

       Because the trial court had the authority to rule on matters of custody and visitation, if the court erred by allowing the Department of Social Services to dictate the parameters of visitation, that decision simply would have been reversible error; it did not render the order void ab initio. Because the visitation order from October 2012 was not void ab initio, the doctrine of res judicata applied as the mother asserted the same argument that she previously raised against father before the appellate court in 2013.

       - Mother's motion to amend custody and visitation of the children was properly denied because the trial court had reason to require an independent psychological evaluation of mother's mental health before determining if a change of custody or visitation was in the children's best interests; the mother incorrectly asserted that her due process constitutional right to a prompt adjudication was superior to the trial court's rights to appoint a mental health evaluator as the children's welfare, not the mother's due process right to a prompt trial, was the paramount concern; and the mother had the opportunity for a hearing and a ruling on her motion after she obtained the evaluation, but she chose not to undergo an evaluation, and rested her case.

For the constitutional requirement to be satisfied, before visitation can be ordered over the objection of the child's parents, a court must find actual harm to the child's health or welfare without such visitation.

The trial court modified the terms of the oral agreement at the request of the parties to clarify the calendar errors made in the agreement regarding Christmas, summer vacation, and the school-year weekends; the trial judge was clear that he thought it was in the best interests of the child not to alter visitation on Halloween, that the schedule was fair to the child, and that it benefited the child not to be on the road constantly.

       - Court awarded joint custody of a daughter to the daughter's father and the father's sister, who cared for the daughter while the father was hospitalized for diabetes. The presumption in favor of awarding custody to a parent rather than a nonparent had been rebutted by showing that mother was unfit as parent, had an extensive criminal record, a history of intoxication in front of the child, and had involved the daughter in criminal activities.

        Standard for determining visitation rights.

       - Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia, holds that the appropriate standard for determining visitation rights of a fit nonparent with a minor child, over the objection of a fit custodial parent and the silence of a noncustodial parent, is whether the minor child would suffer actual harm without visitation by the nonparent and, if so, whether nonparent visitation is in the best interests of the child.

        - In a case in which a mother appealed the trial court's orders denying her motion to modify custody, and ordering that appellee father retain sole legal and physical custody of the parties' child, the mother unsuccessfully argued that the trial court failed to adequately communicate the basis of its decision, either orally or in writing, for its finding that no material change in circumstances had been proven, as required by

        </cite>

        , the relocation issue was in fact moot since the judge presumed that the mother's relocation, which was necessitated by her military transfer, was inevitable. As the judge had previously ruled that the mother should receive custody, a separate decision on relocation was unnecessary; therefore, the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to hear the father's appeal. de Haan v. de Haan, 54 Va.

        Child custody decisions are not decided on the basis of bright line rules; they are decided by applying the best interests standard to the facts in individual cases and such is not amenable to the creation of hard and fast rules.

        Trial court's order which, among other things, transferred custody of the parties' children to the mother, was proper under circumstances in which the trial court found that the father had an increasing tendency to exclude the mother from decision-making regarding the children, had failed to consistently and effectively consult with the mother about the children, and had refused to communicate with her except in writing; the trial court also found that the father had interfered with the mother's visitation and that, although the result of an investigation concluded that the allegations that the mother had sexually abused one of the children were unfounded, the father acted as if the allegations were true, and inappropriately took the child to a new therapist, without informing the mother.

The parties' nannies also indicated that the wife's house was better stocked with food and clothing suitable for the children's needs and that wife maintained more structure for the children, since the husband often brought the children to school late and had irregular hours since he worked from the home.

        Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that it was in the children's best interests to award sole custody to the mother and deny visitation to the father because the father subjected the mother and their children to family abuse, which ultimately led to his conviction for a crime of violence against the mother and a 50-year prison sentence; and the mother was the parent who was most concerned about the children's emotional wellbeing, and the father was out of touch with the trauma and emotional damage he caused the children.

        - Trial court's award of custody to the wife in a divorce action was reversed and remanded for further consideration where the record was devoid of any evidence to support the trial court's statement that the child slept with the primary caretaker, which the appellate court assumed referred to the wife; the appellate court was unable to conclude that the error was harmless, in light of the fact that the trial court decided not to follow the commissioner's recommendation to award primary custody to the husband and in light of the fact that the sleeping factor was one of the primary factors that the trial court relied upon in awarding custody to the wife.

        Trial court properly determined that it was in the children's best interests to award joint legal custody and primary physical custody to their respective fathers because it analyzed each of the statutory factors, there was no indication that it relied on the doctrine of unclean hands, a mother did not timely object to testimony or argument about the mold in her home, and her opening briefs did not contain any principles of law or citation to legal authorities to fully develop her arguments.

        - The recommendation of the guardian ad litem in instant child custody case, while not binding or controlling, should not be disregarded. The duty of a guardian ad litem in a child custody dispute is to see that the interest of the child is represented and protected. This child had no other independent participant in the proceeding, aside from the trial court, to protect his interests. Thus, this diligent guardian ad litem's recommendation that custody be awarded to the grandmother was entitled to be considered by the court in reaching a decision on the issue. Bottoms v. Bottoms,

        - In Virginia, the law is clear that the best interests of the children control the issue of a custodial parent moving the children to another state, and the court may consider a benefit to the parent from such a relocation only if the move independently benefits the children; the "unity of interest" analysis, under which the interests of the children cannot be divorced from those of their primary caregiver, is not applicable under Virginia law.

Moreover, the trial court granted the husband four weeks of visitation in Virginia each year and ordered the wife to pay the costs of transporting the sons there. Judd v. Judd, 53 Va.

The court found that the father disobeyed a pendente lite order by having his girlfriend stay overnight at the marital home while the child was present and made unilateral decisions about the child; whereas the mother appeared to be a good caretaker for the child and spent as much time with the child as she possibly could, even though the child lived primarily with the father, and the decisions that the mother made with respect to the welfare of the child attested to her judgment skills.

        Access to medical records denied.

       - Circuit court properly granted a mother's motion to deny a father access to their child's medical records, finding that the father's claim of error on appeal was procedurally barred pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18; moreover, even if the claim was properly preserved, the father was not in a position to make any decisions regarding the child's medical care and treatment, and based on the evidence presented by the mother, the circuit court judge could properly conclude that had the father had access to said records, he would have used them in a manner inconsistent with the child's best interest, in order to twist the truth, and to only serve his own purposes.

       - Mental health records of a therapist who treated a child were precluded from production in a custody matter involving the child because only statutory requirement was for the therapist to allow a second physician or clinical psychologist of equivalent credentials to review the files to give a second opinion. The therapist did exactly what was required by statute of the therapist, but the child's parent who requested the records declined to pursue the available route. Sherfey v. Cushing, 103 Va.

For purposes of this hearing, the nondeploying parent or guardian shall bear the burden of showing that reentry of the custody or visitation order in effect before the deployment is no longer in the child's best interests.

       et seq., England was not the children's "home state" because "state" was defined as "any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia." Nevertheless, the court gave the chapter a liberal interpretation in order to accomplish its general purposes. The English procedural and substantive law of child custody is reasonably comparable to the law of Virginia. Consequently, because of the statutory mandate that the general policies of this chapter extend to the international area, the court treated England as the equivalent of a statutory "home state" under the forum non conveniens provisions of the chapter.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       The UCCJA did not contain a definition of "child."
       The definition here is taken from the PKPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "child-custody determination" now closely tracks the PKPA definition.
       It encompasses any judgment, decree or other order which provides for the custody of, or visitation with, a child, regardless of local terminology, including such labels as "managing conservatorship" or "parenting plan."
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "child-custody proceeding" has been expanded from the comparable definition in the UCCJA.
       These listed proceedings have generally been determined to be the type of proceeding to which the UCCJA and PKPA are applicable.
       The list of examples removes any controversy about the types of proceedings where a custody determination can occur. Proceedings that affect access to the child are subject to this Act.
       The inclusion of proceedings related to protection from domestic violence is necessary because in some States domestic violence proceedings may affect custody of and visitation with a child.
       Juvenile delinquency or proceedings to confer contractual rights are not "custody proceedings" because they do not relate to civil aspects of access to a child.
       While a determination of paternity is covered under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the custody and visitation aspects of paternity cases are custody proceedings.
       Cases involving the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction have not been included at this point because custody of the child is not determined in a proceeding under the International Child Abductions Remedies Act.
       Those proceedings are specially included in the Article 3 enforcement process.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Commencement" has been included in the definitions as a replacement for the term "pending" found in the UCCJA.
       Its inclusion simplifies some of the simultaneous proceedings provisions of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "home State" has been reworded slightly. No substantive change is intended from the UCCJA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "issuing State" is borrowed from UIFSA.
       In UIFSA, it refers to the court that issued the support or parentage order.
       Here, it refers to the State, or the court, which made the custody determination that is sought to be enforced.
       It is used primarily in Article 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "person" has been added to ensure that the provisions of this Act apply when the State is the moving party in a custody proceeding or has legal custody of a child.
       The definition of "person" is the one that is mandated for all Uniform Acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "person acting as a parent" has been slightly redefined.
       It has been broadened from the definition in the UCCJA to include a person who has acted as a parent for a significant period of time prior to the filing of the custody proceeding as well as a person who currently has physical custody of the child.
       In addition, a person acting as a parent must either have legal custody or claim a right to legal custody under the law of this State.
       The reference to the law of this State means that a court determines the issue of whether someone is a "person acting as a parent" under its own law.
       This reaffirms the traditional view that a court in a child custody case applies its own substantive law.
       The court does not have to undertake a choice-of-law analysis to determine whether the individual who is claiming to be a person acting as a parent has standing to seek custody of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "tribe" is the one mandated for use in Uniform Acts.
       Should a State choose to apply this Act to tribal adjudications, this definition should be enacted as well as the entirety of Section 104.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "contestant" as has been omitted from this revision.
       It was defined in the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       2(1) as "a person, including a parent, who claims a right to custody or visitation rights with respect to a child."
       It seems to have served little purpose over the years, and whatever function it once had has been subsumed by state laws on who has standing to seek custody of or visitation with a child.
       In addition UCCJA
       <span class="s1">

       Two proceedings are governed by other acts.
       Adoption cases are excluded from this Act because adoption is a specialized area which is thoroughly covered by the Uniform Adoption Act (UAA) (1994).
       Most States either will adopt that Act or will adopt the jurisdictional provisions of that Act.
       Therefore the jurisdictional provisions governing adoption proceeding are generally found elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are likely to be a number of instances where it will be necessary to apply this Act in an adoption proceeding.
       For example, if a State adopts the UAA then Section 3-101 of the Act specifically refers in places to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act which will become a reference to this Act.
       Second, the UAA requires that if an adoption is denied or set aside, the court is to determine the child's custody. UAA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       3-704.
       Those custody proceedings would be subject to this Act.
       See Joan Heifetz Hollinger, The Uniform Adoption Act:
       Reporter's Ruminations, 30 Fam.L.Q. 345 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Children that are the subject of interstate placements for adoption or foster care are governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC).
       The UAA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       2-107 provides that the provisions of the compact, although not jurisdictional, supply the governing rules for all children who are subject to it.
       As stated in the Comments to that section:
       "Once a court exercises jurisdiction, the ICPC helps determine the legality of an interstate placement." For a discussion of the relationship between the UCCJA and the ICPC see J.D.S. v. Franks, 893 P.2d 732 (Ariz. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings pertaining to the authorization of emergency medical care for children are outside the scope of this Act since they are not custody determinations.
       All States have procedures which allow the State to temporarily supersede parental authority for purposes of emergency medical procedures.
       Those provisions will govern without regard to this Act.

       This section allows States the discretion to extend the terms of this Act to Indian tribes by removing the brackets.
       The definition of "tribe" is found at Section 102(16).
       This Act does not purport to legislate custody jurisdiction for tribal courts.
       However, a Tribe could adopt this Act as enabling legislation by simply replacing references to "this State" with "this Tribe."

       Subsection (a) is not bracketed.
       If the Indian Child Welfare Act requires that a case be heard in tribal court, then its provisions determine jurisdiction.

       et seq., England was not the children's "home state" because "state" was defined as "any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia." Nevertheless, the court gave the chapter a liberal interpretation in order to accomplish its general purposes. The English procedural and substantive law of child custody is reasonably comparable to the law of Virginia. Consequently, because of the statutory mandate that the general policies of this chapter extend to the international area, the court treated England as the equivalent of a statutory "home state" under the forum non conveniens provisions of the chapter.

       The provisions of this Act have international application to child custody proceedings and determinations of other countries. Another country will be treated as if it were a State of the United States for purposes of applying Articles 1 and 2 of this Act. Custody determinations of other countries will be enforced if the facts of the case indicate that jurisdiction was in substantial compliance with the requirements of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this section, the term "child-custody determination" should be interpreted to include proceedings relating to custody or analogous institutions of the other country.
       See generally, Article 3 of The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court of this State may refuse to apply this Act when the child custody law of the other country violates basic principles relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
       The same concept is found in of the Section 20 of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (return of the child may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms).
       In applying subsection (c), the court's scrutiny should be on the child custody law of the foreign country and not on other aspects of the other legal system.
       This Act takes no position on what laws relating to child custody would violate fundamental freedoms.
       While the provision is a traditional one in international agreements, it is invoked only in the most egregious cases.

       The language change from "case" to "question" is intended to clarify that it is the jurisdictional issue which must be expedited and not the entire custody case.

       This section authorizes notice and proof of service to be made by any method allowed by either the State which issues the notice or the State where the notice is received.
       This eliminates the need to specify the type of notice in the Act and therefore the provisions of Section 5 of the UCCJA which specified how notice was to be accomplished were eliminated. The change reflects an approach in this Act to use local law to determine many procedural issues.
       Thus, service by facsimile is permissible if allowed by local rule in either State.
       In addition, where special service or notice rules are available for some procedures, in either jurisdiction, they could be utilized under this Act.
       For example, if a case involves domestic violence and the statute of either State would authorize notice to be served by a peace officer, such service could be used under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although Section 105 requires foreign countries to be treated as States for purposes of this Act, attorneys should be cautioned about service and notice in foreign countries. Countries have their own rules on service which must usually be followed.
       Attorneys should consult the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters, 20 U.S.T. 36, T.I.A.S. 6638 (1965).

       Court lacked personal jurisdiction over a spouse.
       
       - Trial court did not err in holding that it lacked in personam jurisdiction over a spouse who lived in a home in Belgium, despite personal service upon the spouse in Virginia, where the other spouse lived in Virginia because the spouse's return to Virginia was predicated upon a child custody hearing, and the spouse remained in Virginia after the hearing solely by reason of having been physically present for the purpose of participating in the proceeding.

       This section establishes a general principle that participation in a custody proceeding does not, by itself, give the court jurisdiction over any issue for which personal jurisdiction over the individual is required.
       The term "participate" should be read broadly.
       For example, if jurisdiction is proper under Article 2, a respondent in an original custody determination, or a party in a modification determination, should be able to request custody without this constituting the seeking of affirmative relief that would waive personal jurisdictional objections.
       Once jurisdiction is proper under Article 2, a party should not be placed in the dilemma of choosing between seeking custody or protecting a right not to be subject to a monetary judgment by a court with no other relationship to the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is comparable to the immunity provision of UIFSA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       314.
       A party who is otherwise not subject to personal jurisdiction can appear in a custody proceeding or an enforcement action without being subject to the general jurisdiction of the State by virtue of the appearance. However, if the petitioner would otherwise be subject to the jurisdiction of the State, appearing in a custody proceeding or filing an enforcement proceeding will not provide immunity.
       Thus, if the non-custodial parent moves from the State that decided the custody determination, that parent is still subject to the state's jurisdiction for enforcement of child support if the child or an individual obligee continues to reside there.
       See UIFSA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       205.
       If the non-custodial parent returns to enforce the visitation aspects of the custody determination, the State can utilize any appropriate means to collect the back-due child support.
       However, the situation is different if both parties move from State A after the determination, with the custodial parent and the child establishing a new home State in State B, and the non-custodial parent moving to State C.
       The non-custodial parent is not, at this point, subject to the jurisdiction of State B for monetary matters.
       See
    Kulko v. Superior Court
    , 436 U.S. 84 (1978).
       If the non-custodial parent comes into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the determination, the non-custodial parent is not subject to the jurisdiction of State B for those proceedings and issues requiring personal jurisdiction by filing the enforcement action.
      </p>
      <p>
       A party also is immune from service of process during the time in the State for an enforcement action except for those claims for which jurisdiction could be based on contacts other than mere physical presence.
       Thus, when the non-custodial parent comes into State B to enforce the visitation aspects of the decree, State B cannot acquire jurisdiction over the child support aspects of the decree by serving the non-custodial parent in the State.
       Cf. UIFSA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       611 (personally serving the obligor in the State of the residence of the obligee is not by itself a sufficient jurisdictional basis to authorize a modification of child support).
       However, a party who is in this State and subject to the jurisdiction of another State may be served with process to appear in that State, if allowable under the laws of that State.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Comments to UIFSA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       314 note, the immunity provided by this section is limited.
       It does not provide immunity for civil litigation unrelated to the enforcement action.
       For example, a party to an enforcement action is not immune from service regarding a claim that involves an automobile accident occurring while the party is in the State.

        Comment. -

       This section emphasizes the role of judicial communications. It authorizes a court to communicate concerning any proceeding arising under this Act.
       This includes communication with foreign tribunals and tribal courts.
       Communication can occur in many different ways such as by telephonic conference and by on-line or other electronic communication.
       The Act does not preclude any method of communication and recognizes that there will be increasing use of modern communication techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communication between courts is required under Sections 204, 206, and 306 and strongly suggested in applying Section 207. Apart from those sections, there may be less need under this Act for courts to communicate concerning jurisdiction due to the prioritization of home state jurisdiction.
       Communication is authorized, however, whenever the court finds it would be helpful.
       The court may authorize the parties to participate in the communication. However, the Act does not mandate participation.
       Communication between courts is often difficult to schedule and participation by the parties may be impractical.
       Phone calls often have to be made after-hours or whenever the schedules of judges allow.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does require that a record be made of the conversation and that the parties have access to that record in order to be informed of the content of the conversation. The only exception to this requirement is when the communication involves relatively inconsequential matters such as scheduling, calendars, and court records.
       Included within this latter type of communication would be matters of cooperation between courts under Section 112.
       A record includes notes or transcripts of a court reporter who listened to a conference call between the courts, an electronic recording of a telephone call, a memorandum or an electronic record of the communication between the courts, or a memorandum or an electronic record made by a court after the communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second sentence of subsection (b) protects the parties against unauthorized ex parte communications.
       The parties' participation in the communication may amount to a hearing if there is an opportunity to present facts and jurisdictional arguments.
       However, absent such an opportunity, the participation of the parties should not to be considered a substitute for a hearing and the parties must be given an opportunity to fairly and fully present facts and arguments on the jurisdictional issue before a determination is made.
       This may be done through a hearing or, if appropriate, by affidavit or memorandum.
       The court is expected to set forth the basis for its jurisdictional decision, including any court-to-court communication which may have been a factor in the decision.

       This section is the heart of judicial cooperation provision of this Act.
       It provides mechanisms for courts to cooperate with each other in order to decide cases in an efficient manner without causing undue expense to the parties.
       Courts may request assistance from courts of other States and may assist courts of other States.

       The provision on the assessment of costs for travel provided in the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       19 has been changed.
       The UCCJA provided that the costs may be assessed against the parties or the State or county.
       Assessment of costs against a government entity in a case where the government is not involved is inappropriate and therefore that provision has been removed.
       In addition, if the State is involved as a party, assessment of costs and expenses against the State must be authorized by other law. It should be noted that the term "expenses" means out-of-pocket costs.
       Overhead costs should not be assessed as expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       No other substantive changes have been made.
       The term "social study" as used in the UCCJA was replaced with the modern term: "custody evaluation."
       The Act does not take a position on the admissibility of a custody evaluation that was conducted in another State.
       It merely authorizes a court to seek assistance of, or render assistance to, a court of another State.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section provides mandatory jurisdictional rules for the original child custody proceeding.
       It generally continues the provisions of the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       3. However, there have been a number of changes to the jurisdictional bases.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t20c7.1a02s20-146.12-officialcommentol11">
        Home State Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the home State has been prioritized over other jurisdictional bases.  Section 3 of the UCCJA provided four independent and concurrent bases of jurisdiction.  The PKPA provides that full faith and credit can only be given to an initial custody determination of a "significant connection" State when there is no home State. This Act prioritizes home state jurisdiction in the same manner as the PKPA thereby eliminating any potential conflict between the two acts.
       </li>
       <li id="t20c7.1a02s20-146.12-officialcommentol12">
        Significant connection jurisdiction. This jurisdictional basis has been amended in four particulars from the UCCJA.  First, the "best interest" language of the UCCJA has been eliminated.  This phrase tended to create confusion between the jurisdictional issue and the substantive custody determination.  Since the language was not necessary for the jurisdictional issue, it has been removed.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The six-month extended home state provision of subsection (a)(1) has been modified slightly from the UCCJA.
       The UCCJA provided that home state jurisdiction continued for six months when the child had been removed by a person seeking the child's custody or for other reasons and a parent or a person acting as a parent continues to reside in the home State. Under this Act, it is no longer necessary to determine why the child has been removed.
       The only inquiry relates to the status of the person left behind.
       This change provides a slightly more refined home state standard than the UCCJA or the PKPA, which also requires a determination that the child has been removed "by a contestant or for other reasons." The scope of the PKPA's provision is theoretically narrower than this Act.
       However, the phrase "or for other reasons" covers most fact situations where the child is not in the home State and, therefore, the difference has no substantive effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       In another sense, the six-month extended home state jurisdiction provision is this Act is narrower than the comparable provision in the PKPA.
       The PKPA's definition of extended home State is more expansive because it applies whenever a "contestant" remains in the home State.
       That class of individuals has been eliminated in this Act.
       This Act retains the original UCCJA classification of "parent or person acting as parent" to define who must remain for a State to exercise the six-month extended home state jurisdiction.
       This eliminates the undesirable jurisdictional determinations which would occur as a result of differing state substantive laws on visitation involving grandparents and others.
       For example, if State A's law provided that grandparents could obtain visitation with a child after the death of one of the parents, then the grandparents, who would be considered "contestants" under the PKPA, could file a proceeding within six months after the remaining parent moved and have the case heard in State A.
       However, if State A did not provide that grandparents could seek visitation under such circumstances, the grandparents would not be considered "contestants" and State B where the child acquired a new home State would provide the only forum.
       This Act bases jurisdiction on the parent and child or person acting as a parent and child relationship without regard to grandparents or other potential seekers of custody or visitation.
       There is no conflict with the broader provision of the PKPA.
       The PKPA in
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       (c)(1) authorizes States to narrow the scope of their jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the UCCJA based jurisdiction on the presence of a significant connection between the child and the child's parents or the child and at least one contestant.
       This Act requires that the significant connections be between the child, the child's parents or the child and a person acting as a parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, a significant connection State may assume jurisdiction only when there is no home State or when the home State decides that the significant connection State would be a more appropriate forum under Section 207 or 208.
       Fourth, the determination of significant connections has been changed to eliminate the language of "present or future care."
       The jurisdictional determination should be made by determining whether there is sufficient evidence in the State for the court to make an informed custody determination.
       That evidence might relate to the past as well as to the "present or future."
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency jurisdiction has been moved to a separate section. This is to make it clear that the power to protect a child in crisis does not include the power to enter a permanent order for that child except as provided by that section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(3) provides for jurisdiction when all States with jurisdiction under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) determine that this State is a more appropriate forum.
       The determination would have to be made by all States with jurisdiction under subsection (a)(1) and (2).
       Jurisdiction would not exist under this paragraph because the home State determined it is a more appropriate place to hear the case if there is another State that could exercise significant connection jurisdiction under subsection (a)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (a)(4) retains the concept of jurisdiction by necessity as found in the UCCJA and in the PKPA.
       This default jurisdiction only occurs if no other State would have jurisdiction under subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (b) and (c) clearly State the relationship between jurisdiction under this Act and other forms of jurisdiction. Personal jurisdiction over, or the physical presence of, a parent or the child is neither necessary nor required under this Act.
       In other words neither minimum contacts nor service within the State is required for the court to have jurisdiction to make a custody determination.
       Further, the presence of minimum contacts or service within the State does not confer jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Subject to Section 204, satisfaction of the requirements of subsection (a) is mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements of this section, plus the notice and hearing provisions of the Act, are all that is necessary to satisfy due process.
       This Act, like the UCCJA and the PKPA is based on Justice Frankfurter's concurrence in
    May v. Anderson
    , 345 U.S. 528 (1953).
       As pointed out by Professor Bodenheimer, the reporter for the UCCJA, no "workable interstate custody law could be built around [Justice] Burton's plurality opinion . . . .
       Bridgette Bodenheimer, The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act:
       A Legislative Remedy for Children Caught in the Conflict of Laws, 22 Vand.L.Rev. 1207,1233 (1969).
       It should also be noted that since jurisdiction to make a child custody determination is subject matter jurisdiction, an agreement of the parties to confer jurisdiction on a court that would not otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act is ineffective.

        Initial custody jurisdiction does not provide continuing exclusive jurisdiction.

       - Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) has been superseded by the UCCJEA, a form of which has been adopted in Virginia, thereby changing prior Virginia law that provided that, once a Virginia court acquired jurisdiction over a custody or visitation matter, it retained jurisdiction to modify custody or visitation unless it expressly relinquished jurisdiction to another state. Under the UCCJEA, a Virginia court does not retain exclusive jurisdiction to modify a custody or visitation order simply because it entered the original order determining custody or visitation.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This is a new section addressing continuing jurisdiction. Continuing jurisdiction was not specifically addressed in the UCCJA .
       Its absence caused considerable confusion, particularly because the PKPA,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738(d), requires other States to give Full Faith and Credit to custody determinations made by the original decree State pursuant to the decree State's continuing jurisdiction so long as that State has jurisdiction under its own law and remains the residence of the child or any contestant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides the rules of continuing jurisdiction and borrows from UIFSA as well as recent UCCJA case law.
       The continuing jurisdiction of the original decree State is exclusive.
       It continues until one of two events occurs:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t20c7.1a02s20-146.13-officialcommentol11">
        If a parent or a person acting as a parent remains in the original decree State, continuing jurisdiction is lost when neither the child, the child and a parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent continue to have a significant connection with the original decree State and there is no longer substantial evidence concerning the child's care, protection, training and personal relations in that State.  In other words, even if the child has acquired a new home State, the original decree State retains exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, so long as the general requisites of the "substantial connection" jurisdiction provisions of Section 201 are met.  If the relationship between the child and the person remaining in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction becomes so attenuated that the court could no longer find significant connections and substantial evidence, jurisdiction would no longer exist.
       </li>
       <li id="t20c7.1a02s20-146.13-officialcommentol12">
        Continuing jurisdiction is lost when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent no longer reside in the original decree State.  The exact language of subparagraph (a)(2) was the subject of considerable debate. Ultimately the Conference settled on the phrase that "a court of this State or a court of another State determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this State" to determine when the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction of a State ended.  The phrase is meant to be identical in meaning to the language of the PKPA which provides that full faith and credit is to be given to custody determinations made by a State in the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction when that "State remains the residence of . . . ."  The phrase is also the equivalent of the language "continues to reside" which occurs in UIFSA § 205(a)(1) to determine the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction of the State that made a support order.  The phrase "remains the residence of" in the PKPA has been the subject of conflicting case law.  It is the intention of this Act that paragraph (a)(2) of this section means that the named persons no longer continue to actually live within the State.  Thus, unless a modification proceeding has been commenced, when the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents physically leave the State to live elsewhere, the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction ceases.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The use of the phrase "a court of this State" under subsection (a)(1) makes it clear that the original decree State is the sole determinant of whether jurisdiction continues.
       A party seeking to modify a custody determination must obtain an order from the original decree State stating that it no longer has jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase "do not presently reside" is not used in the sense of a technical domicile.
       The fact that the original determination State still considers one parent a domiciliary does not prevent it from losing exclusive, continuing jurisdiction after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have moved from the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents have all left the State which made the custody determination prior to the commencement of the modification proceeding, considerations of waste of resources dictate that a court in State B, as well as a court in State A, can decide that State A has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continuing jurisdiction provisions of this section are narrower than the comparable provisions of the PKPA.
       That statute authorizes continuing jurisdiction so long as any "contestant" remains in the original decree State and that State continues to have jurisdiction under its own law.
       This Act eliminates the contestant classification.
       The Conference decided that a remaining grandparent or other third party who claims a right to visitation, should not suffice to confer exclusive, continuing jurisdiction on the State that made the original custody determination after the departure of the child, the parents and any person acting as a parent.
       The significant connection to the original decree State must relate to the child, the child and a parent, or the child and a person acting as a parent.
       This revision does not present a conflict with the PKPA.
       The PKPA's reference in
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738(d) to
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738(c)(1) recognizes that States may narrow the class of cases that would be subject to exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
       However, during the transition from the UCCJA to this Act, some States may continue to base continuing jurisdiction on the continued presence of a contestant, such as a grandparent.
       The PKPA will require that such decisions be enforced.
       The problem will disappear as States adopt this Act to replace the UCCJA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a proceeding.
       If State A had jurisdiction under this section at the time a modification proceeding was commenced there, it would not be lost by all parties moving out of the State prior to the conclusion of proceeding.
       State B would not have jurisdiction to hear a modification unless State A decided that State B was more appropriate under Section 207.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusive, continuing jurisdiction is not reestablished if, after the child, the parents, and all persons acting as parents leave the State, the non-custodial parent returns.
       As subsection (b) provides, once a State has lost exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, it can modify its own determination only if it has jurisdiction under the standards of Section 201.
       If another State acquires exclusive continuing jurisdiction under this section, then its orders cannot be modified even if this State has once again become the home State of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       In accordance with the majority of UCCJA case law, the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction may relinquish jurisdiction when it determines that another State would be a more convenient forum under the principles of Section 207.

       It prohibits a court from modifying a custody determination made consistently with this Act by a court in another State unless a court of that State determines that it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 or that this State would be a more convenient forum under Section 207.
       The modification State is not authorized to determine that the original decree State has lost its jurisdiction.
       The only exception is when the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in the other State.
       In other words, a court of the modification State can determine that all parties have moved away from the original State.
       The court of the modification State must have jurisdiction under the standards of Section 201.

      <p>
       <b>
        Comment. -
       </b>
       The provisions of this section are an elaboration of what was formerly Section 3(a)(3) of the UCCJA.
       It remains, as Professor Bodenheimer's comments to that section noted, "an extraordinary jurisdiction reserved for extraordinary circumstances."
      </p>
      <p>
       This section codifies and clarifies several aspects of what has become common practice in emergency jurisdiction cases under the UCCJA and PKPA.
       First, a court may take jurisdiction to protect the child even though it can claim neither home State nor significant connection jurisdiction. Second, the duties of States to recognize, enforce and not modify a custody determination of another State do not take precedence over the need to enter a temporary emergency order to protect the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, a custody determination made under the emergency jurisdiction provisions of this section is a temporary order. The purpose of the order is to protect the child until the State that has jurisdiction under Sections 201-203 enters an order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under certain circumstances, however, subsection (b) provides that an emergency custody determination may become a final custody determination.
       If there is no existing custody determination, and no custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203, an emergency custody determination made under this section becomes a final determination, if it so provides, when the State that issues the order becomes the home State of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) is concerned with the temporary nature of the order when there exists a prior custody order that is entitled to be enforced under this Act or when a subsequent custody proceeding is filed in a State with jurisdiction under Sections 201- 203.
       Subsection (c) allows the temporary order to remain in effect only so long as is necessary for the person who obtained the determination under this section to present a case and obtain an order from the State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203.
       That time period must be specified in the order.
       If there is an existing order by a State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203, that order need not be reconfirmed.
       The temporary emergency determination would lapse by its own terms at the end of the specified period or when an order is obtained from the court with jurisdiction under Sections 202-203.
       The court with appropriate jurisdiction also may decide, under the provisions of 207, that the court that entered the emergency order is in a better position to address the safety of the person who obtained the emergency order, or the child, and decline jurisdiction under Section 207.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any hearing in the State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203 on the temporary emergency determination is subject to the provisions of Sections 111 and 112.
       These sections facilitate the presentation of testimony and evidence taken out of State.
       If there is a concern that the person obtaining the temporary emergency determination under this section would be in danger upon returning to the State with jurisdiction under Sections 201-203, these provisions should be used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) requires communication between the court of the State that is exercising jurisdiction under this section and the court of another State that is exercising jurisdiction under Sections 201-203.
       The pleading rules of Section 209 apply fully to determinations made under this section. Therefore, a person seeking a temporary emergency custody determination is required to inform the court pursuant to Section 209(d) of any proceeding concerning the child that has been commenced elsewhere.
       The person commencing the custody proceeding under Sections 201-203 is required under Section 209(a) to inform the court about the temporary emergency proceeding.
       These pleading requirements are to be strictly followed so that the courts are able to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Relationship to the PKPA.
       </b>
       The definition of emergency has been modified to harmonize it with the PKPA.
       The PKPA's definition of emergency jurisdiction does not use the term "neglect." It defines an emergency as "mistreatment or abuse." Therefore "neglect" has been eliminated as a basis for the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction.
       Neglect is so elastic a concept that it could justify taking emergency jurisdiction in a wide variety of cases.
       Under the PKPA, if a State exercised temporary emergency jurisdiction based on a finding that the child was neglected without a finding of mistreatment or abuse, the order would not be entitled to federal enforcement in other States.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Relationship to Protective Order Proceedings.
       </b>
       The UCCJA and the PKPA were enacted long before the advent of state procedures on the use of protective orders to alleviate problems of domestic violence.
       Issues of custody and visitation often arise within the context of protective order proceedings since the protective order is often invoked to keep one parent away from the other parent and the children when there is a threat of violence.
       This Act recognizes that a protective order proceeding will often be the procedural vehicle for invoking jurisdiction by authorizing a court to assume temporary emergency jurisdiction when the child's parent or sibling has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a protective order that contains a custody determination to be enforceable in another State it must comply with the provisions of this Act and the PKPA.
       Although the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), 18 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       2265, does provide an independent basis for the granting of full faith and credit to protective orders, it expressly excludes "custody" orders from the definition of "protective order," 18 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       2266.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many States authorize the issuance of protective orders in an emergency without notice and hearing.
       This Act does not address the propriety of that procedure.
       It is left to local law to determine the circumstances under which such an order could be issued, and the type of notice that is required, in a case without an interstate element.
       However, an order issued after the assumption of temporary emergency jurisdiction is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under this Act and the PKPA only if there has been notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard as set out in Section 205. Although VAWA does require that full faith and credit be accorded to ex parte protective orders if notice will be given and there will be a reasonable opportunity to be heard, it does not include a "custody" order within the definition of "protective order."
      </p>
      <p>
       VAWA does play an important role in determining whether an emergency exists.
       That Act requires a court to give full faith and credit to a protective order issued in another State if the order is made in accordance with the VAWA.
       This would include those findings of fact contained in the order.
       When a court is deciding whether an emergency exists under this section, it may not relitigate the existence of those factual findings.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section generally continues the notice provisions of the UCCJA.
       However, it does not attempt to dictate who is entitled to notice.
       Local rules vary with regard to persons entitled to seek custody of a child.
       Therefore, this section simply indicates that persons entitled to seek custody should receive notice but leaves the rest of the determination to local law.
       Parents whose parental rights have not been previously terminated and persons having physical custody of the child are specifically mentioned as persons who must be given notice.
       The PKPA,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738A(e), requires that they be given notice in order for the custody determination to be entitled to full faith and credit under that Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       State laws also vary with regard to whether a court has the power to issue an enforceable temporary custody order without notice and hearing in a case without any interstate element. Such temporary orders may be enforceable, as against due process objections, for a short period of time if issued as a protective order or a temporary restraining order to protect a child from harm.
       Whether such orders are enforceable locally is beyond the scope of this Act.
       Subsection (b) clearly provides that the validity of such orders and the enforceability of such orders is governed by the law which authorizes them and not by this Act.
       An order is entitled to interstate enforcement and nonmodification under this Act only if there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard.
       The PKPA,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738A(e), also requires that a custody determination is entitled to full faith and credit only if there has been notice and an opportunity to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules requiring joinder of people with an interest in the custody of and visitation with a child also vary widely throughout the country.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section represents the remnants of the simultaneous proceedings provision of the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       6.
       The problem of simultaneous proceedings is no longer a significant issue. Most of the problems have been resolved by the prioritization of home state jurisdiction under Section 201; the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction provisions of Section 202; and the prohibitions on modification of Section 203.
       If there is a home State, there can be no exercise of significant connection jurisdiction in an initial child custody determination and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings.
       If there is a State of exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, there cannot be another State with concurrent jurisdiction and, therefore, no simultaneous proceedings.
       Of course, the home State, as well as the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, could defer to another State under Section 207.
       However, that decision is left entirely to the home State or the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this Act, the simultaneous proceedings problem will arise only when there is no home State, no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction and more than one significant connection State.
       For those cases, this section retains the "first in time" rule of the UCCJA.
       Subsection (b) retains the UCCJA's policy favoring judicial communication.
       Communication between courts is required when it is determined that a proceeding has been commenced in another State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) concerns the problem of simultaneous proceedings in the State with modification jurisdiction and enforcement proceedings under Article 3.
       This section authorizes the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to stay the modification proceeding pending the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, to enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding, or to continue the modification proceeding under such conditions as it determines are appropriate.
       The court may wish to communicate with the enforcement court.
       However, communication is not mandatory. Although the enforcement State is required by the PKPA to enforce according to its terms a custody determination made consistently with the PKPA, that duty is subject to the decree being modified by a State with the power to do so under the PKPA.
       An order to enjoin the parties from enforcing the decree is the equivalent of a temporary modification by a State with the authority to do so.
       The concomitant provision addressed to the enforcement court is Section 306 of this Act.
       That section requires the enforcement court to communicate with the modification court in order to determine what action the modification court wishes the enforcement court to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "pending" that was utilized in the UCCJA section on simultaneous proceeding has been replaced.
       It has caused considerable confusion in the case law.
       It has been replaced with the term "commencement of the proceeding" as more accurately reflecting the policy behind this section.
       The latter term is defined in Section 102(5).

       While children's residence in California might merit a future determination that Virginia was an inconvenient forum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to make that determination prior to ruling on father's motion to show cause for violations of existing court orders.

       Trial court did not err in refusing to decline jurisdiction where Virginia was the child's home state by agreement, the parties had agreed to Virginia as the child's residence in anticipation of the child's one-year stay in Sweden, and the parties had formally agreed that they intended that Virginia be the only forum for adjudication of custody matters.

       The trial court properly declined to exercise further jurisdiction, where the custodial parent and the children had lived in Pennsylvania for more than two years, Pennsylvania had a closer connection with the children and the custodial parent, the children's contact with Virginia had been greatly attenuated for some time, and the most recent evidence concerning the children's care, protection, training, and personal relationships was in Pennsylvania.

      <p>
       The trial court did not err in declining sua sponte to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum where the child was born in Virginia, the father remained a resident of Virginia, the parties' action for divorce was proceeding in Virginia, and representations by the mother in her pleadings indicated that she was seeking to dismiss custody proceedings she initiated in Indiana.

      <p>

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section retains the focus of Section 7 of the UCCJA.
       It authorizes courts to decide that another State is in a better position to make the custody determination, taking into consideration the relative circumstances of the parties.
       If so, the court may defer to the other State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of factors that the court may consider has been updated from the UCCJA.
       The list is not meant to be exclusive.
       Several provisions require comment.
       Subparagraph (1) is concerned specifically with domestic violence and other matters affecting the health and safety of the parties.
       For this purpose, the court should determine whether the parties are located in different States because one party is a victim of domestic violence or child abuse.
       If domestic violence or child abuse has occurred, this factor authorizes the court to consider which State can best protect the victim from further violence or abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying subparagraph (3), courts should realize that distance concerns can be alleviated by applying the communication and cooperation provisions of Sections 111 and 112.
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying subsection (7) on expeditious resolution of the controversy, the court could consider the different procedural and evidentiary laws of the two States, as well as the flexibility of the court dockets.
       It also should consider the ability of a court to arrive at a solution to all the legal issues surrounding the family.
       If one State has jurisdiction to decide both the custody and support issues, it would be desirable to determine that State to be the most convenient forum.
       The same is true when children of the same family live in different States.
       It would be inappropriate to require parents to have custody proceedings in several States when one State could resolve the custody of all the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before determining whether to decline or retain jurisdiction, the court of this State may communicate, in accordance with Section 110, with a court of another State and exchange information pertinent to the assumption of jurisdiction by either court.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two departures from Section 7 of the UCCJA.
       First, the court may not simply dismiss the action.
       To do so would leave the case in limbo.
       Rather the court shall stay the case and direct the parties to file in the State that has been found to be the more convenient forum.
       The court is also authorized to impose any other conditions it considers appropriate.
       This might include the issuance of temporary custody orders during the time necessary to commence a proceeding in the designated State, dismissing the case if the custody proceeding is not commenced in the other State or resuming jurisdiction if a court of the other State refuses to take the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, UCCJA,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       7(g) which allowed the court to assess fees and costs if it was a clearly inappropriate court, has been eliminated.
       If a court has jurisdiction under this Act, it could not be a clearly inappropriate court.

       <b>
        Comment. -
       </b>
       The "Clean Hands" section of the UCCJA has been truncated in this Act.
       Since there is no longer a multiplicity of jurisdictions which could take cognizance of a child-custody proceeding, there is less of a concern that one parent will take the child to another jurisdiction in an attempt to find a more favorable forum.
       Most of the jurisdictional problems generated by abducting parents should be solved by the prioritization of home State in Section 201; the exclusive, continuing jurisdiction provisions of Section 202; and the ban on modification in Section 203.
       For example, if a parent takes the child from the home State and seeks an original custody determination elsewhere, the stay-at-home parent has six months to file a custody petition under the extended home state jurisdictional provision of Section 201, which will ensure that the case is retained in the home State.
       If a petitioner for a modification determination takes the child from the State that issued the original custody determination, another State cannot assume jurisdiction as long at the first State exercises exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, there are still a number of cases where parents, or their surrogates, act in a reprehensible manner, such as removing, secreting, retaining, or restraining the child. This section ensures that abducting parents will not receive an advantage for their unjustifiable conduct.
       If the conduct that creates the jurisdiction is unjustified, courts must decline to exercise jurisdiction that is inappropriately invoked by one of the parties.
       For example, if one parent abducts the child pre-decree and establishes a new home State, that jurisdiction will decline to hear the case.
       There are exceptions.
       If the other party has acquiesced in the court's jurisdiction, the court may hear the case.
       Such acquiescence may occur by filing a pleading submitting to the jurisdiction, or by not filing in the court that would otherwise have jurisdiction under this Act.
       Similarly, if the court that would have jurisdiction finds that the court of this State is a more appropriate forum, the court may hear the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to those situations where jurisdiction exists because of the unjustified conduct of the person seeking to invoke it.
       If, for example, a parent in the State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 has either restrained the child from visiting with the other parent, or has retained the child after visitation, and seeks to modify the decree, this section in inapplicable.
       The conduct of restraining or retaining the child did not create jurisdiction.
       Jurisdiction existed under this Act without regard to the parent's conduct.
       Whether a court should decline to hear the parent's request to modify is a matter of local law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The focus in this section is on the unjustified conduct of the person who invokes the jurisdiction of the court.
       A technical illegality or wrong is insufficient to trigger the applicability of this section.
       This is particularly important in cases involving domestic violence and child abuse. Domestic violence victims should not be charged with unjustifiable conduct for conduct that occurred in the process of fleeing domestic violence, even if their conduct is technically illegal.
       Thus, if a parent flees with a child to escape domestic violence and in the process violates a joint custody decree, the case should not be automatically dismissed under this section.
       An inquiry must be made into whether the flight was justified under the circumstances of the case. However, an abusive parent who seizes the child and flees to another State to establish jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct and the new State must decline to exercise jurisdiction under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) authorizes the court to fashion an appropriate remedy for the safety of the child and to prevent a repetition of the unjustified conduct.
       Thus, it would be appropriate for the court to notify the other parent and to provide for foster care for the child until the child is returned to the other parent.
       The court could also stay the proceeding and require that a custody proceeding be instituted in another State that would have jurisdiction under this Act.
       It should be noted that the court is not making a forum non conveniens analysis in this section.
       If the conduct is unjustifiable, it must decline jurisdiction.
       It may, however, retain jurisdiction until a custody proceeding is commenced in the appropriate tribunal if such retention is necessary to prevent a repetition of the wrongful conduct or to ensure the safety of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney's fee standard for this section is patterned after the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, 42 U.S.C.

       The pleading requirements from Section 9 of the UCCJA are generally carried over into this Act.
       However, the information is made subject to local law on the protection of names and other identifying information in certain cases. A number of States have enacted laws relating to the protection of victims in domestic violence and child abuse cases which provide for the confidentiality of victims names, addresses, and other information.
       These procedures must be followed if the child-custody proceeding of the State requires their applicability.
       See, e.g., California Family Law Code
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       3409(a).
       If a State does not have local law that provides for protecting names and addresses, then subsection (e) or a similar provision should be adopted.
       Subsection (e) is based on the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judge's, Model Code on Domestic and Family Violence
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>

      </p>
      <p>
       In subsection (a)(2), the term "proceedings" should be read broadly to include more than custody proceedings.
       Thus, if one parent was being criminally prosecuted for child abuse or custodial interference, those proceedings should be disclosed.
       If the child is subject to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, facts relating to compliance with the Compact should be disclosed in the pleading or affidavit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) has been added.
       It authorizes the court to stay the proceeding until the information required in subsection (a) has been disclosed, although failure to provide the information does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear the case.
       This follows the majority of jurisdictions which held that failure to comply with the pleading requirements of the UCCJA did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to make a custody determination.

       No major changes have been made to this section which was Section 11 of the UCCJA.
       Language was added to subsection (a) to authorize the court to require a non-party who has physical custody of the child to produce the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) authorizes the court to enter orders providing for the safety of the child and the person ordered to appear with the child.
       If safety is a major concern, the court, as an alternative to ordering a party to appear with the child, could order and arrange for the party's testimony to be taken in another State under Section 111.
       This alternative might be important when there are safety concerns regarding requiring victims of domestic violence or child abuse to travel to the jurisdiction where the abuser resides.

       Specific mention of ICARA proceedings is necessary because they often occur prior to any formal custody determination.
       However, the need for a speedy enforcement remedy for an order to return the child is just as necessary.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section is based on Section 13 of the UCCJA which contained the basic duty to enforce.
       The language of the original section has been retained and the duty to enforce is generally the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enforcement of custody determinations of issuing States is also required by federal law in the PKPA, 28 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738A(a).
       The changes made in Article 2 of this Act now make a State's duty to enforce and not modify a child custody determination of another State consistent with the enforcement and nonmodification provisions of the PKPA.
       Therefore custody determinations made by a State pursuant to the UCCJA that would be enforceable under the PKPA will generally be enforced under this Act.
       However, if a State custody determination made pursuant to the UCCJA would not be enforceable under the PKPA, it will also not be enforceable under this Act.
       Thus a custody determination made by a "significant connection" jurisdiction when there is a home State is not enforceable under the PKPA regardless of whether a proceeding was ever commenced in the home State.
       Even though such a determination would be enforceable under the UCCJA with its four concurrent bases of jurisdiction, it would not be enforceable under this Act.
       This carries out the policy of the PKPA of strongly discouraging a State from exercising its concurrent "significant connection" jurisdiction under the UCCJA when another State could exercise "home state" jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section also incorporates the concept of Section 15 of the UCCJA to the effect that a custody determination of another State will be enforced in the same manner as a custody determination made by a court of this State.
       Whatever remedies are available to enforce a local determination can be utilized to enforce a custody determination of another State. However, it remains a custody determination of the State that issued it.
       A child-custody determination of another State is not subject to modification unless the State would have jurisdiction to modify the determination under Article 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remedies provided by this article for the enforcement of a custody determination will normally be used.
       This article does not detract from other remedies available under other local law. There is often a need for a number of remedies to ensure that a child-custody determination is obeyed.
       If other remedies would easily facilitate enforcement, they are still available.
       The petitioner, for example, can still cite the respondent for contempt of court or file a tort claim for intentional interference with custodial relations if those remedies are available under local law.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       This section authorizes a court to issue a temporary order if it is necessary to enforce visitation rights without violating the rules on nonmodification contained in Section 303. Therefore, if there is a visitation schedule provided in the custody determination that was made in accordance with Article 2, a court can issue an order under this section implementing the schedule.
       An implementing order may include make-up or substitute visitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A court may also issue a temporary order providing for visitation if visitation was authorized in the custody determination, but no specific schedule was included in the custody determination.
       Such an order could include a substitution of a specific visitation schedule for "reasonable and seasonable."
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a court may not, under subsection (a)(2) provide for a permanent change in visitation.
       Therefore, requests for a permanent change in the visitation schedule must be addressed to the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202 or modification jurisdiction under Section 203. As under Section 204, subsection (b) of this section requires that the temporary visitation order stay in effect only long enough to allow the person who obtained the order to obtain a permanent modification in the State with appropriate jurisdiction under Article 2.

       - Case was only about the registration of custody and visitation orders from another state under the provisions of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Virginia law and as the custody orders were made consistently with the provisions of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, Virginia must extend full faith and credit to the custody orders; as neither party was asking the court to recognize the relationship of the biological father and the father named on the birth certificate as a valid marriage in the Commonwealth and the custody orders did not arise from fathers' relationship being treated as a marriage, the Defense of Marriage Act, 28 U.S.C.S.

       Circuit court properly granted a father's petition to register a foreign child custody order because the trial was not marred by extrinsic fraud; the father's statement that he would not travel to Virginia occurred before the mother filed for summary judgment, and regardless of whether his presence was necessary, the filing of the motion potentially changed the dynamic of the registration litigation and made it impossible to determine whether the statement was made with fraudulent intent.

       This remainder of this article provides enforcement mechanisms for interstate child custody determinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes a simple registration procedure that can be used to predetermine the enforceability of a custody determination.
       It parallels the process in UIFSA for the registration of child support orders.
       It should be as much of an aid to pro se litigants as the registration procedure of UIFSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       A custody determination can be registered without any accompanying request for enforcement.
       This may be of significant assistance in international cases.
       For example, the custodial parent under a foreign custody order can receive an advance determination of whether that order would be recognized and enforced before sending the child to the United States for visitation.
       Article 26 of the 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children, 35 I.L.M. 1391 (1996), requires those States which accede to the Convention to provide such a procedure.

       However, it remains a custody determination of the State that issued it.

       The pleading rules of Section 308, require the parties to disclose any pending proceedings.
       Normally, an enforcement proceeding will take precedence over a modification action since the PKPA requires enforcement of child custody determinations made in accordance with its terms.
       However, the enforcement court must communicate with the modification court in order to avoid duplicative litigation.
       The courts might decide that the court with jurisdiction under Article 2 shall continue with the modification action and stay the enforcement proceeding.
       Or they might decide that the enforcement proceeding shall go forward.
       The ultimate decision rests with the court having exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202, or if there is no State with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction, then the decision rests with the State that would have jurisdiction to modify under Section 203.
       Therefore, if that court determines that the enforcement proceeding should be stayed or dismissed, the enforcement court should stay or dismiss the proceeding.
       If the enforcement court does not do so, the court with exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 202, or with modification jurisdiction under Section 203, could enjoin the parties from continuing with the enforcement proceeding.

       This section provides the normal remedy that will be used in interstate cases: the production of the child in a summary, remedial process based on habeas corpus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition is intended to provide the court with as much information as possible.
       Attaching certified copies of all orders sought to be enforced allows the court to have the necessary information.
       Most of the information relates to the permissible scope of the court's inquiry.
       The petitioner has the responsibility to inform the court of all proceedings that would affect the current enforcement action.
       Specific mention is made of certain proceedings to ensure that they are disclosed.
       A "procedure relating to domestic violence" includes not only protective order proceedings but also criminal prosecutions for child abuse or domestic violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The order requires the respondent to appear at a hearing on the next judicial day.
       The term "next judicial day" in this section means the next day when a judge is at the courthouse. At the hearing, the court will order the child to be delivered to the petitioner unless the respondent is prepared to assert that the issuing State lacked jurisdiction, that notice was not given in accordance with Section 108, or that the order sought to be enforced has been vacated, modified, or stayed by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Article 2.
       The court is also to order payment of the fees and expenses set out in Section 312.
       The court may set another hearing to determine whether additional relief available under this state's law should be granted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the order has been registered and confirmed in accordance with Section 304, the only defense to enforcement is that the order has been vacated, stayed or modified since the registration proceeding by a court with jurisdiction to do so under Article 2.

       The scope of inquiry for the enforcing court is quite limited.
       Federal law requires the court to enforce the custody determination if the issuing state's decree was rendered in compliance with the PKPA.
       28 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738A(a).
       This Act requires enforcement of custody determinations that are made in conformity with Article 2's jurisdictional rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       The certified copy, or a copy of the certified copy, of the custody determination entitling the petitioner to the child is prima facie evidence of the issuing court's jurisdiction to enter the order.
       If the order is one that is entitled to be enforced under Article 2 and if it has been violated, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that the custody determination is not entitled to enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a defense to enforcement that another jurisdiction has issued a custody determination that is required to be enforced under Article 2.
       An example is when one court has based its original custody determination on the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       3(a)(2) (significant connections) and another jurisdiction has rendered an original custody determination based on the UCCJA
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       3(a)(1) (home State).
       When this occurs, Article 2 of this Act, as well as the PKPA, mandate that the home state determination be enforced in all other States, including the State that rendered the significant connections determination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of notice in accordance with Section 108 by a person entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard at the original custody determination is a defense to enforcement of the custody determination.
       The scope of the defense under this Act is the same as the defense would be under the law of the State that issued the notice.
       Thus, if the defense of lack of notice would not be available under local law if the respondent purposely hid from the petitioner, took deliberate steps to avoid service of process or elected not to participate in the initial proceedings, the defense would also not be available under this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no other defenses to an enforcement action.
       If the child would be endangered by the enforcement of a custody or visitation order, there may be a basis for the assumption of emergency jurisdiction under Section 204 of this Act.
       Upon the finding of an emergency, the court issues a temporary order and directs the parties to proceed either in the court that is exercising continuing jurisdiction over the custody proceeding under Section 202, or the court that would have jurisdiction to modify the custody determination under Section 203.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court shall determine at the hearing whether fees should be awarded under Section 312.
       If so, it should order them paid.
       The court may determine if additional relief is appropriate, including requesting law enforcement officers to assist the petitioner in the enforcement of the order.
       The court may set a hearing to determine whether further relief should be granted.

        Comment. -
       </b>
       The section provides a remedy for emergency situations where there is a reason to believe that the child will suffer imminent, serious physical harm or be removed from the jurisdiction once the respondent learns that the petitioner has filed an enforcement proceeding.
       If the court finds such harm exists, it should temporarily waive the notice requirements and issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child.
       Immediately after the warrant is executed, the respondent is to receive notice of the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "harm" cannot be totally defined and, as in the issuance of temporary retraining orders, the appropriate issuance of a warrant is left to the circumstances of the case.
       Those circumstances include cases where the respondent is the subject of a criminal proceeding as well as situations where the respondent is secreting the child in violation of a court order, abusing the child, a flight risk and other circumstances that the court concludes make the issuance of notice a danger to the child.
       The court must hear the testimony of the petitioner or another witness prior to issuing the warrant.
       The testimony may be heard in person, via telephone, or by any other means acceptable under local law.
       The court must State the reasons for the issuance of the warrant.
       The warrant can be enforced by law enforcement officers wherever the child is found in the State.
       The warrant may authorize entry upon private property to pick up the child if no less intrusive means are possible.
       In extraordinary cases, the warrant may authorize law enforcement to make a forcible entry at any hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The warrant must provide for the placement of the child pending the determination of the enforcement proceeding. Since the issuance of the warrant would not occur absent a risk of serious harm to the child, placement cannot be with the respondent.
       Normally, the child would be placed with the petitioner.
       However, if placement with the petitioner is not indicated, the court can order any other appropriate placement authorized under the laws of the court's State.
       Placement with the petitioner may not be indicated if there is a likelihood that the petitioner also will flee the jurisdiction.
       Placement with the petitioner may not be practical if the petitioner is proceeding through an attorney and is not present before the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes the court to utilize whatever means are available under local law to ensure the appearance of the petitioner and child at the enforcement hearing.
       Such means might include cash bonds, a surrender of a passport, or whatever the court determines is necessary.

       By placing subsection A of this section in Article 3 of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) and by using a prevailing-party standard rather than one based on equitable determinations, the legislature intended to confine subsection A's application to the enforcement-related proceedings set forth in Article 3 of the UCCJEA.

       Normally the court will award fees and costs against the non-prevailing party. Included as expenses are the amount of investigation fees incurred by private persons or by public officials as well as the cost of child placement during the proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The non-prevailing party has the burden of showing that such an award would be clearly inappropriate.
       Fees and costs may be inappropriate if their payment would cause the parent and child to seek public assistance.

       The order may be appealed as an expedited civil matter.
       An enforcement order should not be stayed by the court. Provisions for a stay would defeat the purpose of having a quick enforcement procedure.
       If there is a risk of serious mistreatment or abuse to the child, a petition to assume emergency jurisdiction must be filed under Section 204.
       This section leaves intact the possibility of obtaining an extraordinary remedy such as mandamus or prohibition from an appellate court to stay the court's enforcement action.
       In many States, it is not possible to limit the constitutional authority of appellate courts to issue a stay.
       However, unless the information before the appellate panel indicates that emergency jurisdiction would be assumed under Section 204, there is no reason to stay the enforcement of the order pending appeal.

        Separate property found.

       - Although the property was marital when acquired by the parties as tenants by the entireties in 1989, husband and wife executed a deed of gift transferring the wife's interest to husband immediately after closing and that deed provided that the property was to be held by husband "in his own right as his separate and equitable estate as if he were an unmarried man . . . free from the control and marital rights of his present . . . spouse" and "with full and complete power . . . [to] dispose of the . . . property . . . during his lifetime . . . [or by] devise," therefore, that property was husband's separate property. McDavid v. McDavid, 19 Va. App. 406, 451 S.E.2d 713 (1994).

       Circuit court properly determined that the former marital home was the wife's separate property because a deed, transferring the home from the husband and the wife to the wife only, after the last separation of the parties was a marital agreement, and the husband's other arguments on appeal were not preserved for review.

       Reconciliation comprehends a fresh start and genuine effort by both parties. It must be shown that the parties: (1) intend to live together as husband and wife and take up their respective roles in the relationship; (2) establish a home and live together in a normal relationship as husband and wife; (3) resume the performance of marital duties while living together on a continuous basis; and (4) exhibit good faith and a genuine intent; and, resumption of sexual relations is only one factor in establishing a reconciliation.

       - Document addressing the parties' home which clearly described the parties' rights and responsibilities was a sufficient agreement, and thus the wife received the house and the husband was ordered to pay off the liens; the fact that a property settlement agreement only dealt with a portion of the assets of the parties did not invalidate the agreement provided it was complete.

       The 2019 amendments.
      </b>
      - The 2019 amendment by c. 375 rewrote the definition for "Intended parent," which read: "'Intended parents' means a man and a woman, married to each other, who enter into an agreement with a surrogate under the terms of which they will be the parents of any child born to the surrogate through assisted conception regardless of the genetic relationships between the intended parents, the surrogate, and the child."; added the definition for "Legal or contractual custody"; in the definitions for "Surrogacy contract" and "Surrogate," substituted "the intended parent" for "intended parents" throughout and substituted "spouse" for "husband"; and made stylistic changes.

        Constitutionality.

       - Virginia assisted conception statute in its current form does not comply with constitutional requirements because it discriminates in conferring a statutory benefit of marriage solely on the basis of whether a spouse of a gestational mother is a husband or a wife; a husband of a gestational mother becomes a parent, a wife of a gestational mother does not, and the appropriate remedy is to extend the benefits of the statute to same-sex spouses of gestational mothers.

        Child born of the parties.
       </b>
       - Minor child was recognized as a child born of the parties in the final decree of divorce because the child was born through assisted conception during the time of the parties' marriage; consistent with the marital benefits bestowed upon the spouse of a gestational mother who conceived a child during the marriage, the gestational mother's partner was considered a parent. Appel v. Celia, 98 Va. Cir. 140, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 15 (Fairfax County Feb. 8, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there was no clear definition of the phrase "born of the parties," and the Virginia General Assembly placed importance on minor children in its no-fault divorce statute, a minor child was born of the parties; the circuit court inferred that the Virginia General Assembly considered the impact of divorce on young children when distinguishing litigants with minor children from litigants without any children or litigants with only adult children.
