       Transition provisions.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      At its regular session of 1966 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to revise certain titles of the Code, including Title 61, relating to warehouses, cold storage and refrigerated locker plants. In June of 1967 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision of Title 61, which was published as House Document 4 of the 1968 session. This report contained revisor’s notes and other explanatory matter, which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission’s draft of the revision of Title 61, as amended by the General Assembly, became chapter 69 of the Acts of 1968. Effective Oct. 1, 1968, it repealed Title 61 of the Code and enacted a new Title 61.1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 61.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1968, c. 69, clauses 3-5 and 7, provide as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “3. All acts and parts of acts, all sections of the Code of Virginia, and all provisions of municipal charters inconsistent with the provisions of this act are, except as otherwise provided, repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
     </p>
     <p>
      “4. The repeal of Title 61 effective as of October 1, 1968, shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued or accruing on or before such date, or any prosecution, suit or action pending on that date. Except as in this act otherwise provided, neither the repeal of Title 61 of the Code of Virginia nor the enactment of Title 61.1 shall apply to offenses committed prior to October 1, 1968, and prosecutions for such offenses shall be governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose. For the purposes of this act, an offense was committed prior to October 1, 1968, if any of the essential elements of the offense occurred prior thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      “5. Whenever in Title 61.1 any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 61, as such title existed prior to October 1, 1968, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article or chapter of Title 61.1, and whenever any such former section, article or chapter of Title 61 is given a new number in Title 61.1, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 61 appearing elsewhere in the Code of Virginia than in Title 61.1 shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions or contents or portions thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      “7. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set out herein, and if any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this act shall ever be declared unconstitutional, it shall be deemed severable, and the remainder of this act shall continue in full force and effect.”
