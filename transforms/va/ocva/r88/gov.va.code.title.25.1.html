       Transition provisions.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In June 2002, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the revision of Title 25, establishing procedures for exercising the power of eminent domain. Title 25 had not been revised since the adoption of the Code of Virginia in 1950. During the past 52 years, many changes have been made to the procedures applicable to the condemnation of property. The primary purpose of the Title 25 revision was to reorganize the laws in a logical manner and improve their structure and clarity, while seeking to remove or update archaic references and conform the provisions to current statutory drafting protocols, incorporating current practices, resolving confusion caused by conflicting provisions and conforming certain provisions to other statutes. The revision, as amended and adopted by the General Assembly, became Acts 2003, c. 940, effective July 1, 2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      Title 25 was rewritten primarily as new Title 25.1, with certain sections relocated elsewhere.
      In addition, provisions in titles other than Title 25 that authorize entities to acquire property by condemnation were also amended.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where appropriate, the historical citations to former sections of Title 25 have been added to corresponding new sections.
     </p>
     <p>
      The case notes appearing under new sections were decided under corresponding former sections or prior law.
     </p>
     <p>
      For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 2, provides: “That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section or chapter of Title 25 or any other title of the Code of Virginia as such titles existed prior to July 1, 2003, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section or chapter of Title 25.1 or any other title of the Code and whenever any such former section or chapter is given a new number in Title 25.1 or any other title, all references to any such former section or chapter of Title 25 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents or portions thereof.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 3, provides: “That the regulations of any department or agency affected by the revision of Title 25 or such other titles in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations adopted under this act.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 4, provides: “That the provisions of § 30-152 of the Code of Virginia shall apply to the codification of Title 25.1 so as to give effect to other laws enacted by the 2003 Session of the General Assembly.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 5, provides: “That the repeal of Title 25 shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty incurred, or any right established, accrued or accruing on or before such date, or any proceeding, prosecution, suit or action pending on that day.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 6, provides: “That any notice given, recognizance taken, or process or writ issued before July 1, 2003, shall be valid although given, taken or to be returned to a day after such date, in like manner as if Title 25.1 had been effective before the same was given, taken or issued.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 7, provides: “That if any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or section of Title 25.1 shall be adjudged in any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or section thereof directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered, and to this end the provisions of Title 25.1 are declared severable.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts
      2022, c. 734, cl. 2 provides: “That the provisions of this act shall not apply to condemnation proceedings in which the petitioner filed prior to July 1, 2022, (i) a petition in condemnation pursuant to Chapter 2 ( §

     </p>
     <p>
      Acts
      2022, c. 735, cl. 3 provides: “That the provisions of this act shall apply only to the taking of or damage to property that has occurred on or after July 1, 2022, or a condemnation proceeding that has been filed on or after July 1, 2022, as appropriate.”

      At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, “23.1-1100” was substituted for “23-14” in the definition of “State institution” to conform to the recodification of Title 23 by Acts 2016, c. 588, effective October 1, 2016.

When such restrictions are imposed they must be obeyed. If the limitations or restrictions imposed involve public inconvenience, or retard the progress of public improvements, the remedy is an appeal to the legislature. They cannot be removed by judicial construction. The courts cannot enlarge a power which the legislature has restricted. School Bd. v. Alexander,

       Without further interference with an owner’s right to use and dispose of his land, the filing of condemnation proceedings and a lis pendens does not constitute a taking of the property requiring just compensation under the Virginia Constitution.

       When the eminent domain statute is read as a whole and given a reasonable construction, it is evident that it provides for the ascertainment of damages in condemnation proceedings instituted by corporations and cities where no part of the property is actually taken, but only damaged. Therefore a municipality has the right to have ascertained the consequential damages to the property of abutting owners, by reason of the change in grade of a street, no part of said property, nor interest or estate therein, being sought to be taken.

       A power company sought to condemn easements across two tracts of land for the erection of transmission lines and unlocated rights of ingress and egress to the easements for purposes of construction and maintenance. Such secondary easements were held subject to acquisition by condemnation. The power company’s attempt to acquire such unlocated secondary easements was not, as contended by the landowners, an arbitrary exercise of its power of eminent domain. Prompt repair of the lines might at any time be required in the public interest, and ready access could not be had to them over the roads bounding the tracts involved. VEPCO v. Webb,

       In a case in which the city council adopted an ordinance closing the portion of a road that abutted the landowner’s property to all non-emergency vehicular traffic, that exercise of police power by the city did not, as a matter of law, deprive the landowner of reasonable access because the landowner retained access to its property through a major public highway; and, although the landowner’s lost access to the road, although qualifying as a direct loss of access, was not a material impairment of direct access to property.

       The parties to a condemnation proceeding are not in the position of plaintiffs and defendants in traditional actions or suits.
       Traditional burden-of-proof rules are inapplicable to condemnation cases.
       The petitioner in a condemnation case is, therefore, not a traditional plaintiff.

       he has the statutory duty to institute the proceeding, he has no ultimate risk of nonpersuasion. Trout v. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r,

       After the condemnor has acquired title and instituted the proceeding for the ascertainment of just compensation, he is in the position of a defendant.

       Whether any particular change in access to a specific landowner’s property constitutes compensable lost access is a fact-dependent question and, therefore, is properly a matter for the body determining just compensation to resolve, based on the evidence in each case. Whether there is a material impairment of direct access and whether a property owner is entitled to just compensation for lost access are questions of fact properly left to the body determining just compensation, unless the facts in a specific case lead the court to conclude that reasonable persons cannot differ, in which circumstance the court may proceed with the determination as a matter of law.

       Construing together former similar section and §§ 56-17 through 56-22, it is seen that the section related to a condemnation proceeding under which, by force of the power of eminent domain, it was intended to condemn and take a fee simple interest in property belonging to another corporation, and not to the crossing of the tracks of one railroad company by another.

       In proceedings before the State Corporation Commission on a petition by one railroad to prevent another from crossing at grade, there is no question of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. One railroad has the absolute power to cross another, and the crossing is a privilege granted and is not a taking of property within the meaning of the condemnation statutes. Hence, former similar section did not apply. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Tidewater Ry., 11 Va. L. Reg. 518 (1905).

       In a proceeding before the State Corporation Commission by a city for permission to condemn the property of a railroad company for a recreation park, the owners and lessors of the land sought to be condemned admitted that it was not essential to their purposes. The only question before the Commission, therefore, was whether a public necessity or an essential public convenience required the condemnation of the land. The city, after a careful survey of the situation, had declared that an essential public convenience or public necessity required that the property in question be taken. The Commission approved that conclusion, and the Supreme Court approved the action of the Commission. Page v. Commonwealth,

       In the proceeding before the Commission under former similar section it is authorized to pass upon questions of “public necessity” and “essential public convenience” as well as whether the property was essential to corporation’s purposes. Here the Commission acted in the nature of an umpire for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of all parties affected, including the public, and its action was judicial in nature. Hence it was appropriate, under the circumstances, to invoke the Commission’s rule of practice pertaining to declaratory judgments. Boulevard Bridge Corp. v. City of Richmond,

       The State Corporation Commission is expressly authorized by the Constitution to exercise functions which are much broader in their general scope than those ordinarily coming under the judicial department, and in the proper performance of these duties admits and hears parties who, in the strict legal sense, are not interested in the subject matter. Permitting citizens, taxpayers and owners of property adjacent to the property sought to be condemned in a proceeding under former similar section to intervene did not affect their status as interested parties, nor did it necessarily follow that the Commission was of opinion that they were interested parties, in the legal sense.

       In a condemnation proceeding, although the city’s initial offer erroneously offset the purported enhancement of vacating the old water main easement against the value of the new easement, and the offer did not contain any amount for damages, the city used an erroneous measure of just compensation when it made a deduction from the offer for the claimed enhancement; however, despite the error, the offer was made in good faith as there had been no evidence that the city acted with any ill intent; and mere incorrectness in the quantum of the offer, without a showing of bad faith, was insufficient to make out a violation of the statutory mandate that the city make a bona fide offer before initiating a condemnation proceeding.

However, accepting the facts asserted by the owners as true for the purpose of ruling on housing authority’s motion to strike the owners’ objections and affirmative defenses, the court could not hold that the housing authority made a bona fide offer to the owner, because the appraisal upon which the bona fide offer was based allegedly did not appraise the entire property sought and the appraisal allegedly was not conducted using accepted appraisal methodology.

Though one of the landowners showed that he owned another parcel which adjoined that over which the power company sought its easements, it could not be said as a matter of law that this other parcel was likely to be damaged by construction of the transmission lines. Therefore, the court erred in requiring the company, at the landowner’s request, to include a description of it in its petition. VEPCO v. Webb,

      Though Title 25.1 denies a condemnee who has been served notice by publication the ability to petition for a rehearing, it is still designed to ensure that the condemnee receives just compensation; while the reasoning may seem slightly circular, the process the Commonwealth chooses to employ in reaching compensation in a condemnation case where notice is given by publication, even if it differs with other procedures in separate code sections, does not deny “just” compensation as long as just compensation is the actual result.

       Thus, prejudicial error was committed where the court failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of the section to enter an order fixing a date for the trial of the issue of just compensation and, as a result, condemnees received no notice of the time of the trial and were not afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

       Because of the great responsibility and relative independence vested in condemnation commissioners to ascertain the value of the property to be taken, there is no burden of proof, in the common-law sense, on the issue of just compensation, and no ultimate “risk of non-persuasion” on the issue.

      <p>
       Trial court judgment confirming a commission’s award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealth’s appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners’ alleged business plan for development of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any award of damages for the additional parcels.

      <p>
       Any project proposed by a condemning authority to enter upon property for the purpose of constructing works or improvements necessarily involves planning, designing, and funding; the inclusion of the term “emergency” in Title 25.1 of the Code suggests that it is not limited to tasks that must be completed in days or hours. In that context, there was an emergency or an immediate necessity or pressing need for petitioner to enter onto respondent’s property without further delay to complete construction of the project.

       The legislature has full power to require any company exercising the power of eminent domain to make compensation to any person whose property is damaged by the proposed improvement, whether any portion of the property is actually taken or not. To constitute damages there need be no physical invasion of the owner’s real property; the owner may recover if the construction and operation of the improvement would amount to a private nuisance at common law, or if it is the cause of substantial damage, though consequential.

       Trial court judgment confirming a commission’s award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealth’s appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners’ alleged business plan for development of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any award of damages for the additional parcels.

       Whether any particular change in access to a specific landowner’s property constitutes compensable lost access is a fact-dependent question and, therefore, is properly a matter for the body determining just compensation to resolve, based on the evidence in each case. Whether there is a material impairment of direct access and whether a property owner is entitled to just compensation for lost access are questions of fact properly left to the body determining just compensation, unless the facts in a specific case lead the court to conclude that reasonable persons cannot differ, in which circumstance the court may proceed with the determination as a matter of law.

        No material impairment of direct access to property. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which the city council adopted an ordinance closing the portion of a road that abutted the landowner’s property to all non-emergency vehicular traffic, that exercise of police power by the city did not, as a matter of law, deprive the landowner of reasonable access because the landowner retained access to its property through a major public highway; and the landowner’s lost access to the road, although qualifying as a direct loss of access, was not a material impairment of direct access to property. Thus, the closure did not constitute a taking that entitled the landowner to compensation. Hooked Grp., LLC v. City of Chesapeake,

      <p>
       Whether any particular change in access to a specific landowner’s property constitutes compensable lost access is a fact-dependent question and, therefore, is properly a matter for the body determining just compensation to resolve, based on the evidence in each case. Whether there is a material impairment of direct access and whether a property owner is entitled to just compensation for lost access are questions of fact properly left to the body determining just compensation, unless the facts in a specific case lead the court to conclude that reasonable persons cannot differ, in which circumstance the court may proceed with the determination as a matter of law.

      <p>
       The legislature did not intend that the statute be utilized to conduct a “fishing expedition” in the hope that upon recalling and questioning the commissioners, improper conduct might appear. VEPCO v. Shaffer,

        Factual allegation required. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear import of the statute was that there had to be some factual allegation of improper conduct which cast suspicion upon the integrity of the commissioners’ report before the judge was required to recall the commissioners and question them. A mere allegation of improper conduct, without stating what actions of the commissioners constituted such, was a conclusion of law which furnished neither information for the trial judge to determine the sufficiency of the exceptions nor a basis upon which he might frame questions to examine the commissioners. Whether misconduct entered into the report of the commissioners was a factual question, and good pleading required that such an allegation be supported by facts which, if proved, would amount to misconduct in fact. VEPCO v. Shaffer,
       <cite class="va_code">

       Trial court judgment confirming a commission’s award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealth’s appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners’ alleged business plan for development of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any award of damages for the additional parcels.

       Lease did not limit the tenant’s potential claims and the lease protected certain portions of the award for the tenant from the landlord attempting to claim them during the proceeding. The lease did not specifically state that the tenant was limited or prohibited from requesting or arguing for portions of the award beyond what the landlord was proscribed from claiming against the tenant and thus, it was apparent that the lease expressed the clear intent of the parties to not limit the tenant’s claims during a condemnation proceeding and the tenant could use Virginia’s statutory framework to seek an award.

       Former § 25-46.28, along with §§ 33.1-124, 33.1-128, and former Sup. Ct. R. 3:9A [now Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:12], authorized a taxpayer availing himself of § 33.1-124 to petition the court to join the lienholder as a party and petition the court either to order the check made payable to the lienholder or to make specific provisions for the lienholder’s liability for refund of any excess withdrawal. Thus, where the taxpayer did not so petition the court, but simply requested that the court impose liability upon the person to whom the excess was “paid,” he was, within the meaning of the section, paid and therefore was liable for refunding the amount of excess withdrawn that exceeded the actual condemnation award.

       Commissioners appointed to assess the damages for land to be taken for a public use have no power, where there is a controversy or doubt as to who is entitled to such compensation or damage, or in what proportions, to pass upon or determine who is entitled to the same. If, in their report of the damages assessed, they also attempt to apportion the damages amongst those entitled, the apportionment should be stricken out as surplusage. Carson v. City of Richmond,

         Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property; however, the requirements of this subdivision shall not apply if the state agency’s official who is responsible for the acquisition determines that the value of the property being acquired is less than $25,000, based on assessment records or other objective evidence. Whenever the value of the property being acquired is determined to be between $10,000 and $25,000, the state agency, at the time an offer is made initiating negotiations, shall disclose to the owner or his designated representative that the offer has been established based on assessment records or other objective evidence and not an appraisal and that he may request that an appraisal be prepared and used as the basis for establishing just compensation pursuant to this section.

         Before making an offer to acquire or initiating any related negotiations for real property, the state agency shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation therefor and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the state agency’s approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, if such an appraisal is required, or the current assessed value of such property for real estate tax purposes, unless the property has physically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fair valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the assessment is made is to be acquired, whichever is greater. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which such property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, shall be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The state agency concerned shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation and, if an appraisal is required or obtained, such written statement and summary shall include a complete copy of all appraisals of the real property to be acquired that the state agency obtained prior to making an offer to acquire or initiating any related negotiations for the real property. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated.

         If the state agency permits an owner or tenant to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term for a period subject to termination by the state agency on a short notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier.
