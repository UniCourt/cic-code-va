       Transition provisions.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      At its regular session of 1977, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a study of the laws governing public elementary and secondary education in the Commonwealth and to recommend to the House Education Committee and the Senate Education and Health Committee such legislation as the members of the Commission should deem advisable or necessary. In January of 1980, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 22, Education. This report, which was published as House Document No. 21 of the 1980 session, contains reviser’s notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission’s draft of the revision of Title 22, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 559 of the Acts of 1980. Effective Oct. 1, 1980, it repeals Title 22 and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 22.1.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to its revision by c. 559, former Title 22 was also amended by certain other acts passed at the 1980 session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated these amendments into new Title 22.1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 22 and earlier statutes.

     <p>
      A locality does not have the authority to enact an ordinance imposing a civil or criminal penalty against a parent enrolling a child based on false information that indicates the parent and child are residents of the local government, or to enact an ordinance holding a parent liable for the tuition or educational costs in such a situation. See opinion of Attorney General to Delegate M. Kirkland Cox, 04-094, 2005 Va. AG LEXIS 10 (4/7/05).

      <b>
       The categories in this section are not exclusive,

Prior to the submission of a consolidation proposal, the submitting school board shall give notice to the public and shall conduct one or more public hearings.School divisions submitting proposals for consolidation shall include such information and data as may be necessary to support their proposal, including (i) the criteria set forth in subsection C; (ii) evidence of the cost savings to be realized by such consolidation; (iii) a plan for the transfer of title to school board property to the resulting combined school board governing the consolidated division; (iv) procedures and a schedule for the proposed consolidation, including completion of current division superintendent and school board member terms; (v) a plan for proportional school board representation of the localities comprising the new school division, including details regarding the appointment or election processes currently ensuring such representation and other information as may be necessary to evidence compliance with federal and state laws governing voting rights; and (vi) evidence of local support for the proposed consolidation.For five years following completion of such consolidation, the computation of the state and local share for an educational program meeting the standards of quality for school divisions resulting from consolidations approved pursuant to this subsection shall be the lower composite index of local ability-to-pay of the applicant school divisions, as provided in the appropriation act.

       Where the effect of a new second-class city’s proposal was to erect new boundary lines for the purpose of school attendance in a district where no such lines had previously existed, and where a racially dual school system had long flourished, the proposal would be judged according to whether it hindered or furthered the process of school desegregation. If the proposal would impede the dismantling of the dual system, then a federal district court, in the exercise of its remedial discretion, could enjoin it from being carried out. Wright v.

       Parents of elementary school students who sued the school board were unsuccessful in their attempt to annul its adoption of new school attendance zones, as they failed to meet their burden under § 22.1-87 to prove the board’s redistricting decision affecting their children was arbitrary, capricious, or done in bad faith.

       Sovereign immunity protection provided to a school board, as an agency or arm of the Commonwealth, for tort claims encompasses quasi-contract claims as well, and neither the common law obligation of the Commonwealth to abide by its contracts nor the statute subjects the Commonwealth to quasi-contract claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit; these causes of action are not subject to the theories and remedies of contract law nor are they “immixed” with contract or “arise therefrom.” Akian, Inc. v.

        Constitutionality of system of appointing school boards. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the system of appointing district school boards was conceived and maintained until 1971 for the purpose of limiting African-American participation in the selection of and participation on school boards, in a challenge to the system based on the federal Constitution and the Voting Rights Act the state met its burden of showing that since 1971 the system has not been maintained for racially discriminatory reasons. Irby v. Fitz-Hugh, 693 F. Supp. 424, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9099 (E.D. Va. 1988), aff'd, 889 F.2d 1352, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 17735 (4th Cir. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Virginia’s statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the First Amendment, even though some of the original supporters of that scheme hoped it would exclude African-Americans from school boards. Such an effect is by no means inevitable and the statutes do not facially place a unique burden on African-Americans. Irby v. Fitz-Hugh, 692 F. Supp. 610, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17201 (E.D.

      </p>
      <p>
       Virginia’s statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment, even though the system appears to limit African-American participation. The Fifteenth Amendment, the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment address the issue directly and can provide adequate protection. Irby v. Fitz-Hugh, 692 F.

       Virginia’s statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, even though some of the original supporters of that scheme hoped it would exclude African-Americans from school boards, where no law has been violated by the act of appointing school boards, no preexisting right to vote has been contravened, and no infringement of a fundamental right has been identified.

      Upon a petition filed with the circuit court of any county to which the provisions of this article are applicable signed by a number of registered voters of the county equal to fifteen per centum of the number of votes cast in the county in the preceding presidential election asking that a referendum be held on the question of changing the method of selection of members of the county school board, the court shall, by order entered of record, require the regular election officials on the day fixed in such order to open the polls and take the sense of the qualified voters of the county on the question printed on the ballot as herein provided.
      The clerk of the county shall cause a notice of such referendum to be published in some newspaper published or having a general circulation in the county once a week for three successive weeks prior to such referendum and shall post a copy of such notice during the same time at the front door of the courthouse of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of such petition, the Board of Supervisors of Isle of Wight County or Roanoke County may cause to be passed a resolution requesting that such referendum be held; provided that prior to the passage of such resolution the Board of Supervisors shall hold a public hearing on the question of such referendum.
      The resolution shall be filed with the circuit court and upon receipt thereof, the court shall proceed as in the case of a petition.

       If a majority of the qualified voters voting in such referendum vote in favor of changing the method of selecting school board members to direct election by the voters, then the members of the school board shall be elected by popular vote. Elections of school board members in a county, city, or town shall be held to coincide with the elections for members of the governing body of the county, city, or town at the regular general election in November or the regular general election in May, as the case may be.

       The initial elected board shall consist of the same number of members as the appointed school board it replaces, and the members shall be elected from the established county or municipal election districts, at large, or a combination thereof, on the same basis as the school board previously was appointed. If the appointed school board being replaced has not been appointed either on an at-large basis or on the basis of the established county or municipal election districts, or a combination thereof, the members shall be elected at large unless the governing body of the county, city, or town provides for the election of school board members on the basis of the established county or municipal election districts. If the appointed school board being replaced has been appointed at large, the governing body of the county, city, or town may establish school election districts for the election of school board members. The governing body may provide for a locality-wide district, one or more districts comprised of a part of the locality, or any combination thereof, and for the apportionment of one or more school board members to any district.The terms of the members of the elected school board for any county, city, or town shall be the same as the terms of the members of the governing body for the county, city, or town. In any locality in which both the school board and the governing body are elected from election districts, as opposed to being elected wholly on an at-large basis, the elections of the school board member and governing body member from each specific district shall be held simultaneously except as otherwise provided in §§ 22.1-57.3:1, 22.1-57.3:1.1, and 22.1-57.3:1.2.At the first election for members of the school board, so many members shall be elected as there are members to be elected at the regular election for the governing body. At each subsequent regular election for members of the governing body, the same number of members of the school board shall be elected as the number of members to be elected at the regular election to the governing body. However, if the number of members on the school board differs from the number of members of the governing body, the number of members elected to the school board at the first and subsequent general election shall be either more or less than the number of governing body members, as appropriate, to the end that the number of members on the initial elected school board is the same as the number of members on the appointed board being replaced.Except as provided in §§ 22.1-57.3:1, 22.1-57.3:1.1, and 22.1-57.3:1.2, the terms of the members of the school board shall be staggered only if the terms of the members of the governing body are staggered. If there are more, or fewer, members on the school board than on the governing body, the number of members to be elected to the school board at the first and subsequent election for school board members shall be the number required to establish the staggered term structure so that (i) a majority of the members of the school board is elected at the same time as a majority of the members of the governing body; (ii) if one-half of the governing body is being elected and the school board has an even number of members, one-half of the members of the school board is elected; (iii) if one-half of the governing body is being elected and the school board has an odd number of members, the majority by one member of the school board is elected at the first election and the remainder of the school board is elected at the second election; or (iv) if a majority of the members of the governing body is being elected and the school board has an even number of members, one-half of the members of the school board is elected.If the school board is elected at large and the terms of the members of the school board are staggered, the school board members to be replaced at the first election shall include all appointed school board members whose appointive terms are scheduled to expire on December 31 or on June 30, as the case may be, next following the first election of county, city or town school board members. If the number of school board members whose appointive terms are so scheduled to expire is zero or less than the number of school board members to be elected at the first election, the appointed school board members to be replaced at the first election shall also include those whose appointive terms are scheduled to expire next subsequent to the date on which the terms of office of the first elected school board members will commence. If the appointive terms of more than one school board member are scheduled to expire simultaneously, but less than all of such members are to be replaced at the first election, then the identity of such school board member or members to be replaced at the first election shall be determined by a drawing held by the county or city electoral board at least ten days prior to the last day for a person to qualify as a candidate for school board member.In any case in which school board members are elected from election districts, as opposed to being elected from the county, city, or town at large, the election districts for the school board shall be coterminous with the election districts for the county, city, or town governing body, except as may be specifically provided for the election of school board members in a county, city, or town in which the governing body is elected at large.

       School boards partake of the sovereignty of the State with regard to immunity from tort liability. Kellam v. School Bd.,

      <p>
       The fact that this section provides that school boards “may sue” and “be sued” does not affect their governmental immunity for tortious personal injury. Kellam v. School Bd.,

       In a case in which a reporter asserted a state law claim for defamation against a county school board, the board was immune from suit for tort claims, which included the reporter’s defamation claim. Cole v. Buchanan County Sch. Bd., 661 F. Supp. 2d 569, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101811 (W.D. Va. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which a reporter sued a county board of education for monetary damages and injunctive relief, asserting that they had violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by retaliating against him for publicly criticizing the board and its members, the board unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment, arguing that it could not be sued for damages by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment. A judgment would not have to be paid from the state’s treasury; while the board received money from the state and it had to follow statewide rules regarding aspects of course curriculum or annual budgets, those factors did not shift the balance toward a finding of sovereign immunity. Cole v. Buchanan County Sch. Bd., 661 F. Supp. 2d 569, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101811 (W.D. Va. 2009).

      <p>
       Local governing bodies, including school boards and municipal officials in their official capacities, can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief when alleged unconstitutional action executes governmental policy or custom. Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether viewed as arms of the county or state government or as independent subdivisions of the State, county school boards are not “persons” within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and are not proper defendants in a suit under that statute and its jurisdictional counterpart. Likewise, for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 purposes, there is no distinction in principle between a county school board and the persons in their official capacities of whom it is comprised. Jones v. Dinwiddie County Sch. Bd., 373 F. Supp. 1105, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9026 (E.D. Va. 1974). But see Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992).

       Summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed as the city could not be required to fund a federal court order mandating the system-wide retrofitting of city schools, under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 12131-34, without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities; to impose a funding obligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability disrespected the long-standing structure of local government and impaired the Commonwealth’s ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools. The settlement terms ultimately reached by plaintiffs and the school board as a result of arms-length negotiation were obligations on the school board’s part and it could present whatever ADA duties it had, not only to the city, but also to other funding entities.

       A School Board’s policy, which states that if “considerable work or time is required to generate information requested from the administration by a Board Member,” then the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA) request must be denied unless the full Board endorses the request, is in conflict with VFOIA. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clinton Jenkins, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 20-036,

        Power to bargain collectively not conferred on local boards. —

      <p>
       Recent Virginia history of public employee collective bargaining is persuasive, if not conclusive, that the General Assembly, the source of legislative intent with regard to the powers of boards to enter into contracts and to hire employees and fix the terms and conditions of their employment, has never conferred upon local boards, by implication or otherwise, the power to bargain collectively and that express statutory authority, so far withheld, is necessary to confer the power.

      <p>
       To the extent that the policies of a county board and school board permit collective bargaining and collective bargaining agreements with recognized labor organizations, the policies are invalid, and because the contracts entered into are the products of such collective bargaining, the agreements are void.

Therefore, a parent did not have standing to file a lawsuit against a city school board under this statute because her child no longer was a student there; moreover, the parent did not fall within an exception to the mootness and standing bar because she did not show that she would have been subjected to the alleged illegality again.

       General Assembly created a thirty-day statute of limitations for the limited class of plaintiffs to bring an action, and while this may seem harsh or unduly restrictive, it is within the authority of the General Assembly to create a truncated time period; it is not within the court’s authority to change the time period or to create exceptions; the General Assembly determined that schools function most efficiently when perceived wrongs are promptly brought to the attention of the school boards.

       Demurrers of a school board and its superintendent were sustained since all that was required for the vote was that it be held in an open meeting and it not be secret, and the claims against the superintendent were not sufficiently pled to show how he acted unlawfully by implementing the policies of the School Board, and a party was allowed to file suit only against a school board, not the superintendent.

     <p>
      The Department shall include in the annual School Performance Report Card for school divisions the percentage of each division’s annual operating budget allocated to instructional costs. For this purpose, the Department shall (i) establish a methodology for allocating each school division’s expenditures to instructional and noninstructional costs in a manner that, except in the case of the hardware necessary to support electronic textbooks, is consistent with the funding of the Standards of Quality as approved by the General Assembly and (ii) allocate to instructional costs each school division’s expenditures on the hardware necessary to support electronic textbooks. Further, at the discretion of the Superintendent, the Department may also report on other methods of measuring instructional spending such as those used by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Education.

       If the local governing body made a lump sum appropriation to the school board for fiscal year 2011-2012 and a surplus resulted from debt service savings, then the school board may reallocate and spend those savings for other school needs. The question of whether a lump sum appropriation was made to the local school board depends upon the interpretation of a local ordinance, a practice from which this office has traditionally abstained.

      <p>
       A federal court ordinarily has no right or power to interfere with appropriations made by a city council for use by the school board. There is, however, an exception to this rule where the purpose and intent of council is clearly to flaunt the law of the land and avoid the effect of lawful court orders by participating in a scheme or device to attain its objective.

        Withholding of funds from certain schools and grades. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The appropriation ordinance of the City of Norfolk for the year 1959 made appropriations for the public schools on a tentative basis, as authorized by former § 22-127 as amended in 1956 and before its amendment in 1959, and provided that no part of the funds so appropriated should be available to the school board except as the council might by resolution authorize. A subsequent resolution authorized the transfer of a certain sum to the school board but stipulated that “no part of said sum shall be disbursed for the normal daytime operation of the schools now under the control of the Governor of Virginia without his prior approval.” A second resolution declared that the council would not thereafter authorize the transfer to the school board for the maintenance and operation of any grade higher than the sixth grade of any part of the funds tentatively appropriated. The federal district court enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance and resolutions, holding that the action of the council in adopting them was tantamount to an evasive scheme or device seeking to perpetuate the program of massive resistance in the public schools of the city, and that they violated the laws of Virginia, as well as the laws and Constitution of the United States.

       If the local governing body made a lump sum appropriation to the school board for fiscal year 2011-2012 and a surplus resulted from debt service savings, then the school board may reallocate and spend those savings for other school needs. The question of whether a lump sum appropriation was made to the local school board depends upon the interpretation of a local ordinance, a practice from which this office has traditionally abstained.

       The county school board has special authority to borrow funds under this section, and authority to borrow for the county is not lodged in the county treasurer but generally in the board of supervisors under former § 15.1-545. Banks are bound to take notice of the limitation upon the treasurer’s authority, and hence they have knowledge that he was acting outside the scope of his official duty when he told them that he was borrowing money for public purposes to be paid back when the subsequent collections would put the county in funds.

     <p>
      In cases where funds or other property are held by trustees for purposes of public school education, a school board shall have the power and duty to examine into the manner in which such trusts are administered. All such trustees shall render reports to the school board whenever called on and afford every facility needed by the school board to obtain a full understanding of all the points connected with such administration. If such examination reveals any defect or irregularity in the administration of such trust funds or other property, it shall be the duty of the school board to institute prompt proceedings for carrying the matter before the courts. In cases where donations or other funds have been set apart for the education of the poor, a school board is authorized to receive and apply the same in connection with the public schools in obedience to the will of the donor. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to the twenty-fifth clause of the will of Samuel Miller, deceased, or in anywise to affect or impair any rights or interests whatsoever, either public or private, arising under such clause.

       Summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed as the city could not be required to fund a federal court order mandating the system-wide retrofitting of city schools, under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 12131-34, without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities; to impose a funding obligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability disrespected the long-standing structure of local government and impaired the Commonwealth’s ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools. The settlement terms ultimately reached by plaintiffs and the school board as a result of arms-length negotiation were obligations on the school board’s part and it could present whatever ADA duties it had, not only to the city, but also to other funding entities.

     <p>
      The Department of Education shall make information available to school boards on integrated pest management programs that appropriately address the application of chemical pesticides and other pest control measures on school property. For purposes of this section, “integrated pest management” shall mean a managed pest control and suppression program that uses various integrated methods to keep pests from causing economic, health-related, or aesthetic injury and minimizes the use of pesticides and the risk to human health and the environment associated with pesticide applications. Methods may include the utilization of site or pest inspections, pest population monitoring, evaluation of control requirements, and the use of one or more pest control methods including sanitation, structural repair, nonchemical methods, and pesticides when nontoxic options produce unsatisfactory results or are impractical. Each local school division shall maintain documentation of any pesticide application that includes the target pest, the formulation applied, and the specific location of the application. The guidelines and programs adopted pursuant to this section shall permit the immediate application of pesticides or other effective control measures to eradicate pest infestations that pose an acute danger to students and staff.

     <p>
      Whenever a school board desires to contract with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System to borrow money for capital projects for school purposes, it shall adopt a resolution setting forth the purpose for which it is desired to borrow the money and the amount of such proposed borrowing. Such resolution shall be entered in the minutes of the school board, and a copy of the same, certified by the clerk of the school board, shall be submitted by the school board to the governing body of the county, city or town for its approval or rejection. If the governing body approves the resolution, it shall enter its approval in its minutes, and the school board may then endeavor to negotiate an agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System for the borrowing of such money. If agreement is reached, the question of borrowing such money on the terms agreed upon by the school board and the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System shall again be submitted to the governing body of the county, city or town for its approval or rejection. If the governing body approves the terms of the agreement, it shall enter its approval in its minutes, and the school board may then, by resolution entered in its minutes, provide for the issuance of negotiable bonds evidencing the indebtedness for sale to the Virginia Retirement System. Such bonds shall be issued in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

      The Authority is authorized to purchase local school bonds with any funds of the Authority available for such purpose, at public or private sale and for such price and on such terms as it shall determine. The Authority may pledge to the payment of the interest on and the principal of any bonds of the Authority all or any part of the local school bonds so purchased, including payments of principal and interest thereon as they shall become due. The Authority may also, subject to any such pledge, sell any such local school bonds so purchased and apply the proceeds of such sale in the purchase of other like local school bonds or for such purpose and in such manner as shall be provided by any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds of the Authority, or the Authority may transfer such proceeds to the Literary Fund. For the purpose of Article VII, Section 10(b) of the Constitution of Virginia, the Authority shall be deemed a state agency authorized to purchase bonds issued with the consent of the school board and the governing body of the county by or on behalf of a county or district thereof for capital projects for school purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, any city completely surrounded by a county having the urban county executive form of government may finance capital projects for school purposes through the Authority without the requirement of a voter referendum if the financing for the capital project is requested by both the city council and the school board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of all local school bonds issued pursuant to this chapter prior to July 1, 1975, may be used for any capital project for public schools as provided in the resolution by which their issuance was authorized.

       Issuance of bonds of Authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to provide funds for the purchase of local school bonds as authorized by § 22.1-166, to provide funds for the making of loans to local school boards as authorized by § 22.1-166.1, or to provide funds for the making of grants to local school boards as authorized by § 22.1-166.2, the Board of Commissioners is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of bonds of the Authority in such amount or amounts as the Board of Commissioners shall determine.
      Such bonds of the Authority shall be payable solely from funds of the Authority, including, without limitation, all or any combination of the following sources:
      (i) payments of principal of and interest on local school bonds purchased by the Authority, (ii) the proceeds of the sale of any such local school bonds, (iii) payments of principal of and interest on obligations transferred to the Authority from the Literary Fund, (iv) the proceeds of the sale of any such obligations, (v) any moneys transferred to the Authority from the Literary Fund, (vi) payments of principal of and interest on loans made to local school boards, and (vii) any funds authorized by the General Assembly from the Literary Fund or otherwise appropriated by the General Assembly, as shall be provided by the resolution of the Board of Commissioners authorizing any such bonds. Bonds of the Authority issued under the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the Commonwealth or a pledge of the faith or credit of the Commonwealth, and all bonds of the Authority shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof is or shall be pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest and shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding thirty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Board of Commissioners and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board of Commissioners, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board of Commissioners prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The Board of Commissioners shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at the office of the State Treasurer or at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form or both, as the Board of Commissioners may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. The Board of Commissioners may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or at private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority. The proceeds of such bonds shall be disbursed for the purposes for which such bonds were issued under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture provided for in § 22.1-171 may provide. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Board of Commissioners may under like restrictions issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Board of Commissioners may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Such bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than the proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified and required by this chapter.

       Even if the court were to accept the student’s argument that the accident occurred during the unloading process, based on the facts, the Powell test, and other cases, the accident did not result from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the bus; the accident occurred after the bus driver removed the student from the bus, when he was on the sidewalk. The bus, at best, was merely the situs of the accident; therefore, there was no valid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of under § 22.1-194 and the county school board retained its immunity.

       The General Assembly finds that Virginia educational research supports the conclusion that poor children are more at risk of educational failure than children from more affluent homes and that reduced pupil/teacher ratios and class sizes result in improved academic performance among young children; to this end, the General Assembly establishes a long-term goal of reducing pupil/teacher ratios and class sizes for grades K through three in those schools in the Commonwealth with high or moderate concentrations of at-risk students.
       <p>
        With such funds as are provided in the appropriation act for this purpose, there is hereby established the statewide voluntary pupil/teacher ratio and class size reduction program for the purpose of reaching the long-term goal of statewide voluntary pupil/teacher ratio and class size reductions for grades K through three in schools with high or moderate concentrations of at-risk students, consistent with the provisions provided in the appropriation act.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to facilitate these primary grade ratio and class size reductions, the Department shall calculate the state funding of these voluntary ratio and class size reductions based on the incremental cost of providing the lower class sizes according to the greater of the division average per-pupil cost of all divisions or the actual division per-pupil cost. Localities shall provide matching funds for these voluntary ratio and class size reductions based on the composite index of local ability to pay. School divisions shall notify the Department of their intention to implement the reduced ratios and class sizes in one or more of their qualifying schools by August 1 of each year. By March 31 of each year, school divisions shall forward data substantiating that each participating school has a complying pupil/teacher ratio.
       </p>
       <p>
        In developing each proposed biennium budget for public education, the Board shall include funding for these ratios and class sizes. These ratios and class sizes shall be included in the annual budget for public education.

       The General Assembly finds that educational technology is one of the most important components, along with highly skilled teachers, in ensuring the delivery of quality public school education throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Board shall strive to incorporate technological studies within the teaching of all disciplines. Further, the General Assembly notes that educational technology can only be successful if teachers and administrators are provided adequate training and assistance. To this end, the following program is established.
       <p>
        With such funds as are appropriated for this purpose, the Board shall award to the several school divisions grants for expanded access to educational technology. Funding for educational technology training for instructional personnel shall be provided as set forth in the appropriation act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funds for improving the quality and capacity of educational technology shall also be provided as set forth in the appropriation act, including (i) funds for providing a technology resource assistant to serve every elementary school in this Commonwealth and (ii) funds to maintain the currency of career and technical education programs. Any local school board accepting funds to hire technology resource assistants or maintain currency of career and technical education programs shall commit to providing the required matching funds, based on the composite index of local ability to pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each qualifying school board shall establish an individualized technology plan, which shall be approved by the Superintendent, for integrating technology into the classroom and into schoolwide instructional programs, including career and technical education programs. The first priority for funding shall be consistent with those components of the Board’s revised six-year technology plan that focus on (i) retrofitting and upgrading existing school buildings to efficiently use educational technology; (ii) providing (a) one network-ready multimedia microcomputer for each classroom, (b) a five-to-one ratio of pupils to network-ready microcomputers, (c) graphing calculators and relevant scientific probes/sensors as required by the Standards of Learning, and (d) training and professional development on available technologies and software to all levels and positions, including professional development for personnel delivering career and technical education at all levels and positions; and (iii) assisting school divisions in developing integrated voice-, video-, and data-connectivity to local, national and international resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding may be used to implement a local school division’s long-range technology plan, at the discretion of the relevant school board, if the local plan meets or exceeds the goals and standards of the Board’s revised six-year technology plan and has been approved by the Superintendent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Education, the Department of General Services, and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency shall coordinate master contracts for the purchase by local school boards of the aforementioned educational technologies and reference materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        A technology replacement program shall be, with such funds as may be appropriated for this purpose, implemented to replace obsolete educational hardware and software. As provided in subsection D of § 22.1-129, school boards may donate obsolete educational technology hardware and software that are being replaced. Any such donations shall be offered to other school divisions and to preschool programs in the Commonwealth or to public school students as provided in guidelines to be promulgated by the Board. Such guidelines shall include criteria for determining student eligibility and need, a reporting system for the compilation of information concerning the number and socioeconomic characteristics of recipient students, and notification of parents of the availability of such donations of obsolete educational hardware and software.

       The General Assembly finds that local autonomy in making decisions on local educational needs and priorities results in effective grassroots efforts to improve education in the Commonwealth’s public schools only when coupled with sufficient state funding; to this end, the following block grant program is hereby established. With such funds as are provided in the appropriation act, the Department shall distribute block grants to localities to enable compliance with the Commonwealth’s requirements for school divisions in effect on January 1, 1995. Therefore, for the purpose of such compliance, the block grant herein established shall consist of a sum equal to the amount appropriated in the appropriation act for the covered programs, including the at-risk add-on program; dropout prevention, specifically Project YES; Project Discovery; English as a second language programs, including programs for overage, nonschooled students; Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID); the Homework Assistance Program; programs initiated under the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program, except that such funds shall not be used to pay any expenses of participating students at institutions of higher education; and school/community health centers.

      In lieu of §§ 22.1-277, 22.1-277.07, and 22.1-277.08, a school board may establish optional age-appropriate education programs for young students in grades kindergarten through five who require guidance, supervision, and discipline in a structured learning environment and who need to be redirected toward appropriate classroom decorum and acceptable personal behavior. The programs shall provide instructional and support services that will enable students to maintain academic achievement, attain basic skills and academic proficiencies, and otherwise benefit from a public education during the time that they may be removed from the regular classroom. The programs shall also be designed to accommodate students within the school building to which they have been assigned, facilitate the efficient transition of students between the optional education program and their regular classroom, and provide for the continuity of instruction, a nurturing environment, necessary guidance and supervision, and the participation of the student’s parents in correcting his behavior. Such programs shall be adequately staffed by licensed teachers or other persons with demonstrated qualifications to instruct and manage students with a range of academic gifts and deficiencies, disciplinary problems, and the need to develop and use appropriate social skills.

       Subsection C of § 22.1-202, mandating the recitation of the pledge of allegiance in public schools, did not violate the Establishment Clause of U.S. Const. amend. I as applied to the father’s children because the school’s citizenship reward program considered a student’s recitation of the pledge as merely one element in determining whether the student received an award, the children were not psychologically coerced into accepting particular religious views authorized by the school nor were they punished by having to listen to others reciting the pledge.

      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment Clause works to bar sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity; the Pledge of Allegiance, which is not a religious exercise, posed none of those harms and did not amount to an establishment of religion. Accordingly, subsection C, requiring daily, voluntary, recitation of the pledge in the classrooms of Virginia’s public schools was constitutional. Myers v. Loudoun County Pub.

The purpose of the character education program shall be to instill in students civic virtues and personal character traits so as to improve the learning environment, promote student achievement, reduce disciplinary problems, and develop civic-minded students of high character. The components of each program shall be developed in cooperation with the students, their parents, and the community at large. The basic character traits taught may include (i) trustworthiness, including honesty, integrity, reliability, and loyalty; (ii) respect, including the precepts of the Golden Rule, tolerance, and courtesy; (iii) responsibility, including hard work, economic self-reliance, accountability, diligence, perseverance, and self-control; (iv) fairness, including justice, consequences of bad behavior, principles of nondiscrimination, and freedom from prejudice; (v) caring, including kindness, empathy, compassion, consideration, generosity, and charity; and (vi) citizenship, including patriotism, the Pledge of Allegiance, respect for the American flag, concern for the common good, respect for authority and the law, and community-mindedness.Classroom instruction may be used to supplement a character education program; however, each program shall be interwoven into the school procedures and environment and structured to instruct primarily through example, illustration, and participation, in such a way as to complement the Standards of Learning.

      Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amending their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

      <b>
       Contractual authority of public charter school. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A public charter school is authorized to contract with a local school board, an institution of higher education, or a third party for the use of a building and grounds; however, if a proposed contractual arrangement between a school board and a limited liability company formed by a participant in an application for a charter school violates the State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act, the public charter school laws do not authorize the Board of Education to grant a waiver. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John A. Rollison, III, Member, House of Delegates, 03-041 (8/19/03).

      Provision of the charter agreement that requires a charter school to expend funds in order to make the building compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act as a precondition to opening its doors does not conflict with subsection D of § 22.1-212.14. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Joseph D. Morrissey, Member, House of Delegates, 10-010, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 9 (3/4/10).

     <p>
      The provision of the charter school agreement that requires that certain “start-up” costs be paid out of private funds raised by the school and not from the per-student state and local funding allocated to the school by the school board does not conflict with subsection D of § 22.1-212.14.

     <p>
      There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Public Charter School Fund, hereafter referred to as “the Fund.” The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. Any gifts, grants, bequests, or donations from public or private sources shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund.

Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purposes of establishing or supporting public charter schools in the Commonwealth that stimulate the development of alternative public education programs. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Board of Education shall establish criteria for making distributions from the Fund to a public charter school requesting moneys from the Fund and may issue guidelines governing the Fund as it deems necessary and appropriate.

       Review of a decision by a hearing officer concerning a special education program for a handicapped child is not subject to the Administrative Process Act. Rather, it is subject to the provisions of subsection D. This section allows the court to hear additional evidence and requires it to weigh the evidence and base its decisions on the preponderance of the evidence, instead of simply finding substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officer’s decision.

        Determination of need for residential placement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Analysis of the issue of residential placement must focus on whether full-time placement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the residential placement is a response to medical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the learning process. The relevant inquiry is whether a residential placement is a necessary ingredient for learning. Martin v. School Bd., 3 Va. App. 197, 348 S.E.2d 857, 3 Va. Law Rep. 772, 1986

      <p>
       Where the child’s disability manifested itself in emotional outbursts and occasional acts of violence at school and at home, his emotional disability intruded on the learning process and frustrated the instructional efforts outlined in various individualized education programs, making it possible to conclude that a residential placement would provide greater educational benefit than he received in the special education classes, but he made significant progress in the special education classes, and the court could not conclude from the record that this case presented a situation in which a residential setting was the only educational placement “reasonably calculated to enable (the child) to receive educational benefits,” residential placement was not required.

       Because unapproved private schools do not meet state educational standards adopted by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Education of the Handicapped Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., does not require Virginia school systems to place and fund handicapped children in unapproved private schools.

      This section was contingently repealed by Acts 1993, c. 654. Acts 1993, c. 654, which repealed this section, in cl. 3, provided that the provisions of the 1993 act shall become effective on July 1, 1994, provided the 1994 General Assembly appropriated funds sufficient to cover the state share of such textbooks and workbooks. Sufficient funds were appropriated by the 1994 Session of the General Assembly; therefore, the repeal of this section is effective July 1, 1994.

       The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of the Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia.

       The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core of Virginia’s educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in §

       .
       
        The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
       

        The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension.
       

        The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis.
       

        To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
       

        In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
       

        School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board’s requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
       

        The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, “diverse” includes consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender.
       

        The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for health instruction in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator, including hands-on practice of the skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such instruction shall be based on the current national evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross. No teacher who is in compliance with subdivision D 3 of § 22.1-298.1 shall be required to be certified as a trainer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to provide instruction for non-certification.
       <p>
        With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board shall establish content standards and curriculum guidelines for courses in career investigation in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Each school board shall (i) require each middle school student to take at least one course in career investigation or (ii) select an alternate means of delivering the career investigation course to each middle school student, provided that such alternative is equivalent in content and rigor and provides the foundation for such students to develop their academic and career plans. Any school board may require (a) such courses in career investigation at the high school level as it deems appropriate, subject to Board approval as required in subsection A of § 22.1-253.13:4, and (b) such courses in career investigation at the elementary school level as it deems appropriate. The Board shall develop and disseminate to each school board career investigation resource materials that are designed to ensure that students have the ability to further explore interest in career and technical education opportunities in middle and high school. In developing such resource materials, the Board shall consult with representatives of career and technical education, industry, skilled trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar organizations, and contractor organizations.

       Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and related technology, computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education, environmental issues, and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.

        Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are research-based.

Division superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student’s attendance in a program of prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the student’s parent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth’s share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2.

       While defendants would not qualify as employees of the Prince George County High School, under Virginia’s State Government Volunteers Act, all three defendants enjoyed sovereign immunity to the same extent as normal employees of the school board would because defendants were engaged in instructional activities regarding baseball batting skills, and exercised judgment and discretion in so instructing; the school board funded and operated the baseball team in accordance with this statute, which included a program of physical activity available to all students; and the degree of control and direction exercised by the state over the employee was illustrated by the school board’s creation of the team and their funding and operation of the team.

       The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of the Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia.
      </li>
      <li id="t22.1c13.2s22.1-253.13:1.01ol1B">
       The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core of Virginia’s educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in §
       <cite class="ocva">

        </a>
       </cite>
       .
       
        The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
       

        The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension.
       

        The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis.
       

        To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
       

        In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
       

        School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board’s requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
       

        The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, “diverse” includes consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender.
       

        The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for health instruction in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator, including hands-on practice of the skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such instruction shall be based on the current national evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross. No teacher who is in compliance with subdivision D 3 of § 22.1-298.1 shall be required to be certified as a trainer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to provide instruction for non-certification.
       <p>
        With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board shall establish content standards and curriculum guidelines for courses in career investigation in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Each school board shall (i) require each middle school student to take at least one course in career investigation or (ii) select an alternate means of delivering the career investigation course to each middle school student, provided that such alternative is equivalent in content and rigor and provides the foundation for such students to develop their academic and career plans. Any school board may require (a) such courses in career investigation at the high school level as it deems appropriate, subject to Board approval as required in subsection A of § 22.1-253.13:4, and (b) such courses in career investigation at the elementary school level as it deems appropriate. The Board shall develop and disseminate to each school board career investigation resource materials that are designed to ensure that students have the ability to further explore interest in career and technical education opportunities in middle and high school. In developing such resource materials, the Board shall consult with representatives of career and technical education, industry, skilled trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar organizations, and contractor organizations.

       Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and related technology, computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education, environmental issues, and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.
       <p>
        Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are research-based.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a remediation program.

        Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student’s attendance in a program of prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the student’s parent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth’s share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2.

        The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation of public virtual schools under the authority of the local school board that enroll students full time.
       

        The Board’s regulations establishing standards for accreditation shall ensure that the accreditation process is transparent and based on objective measurements and that any appeal of the accreditation status of a school is heard and decided by the Board.
       

        The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth. The Board shall review the accreditation status of a school once every three years if the school has been fully accredited for three consecutive years. Upon such triennial review, the Board shall review the accreditation status of the school for each individual year within that triennial review period. If the Board finds that the school would have been accredited every year of that triennial review period the Board shall accredit the school for another three years. The Board may review the accreditation status of any other school once every two years or once every three years, provided that any school that receives a multiyear accreditation status other than full accreditation shall be covered by a Board-approved multiyear corrective action plan for the duration of the period of accreditation. Such multiyear corrective action plan shall include annual written progress updates to the Board. A multiyear accreditation status shall not relieve any school or division of annual reporting requirements.
       

        Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as prescribed by the Board. Each local school board shall report the accreditation status of all schools in the local school division annually in public session.
       

        The Board shall establish a review process to assist any school that does not meet the standards established by the Board. The relevant school board shall report the results of such review and any annual progress reports in public session and shall implement any actions identified through such review and utilize them for improvement planning.
       

        The Board shall establish a corrective action plan process for any school that does not meet the standards established by the Board. Such process shall require (a) each school board to submit a corrective action plan for any school in the local school division that does not meet the standards established by the Board and (b) any school board that fails to demonstrate progress in developing or implementing any such corrective action plan to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Board.
       

        When the Board determines through its review process that the failure of schools within a division to meet the standards established by the Board is related to division-level failure to implement the Standards of Quality or other division-level action or inaction, the Board may require a division-level academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time specified by the Board, each school board shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Board and shall subsequently submit to the Board for approval a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria established by the Board setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school division meet the standards established by the Board. If the Board determines that the proposed corrective action plan is not sufficient to enable all schools within the division to meet the standards established by the Board, the Board may return the plan to the local school board with directions to submit an amended plan pursuant to Board guidance. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division’s comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.

       The Superintendent shall develop, subject to revision by the Board, criteria for determining and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth’s local school divisions and public schools. The portion of such criteria that measures individual student growth shall become an integral part of the accreditation process for schools in which any grade level in the grade three through eight range is taught. The Superintendent shall annually report to the Board on the accreditation status of all school divisions and schools. Such report shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance and individual student growth in the school divisions, the Board shall include consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments and students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor’s Schools.
       <p>
        The Superintendent shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing educational performance and individual student growth in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria.

       With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board shall prescribe assessment methods to determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall, with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments. In lieu of a one-time end-of-year assessment, the Board shall establish, for the purpose of providing measures of individual student growth over the course of the school year, a through-year growth assessment system, aligned with the Standards of Learning, for the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in grades three through eight. Such through-year growth assessment system shall include at least one beginning-of-year, one mid-year, and one end-of-year assessment in order to provide individual student growth scores over the course of the school year, but the total time scheduled for taking all such assessments shall not exceed 150 percent of the time scheduled for taking a single end-of-year proficiency assessment. The Department shall ensure adequate training for teachers and principals on how to interpret and use student growth data from such assessments to improve reading and mathematics instruction in grades three through eight throughout the school year. With such funds and content as are available for such purpose, such through-year growth assessment system shall provide accurate measurement of a student’s performance, through computer adaptive technology, using test items at, below, and above the student’s grade level as necessary.
       <p>
        The Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected credit.

        The Board shall prescribe alternative methods of Standards of Learning assessment administration for children with disabilities, as that term is defined in § 22.1-213, who meet criteria established by the Board to demonstrate achievement of the Standards of Learning. An eligible student’s Individual Education Program team shall make the final determination as to whether an alternative method of administration is appropriate for the student.

        The Board shall include in the student outcome and growth measures that are required by the standards of accreditation the required assessments for various grade levels and classes, including the completion of the alternative assessments implemented by each local school board, in accordance with the Standards of Learning. These assessments shall include end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science and may be integrated to include multiple subject areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Standards of Learning assessments administered to students in grades three through eight shall not exceed (i) reading and mathematics in grades three and four; (ii) reading, mathematics, and science in grade five; (iii) reading and mathematics in grades six and seven; (iv) reading, writing, and mathematics in grade eight; (v) science after the student receives instruction in the grade six science, life science, and physical science Standards of Learning and before the student completes grade eight; and (vi) Virginia Studies and Civics and Economics once each at the grade levels deemed appropriate by each local school board. The reading and mathematics assessments administered to students in grades three through eight shall be through-year growth assessments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each school board shall annually certify that it has provided instruction and administered an alternative assessment, consistent with Board guidelines, to students in grades three through eight in each Standards of Learning subject area in which a Standards of Learning assessment was not administered during the school year. Such guidelines shall (a) incorporate options for age-appropriate, authentic performance assessments and portfolios with rubrics and other methodologies designed to ensure that students are making adequate academic progress in the subject area and that the Standards of Learning content is being taught; (b) permit and encourage integrated assessments that include multiple subject areas; and (c) emphasize collaboration between teachers to administer and substantiate the assessments and the professional development of teachers to enable them to make the best use of alternative assessments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local school divisions shall provide targeted mathematics remediation and intervention to students in grades six through eight who show computational deficiencies as demonstrated by their individual performance on any diagnostic test or grade-level Standards of Learning mathematics test that measures non-calculator computational skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department shall award recovery credit to any student in grades three through eight who performs below grade level on a Standards of Learning assessment in English reading or mathematics, receives remediation, and subsequently retakes and performs at or above grade level on such an assessment, including any such student who subsequently retakes such an assessment on an expedited basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board shall (1) develop appropriate assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and other assessment instruments that may be used by classroom teachers; (2) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations; and (3) prescribe and provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Standards of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a preparation program for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board or in an adult basic education program or an adult secondary education program to obtain the high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department shall develop processes for informing school divisions of changes in the Standards of Learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any Standards of Learning test or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the Standards of Learning content or assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Board shall not include in its calculation of the passage rate for a Standards of Learning assessment or the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives for an individual student growth assessment for the purposes of state accountability any student whose parent has decided to not have his child take such Standards of Learning assessment, unless such exclusions would result in the school’s not meeting any required state or federal participation rate.

       Discrimination. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amending their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Adam P. Ebbin, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-080, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 9 (3/4/15).

       School safety. —

      Virginia law authorizes school resource officers and certain school security officers to possess firearms on public school grounds as school safety personnel, but such authority is not extended to teachers and administrators.

     <p>
      Each local school board shall provide, as a minimum, the programs and services, as provided in the Standards of Quality prescribed above, with state and local funds as apportioned by the General Assembly in the appropriation act and to the extent funding is provided by the General Assembly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each local school board shall report its compliance with the Standards of Quality to the Board of Education annually. The report of compliance shall be submitted to the Board of Education by the chairman of the local school board and the division superintendent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Noncompliance with the Standards of Quality shall be included in the Board of Education’s annual report to the Governor and the General Assembly as required by § 22.1-18.
     </p>
     <p>
      As required by § 22.1-18, the Board of Education shall submit to the Governor and the General Assembly a report on the condition and needs of public education in the Commonwealth and shall identify any school divisions and the specific schools therein that have failed to establish and maintain schools meeting the existing prescribed Standards of Quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board of Education shall have authority to seek school division compliance with the foregoing Standards of Quality. When the Board of Education determines that a school division has failed or refused, and continues to fail or refuse, to comply with any such Standard, the Board may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division to mandate or otherwise enforce compliance with such standard, including the development or implementation of any required corrective action plan that a local school board has failed or refused to develop or implement in a timely manner.

        Except as otherwise provided in this article, every parent, guardian, or other person in the Commonwealth having control or charge of any child who will have reached the fifth birthday on or before September 30 of any school year and who has not passed the eighteenth birthday shall, during the period of each year the public schools are in session and for the same number of days and hours per day as the public schools, cause such child to attend a public school or a private, denominational, or parochial school or have such child taught by a tutor or teacher of qualifications prescribed by the Board and approved by the division superintendent, or provide for home instruction of such child as described in § 22.1-254.1.

Further, in the case of any five-year-old child who is subject to the provisions of this subsection, the requirements of this section may be alternatively satisfied by causing the child to attend any public educational pre-kindergarten program, including a Head Start program, or in a private, denominational, or parochial educational pre-kindergarten program.

       This section is not limited to mandatory enrollment; while neither this section, nor any other statute in the compulsory attendance law, mentions tardiness, tardiness falls within the term absent or failed to report to school as tardiness is a partial absence from school, and when a student arrives at school late, he is not present between the time school begins and the time he arrives.

       Requirement that a parent, guardian, or person having control or charge of a minor “send” that child to school requires that such child be enrolled in a school program fulfilling the requirements of this section, including that the program meet for as many days and hours each year as the public school year; while enrollment necessarily contemplates general attendance, the statute cannot be used to prosecute instances of tardiness.

       Where parents argued that both the school board and the trial court applied a two-pronged test, and that this test improperly required them to show not only that their beliefs were religious in character and were bona fide but also that the beliefs could not be accommodated by the alternatives to public school attendance available under the compulsory school attendance law, in disposing of the parents’ application for exemption, the school board did not apply the two-pronged test; furthermore, while the trial court applied the two-pronged test, it held that the parents had satisfied neither prong, and in these circumstances, the trial court’s application of the second prong was harmless error.

       It was not improper for the school board to question parents in an effort to understand their beliefs and to inquire into the practices and beliefs of other members of their church with respect to home schooling; the school board was not bound to accept without question the parents’ bald statement that their beliefs were religious in nature and sincerely held; rather, the board could properly test the bona fides of the situation by further inquiry; in determining whether the inquiry was arbitrary and capricious, the issue was not the content of the specific questions posed but whether the board departed from the appropriate standard in making its decision, and nothing in the record indicated that the board departed from the standard at any time in its deliberations.

Parents electing to provide home instruction shall provide such annual notice no later than August 15. Any parent who moves into a school division or begins home instruction after the school year has begun shall notify the division superintendent of his intention to provide home instruction as soon as practicable and shall thereafter comply with the requirements of this section within 30 days of such notice.

        In the event that evidence of progress as required in this subsection is not provided by the parent, the home instruction program for that child may be placed on probation for one year. Parents shall file with the division superintendent evidence of their ability to provide an adequate education for their child in compliance with subsection A and a remediation plan for the probationary year that indicates their program is designed to address any educational deficiency. Upon acceptance of such evidence and plan by the division superintendent, the home instruction may continue for one probationary year. If the remediation plan and evidence are not accepted or the required evidence of progress is not provided by August 1 following the probationary year, home instruction shall cease and the parent shall make other arrangements for the education of the child that comply with § 22.1-254.

       Supreme Court held that a local school board did not have the authority to adopt a policy requiring parents to provide a birth certificate and proof of residence in the county for any child who is homeschooled. The amended policy was inconsistent with § 22.1-254.1, and the school board was enjoined from enforcing the policy. Sosebee v. Franklin Cty. Sch. Bd.,

      Every school board shall have power to appoint one or more attendance officers, who shall be charged with the enforcement of the provisions of this article. Where no attendance officer is appointed by the school board, the division superintendent or his designee shall act as attendance officer.
     </p>

      Whenever any pupil fails to report to school on a regularly scheduled school day and no indication has been received by school personnel that the pupil’s parent is aware of and supports the pupil’s absence, a reasonable effort to notify by telephone the parent to obtain an explanation for the pupil’s absence shall be made by either the school principal or his designee, the attendance officer, other school personnel, or volunteers organized by the school administration for this purpose. Any such volunteers shall not be liable for any civil damages for any acts or omissions resulting from making such reasonable efforts to notify parents and obtain such explanation when such acts or omissions are taken in good faith, unless such acts or omissions were the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This subsection shall not be construed to limit, withdraw, or overturn any defense or immunity already existing in statutory or common law or to affect any claim occurring prior to the effective date of this law. School divisions are encouraged to use noninstructional personnel for this notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any pupil fails to report to school for a total of five scheduled school days for the school year and no indication has been received by school personnel that the pupil’s parent is aware of and supports the pupil’s absence, and a reasonable effort to notify the parent has failed, the school principal or his designee shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that direct contact is made with the parent in person, through telephone conversation, or through the use of other communications devices to obtain an explanation for the pupil’s absence and to explain to the parent the consequences of continued nonattendance. The school principal or his designee, the pupil, and the pupil’s parent shall jointly develop a plan to resolve the pupil’s nonattendance. Such plan shall include documentation of the reasons for the pupil’s nonattendance.

     <p>
      If the pupil is absent for more than one additional day after direct contact with the pupil’s parent, and school personnel have received no indication that the pupil’s parent is aware of and supports the pupil’s absence, the school principal or his designee shall schedule a conference with the pupil, his parent, and school personnel. Such conference may include the attendance officer and other community service providers to resolve issues related to the pupil’s nonattendance. The conference shall be held no later than 10 school days after the tenth absence of the pupil, regardless of whether his parent approves of the conference. The conference team shall monitor the pupil’s attendance and may meet again as necessary to address concerns and plan additional interventions if attendance does not improve. In circumstances in which the parent is intentionally noncompliant with compulsory attendance requirements or the pupil is resisting parental efforts to comply with compulsory attendance requirements, the principal or his designee shall make a referral to the attendance officer. The attendance officer shall schedule a conference with the pupil and his parent within 10 school days and may (i) file a complaint with the juvenile and domestic relations district court alleging the pupil is a child in need of supervision as defined in § 16.1-228 or (ii) institute proceedings against the parent pursuant to §

       This section is not limited to mandatory enrollment; while neither this section, nor any other statute in the compulsory attendance law, mentions tardiness, tardiness falls within the term absent or failed to report to school as tardiness is a partial absence from school, and when a student arrives at school late, he is not present between the time school begins and the time he arrives.

     </p>
     <p>
      Repealed § 22.1-276 was rewritten by Acts 2001, c. 668, to read: “A school board may take action against a pupil for any actual breakage or destruction of or failure to return property owned by or under the control of the school board caused or committed by such pupil in pursuit of his studies.” Section 22.1-280.4, enacted by Acts 2001, cc. 688, 820, incorporates the changes made to repealed § 22.1-276 by Acts 2001, c. 668.
     </p>
     <p>
      Former § 22.1-276, relating to liability of pupils for destruction of property, was derived from Code 1950, § 22-200; 1980, c. 559.

       Discrimination. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amending their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Adam P. Ebbin, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-080, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 9 (3/4/15).

        Right to hearing. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under due process considerations, failure on the part of school authorities to afford a hearing is not excused by later proof that the student is guilty of the offense charged. Thus, the necessity of a prompt hearing is a constitutional prerequisite despite the fact that Virginia’s statutory law appears to allow suspensions to remain in effect for a period of up to 30 days pending decision by school board. Doe v. Rockingham County Sch. Bd., 658 F. Supp. 403, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3250 (W.D. Va. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no evidence that the plaintiff voluntarily relinquished his right to a hearing, the defendants were under a duty to provide a hearing within a reasonable period of time after the date of the suspension, which would not normally exceed 72 hours. Doe v. Rockingham County Sch. Bd., 658 F. Supp. 403, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3250 (W.D. Va. 1987).

       Where under the then existing statutes the school boards of cities had power to expel pupils and there was no right of appeal to the superintendents in regard thereto, and the school boards of cities were subject to no other authority than the State School Board and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, mandamus would lie from the corporation court of the cities to the school boards to compel them to reinstate pupils wrongfully denied the privilege of attending the public free school.

     <p>
      A pupil may be suspended for not more than ten school days by either the school principal, any assistant principal, or, in their absence, any teacher. The principal, assistant principal, or teacher may suspend the pupil after giving the pupil oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the facts as known to school personnel and an opportunity to present his version of what occurred. In the case of any pupil whose presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property, or whose presence is an ongoing threat of disruption, the pupil may be removed from school immediately and the notice, explanation of facts, and opportunity to present his version shall be given as soon as practicable thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon suspension of any pupil, the principal, assistant principal, or teacher responsible for such suspension shall report the facts of the case in writing to the division superintendent or his designee and the parent of the pupil suspended. The division superintendent or his designee shall review forthwith the action taken by the principal, assistant principal, or teacher upon a petition for such review by any party in interest and confirm or disapprove such action based on an examination of the record of the pupil’s behavior.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision of the division superintendent or his designee may be appealed to the school board or a committee thereof in accordance with regulations of the school board; however, the decision of the division superintendent or his designee shall be final if so prescribed by school board regulations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The school board shall require that any oral or written notice to the parent of a student who is suspended from school attendance for not more than ten days include notification of the length of the suspension, information regarding the availability of community-based educational programs, alternative education programs or other educational options, and of the student’s right to return to regular school attendance upon the expiration of the suspension. The costs of any community-based educational program, or alternative education program or educational option, which is not a part of the educational program offered by the school division, shall be borne by the parent of the student.
     </p>
     <p>
      School boards shall adopt policies and procedures to ensure that suspended students are able to access and complete graded work during and after the suspension.

The costs of any community-based educational, training, or intervention program that is not a part of the educational program offered by the school division that the student may attend during his expulsion shall be borne by the parent of the student.Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the school board from permitting or requiring students expelled pursuant to this section to attend an alternative education program provided by the school board for the term of such expulsion.If the school board determines that the student is ineligible to return to regular school attendance or to attend during the expulsion an alternative education program or an adult education program in the school division, the written notice shall also advise the parent of such student that the student may petition the school board for readmission to be effective one calendar year from the date of his expulsion, and of the conditions, if any, under which readmission may be granted.School boards shall establish, by regulation, a schedule pursuant to which such students may apply and reapply for readmission to school. Such schedule shall be designed to ensure that any initial petition for readmission will be reviewed by the school board or a committee thereof, or the division superintendent, and, if granted, would enable the student to resume school attendance one calendar year from the date of the expulsion. If the division superintendent or a committee of the school board denies such petition, the student may petition the school board for review of such denial.

        Deference to teachers. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section reflects an express legislative intent to defer to teachers who are often required to make difficult and expeditious decisions. Brown v. Ramsey, 121 F. Supp. 2d 911, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16986 (E.D. Va. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the teacher argued that he did not injure student intentionally because the grabbing of the student by the teacher was accidental and done to maintain control, deference could not be accorded to the teacher’s version of events because substantial evidence in the form of bruises the student had on his body made it evident that the teacher’s touching of the student was not incidental, minor, or reasonable, and was not within the permissible exceptions for corporal punishment.

       School board did not act arbitrarily in school disciplinary proceedings, in violation of a student’s due process rights, because the assistant principal’s oral description of the facts known to school personnel, coupled with the principal’s letter and the discipline packet, notified the student of the allegations against the student. Furthermore, as the student’s own testimony confirmed, the student knew of the school’s prohibition against improper touching of another person before the student engaged in the student’s conduct.

        “Eligible school division”
      means a (i) local school division or (ii) regional vocational center, special education center, alternative education center, or academic year Governor’s School serving public school students in grades K through 12. “Eligible school division” includes the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind.

       The Authority shall issue bonds for the purpose of grant payments to eligible school divisions of the Commonwealth to be used exclusively for purchasing security equipment for schools, including any related installation, that is designed to improve and help ensure the safety of students attending public schools in the Commonwealth. Such grants shall not be used to pay for security equipment that is not included or described in a grant application approved by the Department pursuant to subsection D. The amount of grants provided to each eligible school division pursuant to this section shall not exceed $100,000 for each fiscal year of the Commonwealth. Funds for the payment of such grants shall be provided from the issuance of bonds by the Authority, provided that the Authority shall not issue more than an aggregate of $6 million in bonds, after all costs, for such grants during each fiscal year of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Authority shall ensure that no more than an aggregate principal amount of $30 million in bonds issued under this section shall be outstanding at any time. Eligible school divisions seeking a grant shall apply to the Department, which shall be responsible for administering the grant program.
       <p>
        The Authority shall work with the Department to determine the schedule for the issuance of the bonds, which shall be based in part upon eligible school divisions having sufficient funds to purchase such security equipment. The payment of debt service on such bonds shall be as provided in the general appropriation act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such grants shall be in addition to all other grants made to local governments, school boards, or school divisions according to law. In addition, such grants shall not replace or be in lieu of loans to local school boards or interest rate subsidy payments to local school boards pursuant to Chapter 11.1 (§ 22.1-175.1 et seq.), and the issuance of such bonds and the payment of such grants shall not, except as herein provided, affect or otherwise amend the provisions of such chapter as they relate to the powers and duties of the Authority, local school boards, local governments, or any other entity.

       Based on the criteria developed by the Department in collaboration with the Department of Criminal Justice Services, eligible school divisions shall apply for a grant by August 1 of each year. As a condition of receiving a grant, a local match of 25 percent of the grant amount shall be required. The Superintendent is authorized to reduce the local match for local school divisions with a composite index of local ability-to-pay less than 0.2000, including any such school division participating in a regional vocational center, special education center, alternative education center, or academic year Governor’s School. The Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind shall be exempt from the match requirement.
       <p>
        Grants shall be awarded by the Department on a competitive basis. As part of the application for a grant, each eligible school division shall (i) identify with specificity the security equipment for which grants are being sought, as well as the estimated costs to purchase and install the security equipment, and (ii) certify that it is the intent of the eligible school division to purchase the security equipment within six months of approval of any grant by the Department.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the Department determines that a grant shall be paid to an eligible school division under this section, it shall provide a written certification to the chairman of the Authority directing him to make a grant payment in a specific amount to the eligible school division. The Department, however, shall not make such written certification until it has established that the Authority has sufficient funds to make such grant payment. The Authority shall only make grant payments to an eligible school division for the grants provided under this section upon receipt of such written certification. The Authority shall make such grant payments, and in the amounts as directed by the Department, within 30 days of receipt of the certification.

      Acts 2010, cc. 386 and 629, cl. 3 provides: “That the annual cost incurred by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia in preparing the projected annual estimates required by this act, not to exceed $115,000, shall be deducted from the amount appropriated for state sales and use tax distribution to localities based on school age population, with the net amount of funding after such payments to be distributed to localities. Funding not to exceed $115,000 each year shall be transferred from the amount appropriated in Direct Aid to Public Education for state sales and use tax distribution to localities based on school age population to the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. The Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia shall provide the Department of Education with the yearly population estimate by June 30 of each year.”

      When plaintiff alleged lead poisoning, the court permitted defendants to subpoena the school records of his mother under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:9 so that an expert could use them in determining whether plaintiff’s deficits were due to lead or other factors, such as the mother’s education and intelligence. The records were not privileged under subsection A of § 22.1-287, and they were relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:1; however, non-medical records in the school records were to be kept under seal because of their sensitive nature and medical records in the school records excluded from production because they did not contain information about the mother’s intelligence or educational level.

     </p>
     <p>
      “Child day program”

The provider of a licensed or registered family day home shall disclose to the parents or guardians of children in their care the percentage of time per week that persons other than the provider will care for the children. Family day homes serving five through 12 children, exclusive of the provider’s own children and any children who reside in the home, shall be licensed. However, no family day home shall care for more than four children under the age of two, including the provider’s own children and any children who reside in the home, unless the family day home is licensed or voluntarily registered.

     </p>
     <p>
      “Publicly funded provider”
    means any (i) educational program provided by a school division or local government to children between birth and age five or (ii) child day program that receives state or federal funds in support of its operations that serves three or more unrelated children. “Publicly funded provider” does not include any program for which the sole source of public funding is the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service.
     </p>
     <p>

      Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 251 and 510, cl. 4 provides: “That the Department of Education (the Department) shall establish a two-year pilot program for the purpose of stabilizing and improving the quality of services provided in the Commonwealth’s child care industry. To the extent permitted under federal law and regulations, the pilot program shall provide a fixed sum of funds to certain child care providers that have entered into a contract with the Department or its agents or designees to provide child care services funded by the Child Care and Development Block Grant and that have agreed to meet higher standards of quality and care, as determined by the Department. The fixed amount of funds disbursed to a participating child care provider shall be determined based on (i) the number of children that the provider contracts with the Department to provide care for, subject to any attendance requirements established by the Department; (ii) the Department’s estimated comprehensive costs of providing high-quality, full-time child care services; and (iii) funds necessary to provide equitable compensation to child care staff. In determining which child care providers shall be permitted to participate in the pilot program, the Department shall prioritize providers that are located in areas of the Commonwealth that have the greatest need for child care services and serve families that are underserved and have the greatest need for child care services. The Department shall require all child care providers that participate in the pilot program to report to the Department (a) de-identified data regarding wages paid to employees of the provider and associated retention rates, (b) information that can be used to assess the financial stability of providers both before and during participation in the pilot program, and (c) any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program. The Department shall report to the Governor and the General Assembly no later than December 1 of each year of the pilot program. Such report shall include (1) the number of child care providers selected to participate in the pilot program; (2) the criteria for selection and other statistical information about child care providers selected to participate in the pilot program; (3) the locations of participating child care providers; (4) information regarding wages paid to employees of participating child care providers and associated retention rates; (5) information that can be used to assess the financial stability of participating child care providers both before and during participation in the pilot program; (6) child outcome analysis and evaluation; (7) actual expenditures for the pilot program; (8) the projected cost of and potential revenue sources for expanding the pilot program to all child care providers that have entered into a contract with the Department or its agents or designees to provide child care services funded by the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (9) any other information deemed necessary by the Department to evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot program.”

The Department shall also analyze the effectiveness of using a cost-of-quality modeling system for the child care subsidy program. The Department shall report its findings to the Governor and the General Assembly no later than December 1, 2021.”

Such notice shall be served on the child day program or family day system or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the child day program or family day system.The summary suspension hearing shall be presided over by a hearing officer selected by the Superintendent from a list prepared by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia and shall be held as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days following service of the notice of summary suspension; however, the hearing officer may grant a written request for a continuance, not to exceed an additional 10 business days, for good cause shown. Within 10 business days after such hearing, the hearing officer shall provide to the Superintendent written findings and conclusions, together with a recommendation as to whether the license should be summarily suspended.Within 10 business days of the receipt of the hearing officer’s findings, conclusions, and recommendation, the Superintendent may issue a final order of summary suspension or an order that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented.

       Inspection of unlicensed child care operations; inspection warrant.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to perform his duties under this chapter, the Superintendent may enter and inspect any unlicensed child care operation with the consent of the owner or person in charge, or pursuant to a warrant. Administrative search warrants for inspections of child care operations, based upon a petition demonstrating probable cause and supported by an affidavit, may be issued ex parte by any judge having authority to issue criminal warrants whose territorial jurisdiction includes the child care operation to be inspected, if he is satisfied from the petition and affidavit that there is reasonable and probable cause for the inspection. The affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused, or that facts and circumstances exist reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Such facts may include, without limitation, past refusals to permit inspection or facts establishing reason to believe that seeking consent would provide an opportunity to conceal violations of statutes or regulations. Probable cause may be demonstrated by an affidavit showing probable cause to believe that the child care operation is in violation of any provision of this chapter or any regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter, or upon a showing that the inspection is to be made pursuant to a reasonable administrative plan for the administration of this chapter. The inspection of a child care operation that has been the subject of a complaint pursuant to § 22.1-289.042 shall have preeminent priority over any other inspections of child care operations to be made by the Superintendent unless the complaint on its face or in the context of information known to the Superintendent discloses that the complaint has been brought to harass, to retaliate, or otherwise to achieve an improper purpose, and that the improper purpose casts serious doubt on the veracity of the complaint. After issuing a warrant under this section, the judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by §

      With such funds as are appropriated for this purpose, the Superintendent shall establish a toll-free telephone line to respond to complaints regarding operations of child day programs or family day systems. Upon receipt of a complaint concerning the operation of a child day program or family day system, regardless of whether the program is subject to licensure, the Superintendent shall, for good cause shown, cause an investigation to be made, including on-site visits as he deems necessary, of the activities, services, records, and facilities. The child day program or family day system shall afford the Superintendent reasonable opportunity to inspect all of the operator’s activities, services, records, and facilities and to interview its agents and employees and any child within its control. Whenever a child day program or family day system subject to inspection under this section is determined by the Superintendent to be in noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter or with regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, the Superintendent shall give reasonable notice to the child day program or family day system of the nature of its noncompliance and may thereafter take appropriate action as provided by law, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the child day program or family day system.

       Discrimination. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amending their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Adam P. Ebbin, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-080, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 9 (3/4/15).

        Duties of high school principal and division superintendent compared. —

      <p>
       When the duties of the division superintendent and the high school principal are compared, it is apparent that the principal is, for his school, essentially a counterpart of the superintendent. Although the fundamental authority of a high school principal is diminished and restricted, the function is very similar. Banks v. Sellers,

       does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board member and to do so without any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendent’s recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E of § 2.2-3119 are satisfied when a school board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative.

The division superintendent shall implement such performance evaluation process in making employment recommendations to the school board pursuant to § 22.1-293. Principals and assistant principals who have achieved continuing contract status shall be formally evaluated at least once every three years and evaluated informally at least once each year that they are not formally evaluated. Probationary principals and assistant principals shall be evaluated each school year.

Before recommending such reassignment, the division superintendent shall consider, among other things, the performance evaluations for such principal, assistant principal, or supervisor. The principal, assistant principal, or supervisor shall elect whether such meeting shall be with the division superintendent, the division superintendent’s designee, or the school board. The school board, division superintendent, or the division superintendent’s designee shall determine what processes are to be followed at the meeting.

      <p>
       In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which three public school administrators had obtained continuing contract status by virtue of Virginia law, they unsuccessfully asserted that a county school board, members of the board, and a superintendent violated the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving them of their constitutionally protected right to a continuing contract. Since the contract dispute began, they had worked in their positions and they had been paid; they had not suffered a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest because their right was to continued employment itself, not a particular job or job title.

       Where a school employee was demoted and the employee’s employment contract was not renewed after the employee sought to marry a subordinate, the employee’s procedural due process claim failed because, even assuming that the employee had a protected property interest in continued employment, the first amended complaint was devoid of any allegations of procedural deficiencies related to the employee’s termination.

       does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board member and to do so without any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendent’s recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E of § 2.2-3119 are satisfied when a school board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 of the Code of Virginia and consistent with the discretion granted to a school board pursuant to § 22.1-307 of the Code of Virginia to retain an employee who is convicted of an offense subsequent to the employee’s hiring, a school board may employ an individual who, at the time of the individual’s hiring, has been convicted of a felony, provided that such individual (i) was employed in good standing by a school board on or before December 17, 2015; (ii) has been granted a simple pardon for such offense by the Governor or other appropriate authority; and (iii) has had his civil rights restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority. However, a school board may employ, until July 1, 2020, such an individual who does not satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii), provided that such individual has been continuously employed by the school board from December 17, 2015, through July 1, 2018.”

       Although § 22.1-299 prohibits a school board from regularly employing a teacher not licensed by the Board of Education, except as a substitute, that section does not guarantee that every person licensed by the Board of Education is eligible to be hired as a teacher because, by its clear terms subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 applies not only to regular teachers, but all school board employees, whether full-time or part-time, permanent, or temporary; thus, § 22.1-299 does not constrain subsection A of § 22.1-296.1.Butler v.

       Although subsection A of § 22.1-296.4 requires each applicant for employment to consent to a search, by the school board to which he or she applies, of the registry of founded child abuse and neglect complaints, and subsection B of § 22.1-296.4 prohibits school boards from hiring any applicant for whom such a search indicates that he or she has been the subject of a founded complaint, there is no inconsistency between those provisions and subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 even though subsection B of § 22.1-296.4 includes the phrase “such applicant shall be denied employment,” as the absence of those or similar words from subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 does not diminish the clarity of the latter section’s language.

       Because plaintiff was convicted of a felony in 1992, she could not fulfill the statutory condition precedent to employment in 2006, and the school board lacked authority to hire her then; thus, it lacked the authority to make a continuing contract with her in 2007, and the continuing contract was ultra vires and void ab initio.

      <p>
       Because subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 clearly expresses the legislature’s direction that those who have already been convicted of a felony when they apply for employment by a school board may not be hired, it is the legislature’s prerogative to allow a school board to consider the service record of an employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony after the employee was hired and to then decide whether termination is appropriate.

       In a case where plaintiff was convicted of a felony drug offense in 1992, applied to a school board for a teaching position in 2006, truthfully disclosed her prior conviction on her application, and was hired as a special education teacher, the circuit court did not err in declaring that the school board lacked the authority to hire plaintiff because this statute required, as a condition precedent to employment, that every applicant for employment by a school board had to certify that he or she had not been convicted of any felony, and plaintiff could not fulfill that statutory condition precedent based on her 1992 felony conviction and, thus, she was not eligible to be hired by the board.

      <li id="t22.1c15a02s22.1-303ol1A">
       A probationary term of service of three years in the same school division shall be required before a teacher is issued a continuing contract. School boards shall provide each probationary teacher except probationary teachers who have prior successful teaching experience, as determined by the local school board in a school division, a mentor teacher, as described by Board guidelines developed pursuant to § 22.1-305.1, during the first year of the probationary period, to assist such probationary teacher in achieving excellence in instruction. During the probationary period, such probationary teacher shall be evaluated annually based upon the evaluation procedures developed by the employing school board for use by the division superintendent and principals in evaluating teachers as required by subsection C of § 22.1-295. A teacher in his first year of the probationary period shall be evaluated informally at least once during the first semester of the school year. The division superintendent shall consider such evaluations, among other things, in making any recommendations to the school board regarding the nonrenewal of such probationary teacher’s contract as provided in § 22.1-305.
       <p>
        Any teacher hired on or after July 1, 2001, shall be required, as a condition of achieving continuing contract status, to have successfully completed training in instructional strategies and techniques for intervention for or remediation of students who fail or are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments. Local school divisions shall be required to provide said training at no cost to teachers employed in their division. In the event a local school division fails to offer said training in a timely manner, no teacher will be denied continuing contract status for failure to obtain such training.
       </p>

      <li id="t22.1c15a02s22.1-303ol1B">
       Once a continuing contract status has been attained in a school division in the Commonwealth, another probationary period need not be served in any other school division unless such probationary period, not to exceed two years, is made a part of the contract of employment. Further, when a teacher has attained continuing contract status in a school division in the Commonwealth and separates from and returns to teaching service in a school division in Virginia by the beginning of the third year, such teacher shall be required to serve a probationary period not to exceed two years, if made a part of the contract for employment.
      </li>
      <li id="t22.1c15a02s22.1-303ol1C">
       For the purpose of calculating the years of service required to attain continuing contract status, at least 160 contractual teaching days during the school year shall be deemed the equivalent of one year in the first year of service by a teacher.

       Before a division superintendent recommends to the school board nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status, the division superintendent shall consider, among other things, the performance evaluations for such teacher required by § 22.1-303 and shall notify the teacher of the proposed recommendation. Upon written request of the teacher within five working days after receipt of such notice, the division superintendent or his designee shall orally provide the specific reasons, if any, for such recommendation, along with supporting documentation, including such performance evaluations, to the teacher and, if requested by the teacher, to his or her representative. Within 10 days after receiving such reasons, the teacher may request, by notification in writing to the division superintendent, a conference before the division superintendent. Upon such request, the division superintendent shall set a date for the conference, which shall be within 30 days of the request, and shall give the teacher at least 15 days’ notice of the time and place of the conference.

       In any case in which a teacher requests reasons for the recommendation as provided in this section, written notice of nonrenewal of the contract by the school board must be given either within 10 days after the time for requesting a conference has expired and the teacher has not made a timely request for a conference or, if a conference is requested, within 30 days after the division superintendent notifies the teacher of his intention with respect to the recommendation and the provisions of § 22.1-304 requiring such notice on or before June 15 shall not be applicable.

       Definitions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Business day”
    means any day that the relevant school board office is open.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Day”
    means calendar days unless a different meaning is clearly expressed in this article. Whenever the last day for performing an act required by this article falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the act may be performed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Dismissal”
    means the dismissal of any teacher during the term of such teacher’s contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Grievance”
    means a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to his employment, including (i) disciplinary action including dismissal; (ii) the application or interpretation of (a) personnel policies, (b) procedures, (c) rules and regulations, (d) ordinances, and (e) statutes; (iii) acts of reprisal against a teacher for filing or processing a grievance, participating as a witness in any step, meeting, or hearing relating to a grievance, or serving as a member of a fact-finding panel; and (iv) complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, political affiliation, disability, age, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or military status. Each school board shall have the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of the school division. Accordingly, the term “grievance” shall not include a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to (a) establishment and revision of wages or salaries, position classifications, or general benefits; (b) suspension of a teacher or nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status; (c) the establishment or contents of ordinances, statutes, or personnel policies, procedures, rules, and regulations; (d) failure to promote; (e) discharge, layoff, or suspension from duties because of decrease in enrollment, decrease in enrollment or abolition of a particular subject, or insufficient funding; (f) hiring, transfer, assignment, and retention of teachers within the school division; (g) suspension from duties in emergencies; (h) the methods, means, and personnel by which the school division’s operations are to be carried on; or (i) coaching or extracurricular activity sponsorship.
     </p>
     <p>
      While these management rights are reserved to the school board, failure to apply, where applicable, the rules, regulations, policies, or procedures as written or established by the school board is grievable.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Military status”
    means status as (i) a member of the uniformed forces, as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(5), of the United States or a reserve component thereof named under 10 U.S.C. § 10101, (ii) a veteran as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), or (iii) a dependent as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911(4) except that the support provided by the service member to the individual shall have been provided 180 days immediately preceding an alleged action that if proven true would constitute unlawful discrimination under this section instead of 180 days immediately preceding an application for relief under 50 U.S.C. Chapter 50.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Religion”
    includes any outward expression of religious faith, including adherence to religious dressing and grooming practices and the carrying or display of religious items or symbols.

        Discretion of school boards. —

      </p>
      <p>
       School boards, as well as other administrative agencies, should have wide discretion in deciding whether or not to continue employment of their personnel. Discretion, however, means exercise of judgment, not bias or capriciousness. Thus, such a decision must be based upon fact and supported by reasoned analysis. Gwathmey v. Atkinson, 447 F. Supp. 1113, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12844 (E.D. Va. 1976) (decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 clearly expresses the legislature’s direction that those who have already been convicted of a felony when they apply for employment by a school board may not be hired, it is the legislature’s prerogative to allow a school board to consider the service record of an employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony after the employee was hired and to then decide whether termination is appropriate.

       The interest can be grounded in either this section or § 22.1-315. The property interest in continued employment provided by this section includes a right not to have such employment interrupted by a suspension. Thus, the continuing contract statute provides an alternative source of plaintiff’s property interest in not being suspended, which interest is more explicitly established in § 22.1-315. Wilkinson v.

       A school board may rely on its counsel who both presents the superintendent’s case for dismissal of a school teacher and acts as advisor to the school board itself, which must make an independent assessment of the dismissal decision. As a matter of law, a school board’s reliance on its attorney who also presents the case for the superintendent does not violate a teacher’s right to constitutional due process. Breitling v.

       School principal was covered by both of two articles in subdivision 6 of § 22.1-79, and thus, an exception applied, which meant he was not entitled to use the grievance procedure in that stature; rather, he had to look to the grievance procedure rights available under § 22.1-308, and since that provision only applied to the suspension of teachers, his suspension from his position as a school principal did not involve a grievable matter.

     <p>
      In the event a division superintendent determines to recommend dismissal of any teacher, written notice shall be sent to the teacher notifying him of the proposed dismissal and informing him that within 10 business days after receiving the notice the teacher may request a hearing before the school board or, at the option of the local school board, a hearing officer appointed by the school board as provided in § 22.1-311. During such 10-business-day period and thereafter until a hearing is held in accordance with the provisions of this section, if one is requested by the teacher, the merits of the recommendation of the division superintendent shall not be considered, discussed or acted upon by the school board except as provided for in this section. At the request of the teacher, the division superintendent shall provide the reasons for the recommendation in writing or, if the teacher prefers, in a personal interview. In the event a teacher requests a hearing pursuant to § 22.1-311, the division superintendent shall provide, within 10 days of the request, the teacher or his representative with the opportunity to inspect and copy his personnel file and all other documents relied upon in reaching the decision to recommend dismissal. Within 10 days of the request of the division superintendent, the teacher or his representative shall provide the division superintendent with the opportunity to inspect and copy the documents to be offered in rebuttal to the decision to recommend dismissal. The division superintendent and the teacher or his representative shall be under a continuing duty to disclose and produce any additional documents identified later which may be used in the respective parties’ cases-in-chief. The cost of copying such documents shall be paid by the requesting party.

      For the purposes of this section, “personnel file” means any and all memoranda, entries, or other documents included in the teacher’s file as maintained in the central school administration office or in any file on the teacher maintained within a school in which the teacher serves.

       Defendant’s argument that plaintiff’s child abuse relieved it of any obligation to abide by contractual terms, based on state common law, could not prevail, given that the Virginia Code expressly contemplates that continuing contract teachers who are accused of bad behavior must be granted a hearing upon demand.

      <p>
       Where school board provided plaintiff a hearing to which she was entitled the first time the superintendent recommended her dismissal (before the findings of abuse made by the Department of Social Services (DSS) were affirmed), and then provided plaintiff with yet another hearing, after the DSS affirmed the findings of abuse below, the spirit of this section was complied with. An additional hearing under this section would not have changed the outcome — termination — in this case. Hence, plaintiff suffered no injury because she was “deprived” of an additional opportunity to appear before the school board. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F. Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15157 (W.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 149 F.3d 1172, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 22944 (4th Cir. 1998).

      <p>
       Before the school board suspended plaintiff without pay, it conducted a hearing on the matter (after already having conducted an extraordinarily long hearing previously). Therefore, the school board’s failure to grant plaintiff a hearing when it concluded that plaintiff would be dismissed, although technically contrary to the Virginia Code, had no effect on plaintiff’s suspension without pay, since a hearing preceded this decision.

      <p>
       Where school board provided plaintiff a hearing to which she was entitled the first time the superintendent recommended her dismissal (before the findings of abuse made by the Department of Social Services (DSS) were affirmed), and then provided plaintiff with yet another hearing, after the DSS affirmed the findings of abuse below, the spirit of § 22.1-309 was complied with. An additional hearing under § 22.1-309 would not have changed the outcome — termination — in this case. Hence, plaintiff suffered no injury because she was “deprived” of an additional opportunity to appear before the school board. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F. Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15157 (W.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 149 F.3d 1172, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 22944 (4th Cir. 1998).

       Where defendant argued that plaintiff’s child abuse relieved it of any obligation to abide by contractual terms, this argument (based on state common law) could not prevail, given that the Virginia Code expressly contemplates that continuing contract teachers who are accused of bad behavior must be granted a hearing upon demand.

      </p>
      <p>
       The members of a school board and a fact-finding panel enjoy limited good-faith immunity. In performing discretionary functions, these defendants are generally shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. For the plaintiff to recover damages, therefore, there must be both a finding of a constitutional violation and a finding that the official’s decision was objectively unreasonable. Lee v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd., 648 F. Supp. 744, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18423 (W.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 829 F.2d 1120, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12212 (4th Cir. 1987) (decided under former § 22.1-312).

       Panel fact-findings were not entitled to the same weight given jury verdicts and were thus not binding on a local school board since the fact-finding panel provided for in § 22.1-310 and this section bears no proper relationship to juries and a school board’s power to discharge employees is rooted in the Va. Const., Art. VIII, § 7 and § 22.1-313 plainly contemplates that a local school board can and will, on occasion, disagree with the recommendations of a fact-finding panel.

       Section 22.1-295 appears to contemplate for the superintendent a role in the screening of all applicants to ensure that everyone considered by the school board possesses suitable qualifications and moral character. The superintendent has no power to hire or fire. As this section makes clear, the school board shall retain its exclusive final authority over matters concerning employment and supervision of its personnel, including dismissals, suspensions and placing on probation.

       does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board member and to do so without any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendent’s recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E of § 2.2-3119 are satisfied when a school board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative.

      Decisions regarding whether or not a matter is grievable shall be made by the school board at the request of the school division administration or grievant and such decision shall be made within 10 business days of such request. The school board shall reach its decision only after allowing the school division administration and the grievant opportunity to present written or oral arguments regarding grievability. The decision as to whether the arguments shall be written or oral shall be in the discretion of the school board. Decisions of the school board may be appealed to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division for a hearing on the issue of grievability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proceedings for review of the decision of the school board shall be instituted by filing a notice of appeal with the school board within 10 business days after the date of the decision and giving a copy thereof to all other parties. Within 10 business days thereafter, the school board shall transmit to the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken a copy of its decision, a copy of the notice of appeal, and the exhibits. The failure of the school board to transmit the record within the time allowed shall not prejudice the rights of the grievant. The court, on motion of the grievant, may issue a writ of certiorari requiring the school board to transmit the record on or before a certain date. Within 10 business days of receipt by the clerk of such record, the court, sitting without a jury, shall hear the appeal on the record transmitted by the school board and such additional evidence as may be necessary to resolve any controversy as to the correctness of the record. The court, in its discretion, may receive such other evidence as the ends of justice require. The court may affirm the decision of the school board or may reverse or modify the decision. The decision of the court shall be rendered no later than the fifteenth day from the date of the conclusion of the hearing. Such determination of grievability shall be made subsequent to the reduction of the grievance to writing but prior to any hearing or the right to such determination shall be deemed to have been waived.

       Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to review the school board’s determination concerning the school principal’s suspension from his position as a high school principal, and since a suspension was not a grievable matter, the trial court should have entered judgment for the school board on the grievability issue.

       A school board erred in finding that the termination of a coach’s one-year coaching contract was not grievable; § 22.1-314 stated in relevant part that decisions regarding whether or not a matter was grievable had to be made by the school board and such decision had to be made within 10 days of such request. The school board’s decision in the instant action was not made within this 10-day period, and the coach did not waive the 10-day decision requirement, so the decision by the school board that the complaint was not grievable was not timely, and the coach had to be allowed to proceed with the grievance process.

       Before the school board suspended plaintiff without pay, it conducted a hearing on the matter (after already having conducted an extraordinarily long hearing previously). Therefore, the school board’s failure to grant plaintiff a hearing when it concluded that plaintiff would be dismissed, although technically contrary to the Virginia Code, had no effect on plaintiff’s suspension without pay, since a hearing preceded this decision.

        Teacher employed under continuing contract has a property interest in not having employment suspended.

       The interest can be grounded in either § 22.1-307 or this section. The property interest in continued employment provided by § 22.1-307 includes a right not to have such employment interrupted by a suspension. Thus, the continuing contract statute provides an alternative source of plaintiff’s property interest in not being suspended, which interest is more explicitly established in this section.

        The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel without reference to their states of origin can increase the available educational resources.

       The purposes of the college partnership laboratory school application are to present the proposed school’s academic and operational vision and plans, demonstrate the applicant’s capacities to execute the proposed vision and plans, and provide the Board with a clear basis for assessing the applicant’s plans and capacities. An approved college partnership laboratory school application shall not serve as the school’s contract. Within 90 days of approval of a college partnership laboratory school application, the Board and the governing board of the approved school shall execute a contract that clearly sets forth the academic and operational performance expectations and measures by which the college partnership laboratory school will be judged and the administrative relationship between the Board and the college partnership laboratory school, including each party’s rights and duties. The performance expectations and measures set forth in the contract shall include applicable federal and state accountability requirements.
