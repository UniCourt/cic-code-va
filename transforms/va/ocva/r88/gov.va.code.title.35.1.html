       Transition provisions.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In response to a resolution of the State Board of Health to the Virginia Code Commission, the 1979 General Assembly enacted House Joint Resolution 198, requesting the Code Commission to study and recodify Title 35 of the Code. In January of 1981, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed provision of Title 35, Hotels, Restaurants and Camps, of the Code. This report, which was published as House Document No. 11 of the 1981 session, contains reviser’s notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission’s draft of the revision of Title 35, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 468 of the Acts of 1981. Effective October 1, 1981, it repeals Title 35 of the Code and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 35.1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 1981, c. 468, cls. 5 and 6 provide:
     </p>
     <p>
      “5. That wherever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions, or contents of any section, article, or chapter of Title 35, or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to October one, nineteen hundred eighty-one, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article, or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article, or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article, or chapter of Title 35 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article, or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, or contents or portion thereof.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “6. That the regulations of the State Board of Health in effect on the effective date of this act [Oct. 1, 1981] shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act.”

     <p>
      Infrequent use of a “farm building or structure” to host concerts, dances or other social gatherings does not constitute a change in occupancy classification and, therefore, does not require the owner to obtain an occupancy permit for the new uses. See opinion of Attorney General to Kevin J. Burke, Esquire, Fauquier County Attorney, 10-071, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 49 (8/23/10).

       Food prepared in home or church for charitable purposes. —

     <p>
      A private kitchen in a home or church is not subject to food preparation and service requirements of the State Health Commissioner when the kitchen is used to prepare food to donate to a charitable organization, where the charitable organization is engaged in a food distribution program for the needy. However, the Board of Health may issue advisory guidelines, which reasonably should be considered by those preparing the food. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Mark D. Sickles, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 15-063, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 11 (7/22/16).

      A private kitchen in a home or church is not subject to food preparation and service requirements of the State Health Commissioner when the kitchen is used to prepare food to donate to a charitable organization, where the charitable organization is engaged in a food distribution program for the needy. However, the Board of Health may issue advisory guidelines, which reasonably should be considered by those preparing the food. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Mark D. Sickles, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 15-063, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 11 (7/22/16).
