        Purpose. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, even after the 1978 and 1979 amendments, continues to meet its original purported purpose to conserve the family home (shelter) from forced sales. In re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Intent of 1978 and 1979 amendments. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Virginia legislature in its amendments of this section in 1978 and 1979 intended that single persons maintaining a separate residence, and persons separated or divorced from their spouses and maintaining a separate residence, should be entitled to an exemption and this entitlement would be without regard to whether, upon establishing a separate residence, such persons also assumed the mantle of “head of the household”; however, the legislature did not intend to grant double exemptions where there was only one residence occupied by two people. In re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980); In re Doan, 11 Bankr. 704, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981).

       <b>
        How federal court must interpret Virginia exemptions. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Congress has the power under the Constitution to establish uniform bankruptcy laws, and has enacted a specific provision for exemptions, 11 U.S.C. § 522, a federal court must adopt an interpretation of Virginia’s law with respect to exemptions that does not conflict with the Bankruptcy Act’s exemption provision. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Exemption involving intentional tort allowed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Congress specifically legislated as to the type of claims that can be enforced against exempt property, and since the plaintiff’s claim did not fall within any of the enumerated exceptions, the court concluded that the debtor was entitled to her exemptions notwithstanding that the plaintiff held a nondischargeable claim based on an intentional tort. In re Scott, 199 Bankr. 586, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1041 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996).

      <p>
       <b>
        Relation to wage exemption. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to debtor’s deferred compensation plan (partner equity plan), debtor’s claim of exemption of 75 percent of distribution from plan was proper because distribution that debtor was entitled to receive from partner equity plan qualified as “earnings” under definition contained in statute and “exemption” meant protection from all forms of creditor process whether or not there was pending garnishment at time of bankruptcy filing. In re Foster, 556 Bankr. 233, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2963 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016).

        The homestead exemption by its express terms is made available to any resident of Virginia,

       without regard to whether such person is a wage earner. In re Fromal, 151 Bankr. 730, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20852 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 14 F.3d 594, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5029 (4th Cir. 1994).

       with respect to the proceeds of a personal injury settlement did not apply to the equitable lien a subrogated ERISA plan had against the proceeds of a beneficiary’s settlement, since that lien gave the plan a security interest in the proceeds of the settlement. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Carpenter (In re Carpenter), 252 Bankr. 905, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13797 (E.D. Va. 2000), aff'd, 36 Fed. Appx. 80, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 10615 (4th Cir. 2002).

       Debtor had a motive for concealment when valuing his claim or failing to amend the schedules after he filed a personal injury action against a corporation because his unsecured debt was $534,000, his secured debt was $762,000, the exemption statute, §

       , did not apply where the lienholder was secured, and, thus, his secured creditors would have been able to collect on any award or settlement recovered by him; therefore, he was judicially estopped from seeking more than $1 million in damages against the corporation when he listed the personal injury claim as $1 million on his schedules. Payne v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 606 F. Supp. 2d 613, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106938 (E.D. Va. 2008).

        “Householder” and “head of family” are convertible terms. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms “householder” and “head of the family” are convertible terms, and are employed as explanatory the one of the other. They involve the idea of dependence and support, coupled with a legal or moral obligation to support the dependent. Oppenheim v. Myers,
       <cite class="va_code">
        99 Va. 582
       </cite>
       , 39

       </cite>
       , 1901 Va. LEXIS 82 (1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section defines “householder” and not “head of family,” these terms have been considered equivalent. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The language “shall include” should not be considered a limitation
       </b>
       but should be considered an extension or enlargement of the definition “householder.” Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The phrase “whether or not others are living with him”
       </b>
       found in this section (which was added by the 1978 amendment to this section) is clearly intended only to drop the long-standing requirement that in order for a person to be a “householder” he must have dependents. In re Doan, 11 Bankr. 704, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981).

        A husband and wife, living together, may both be deemed householders

      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the ambiguities in the householder definition and of strong policy considerations, this section can and should be read to allow a homestead exemption to each spouse living together if he or she contributes to the maintenance of the household. Roberts v. County of Henrico Fed. Credit Union, 709 F.2d 275, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 26893 (4th Cir. 1983).

        Allowing only one householder per residence would conflict with bankruptcy laws. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A construction of Virginia law that allows only one householder per residence, would be inconsistent with § 522(m) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., which must be interpreted as allowing each debtor in a joint case to take some exemptions, whether the amount is determined by state or federal law. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife who filed a joint voluntary petition in bankruptcy with her husband was a householder within the meaning of this section, and was therefore entitled to a homestead exemption in addition to her husband’s, where they were married to each other and living together at the time of filing. Cheeseman v. Nachman, 656 F.2d 60, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 10915 (4th Cir. 1981).

        Where debtors were married and living together, and only the husband was employed,
       </b>
       and where they were not each maintaining a separate residence or living quarters, under the applicable Virginia law the wife did not meet the definition of a “householder” and was not entitled to the homestead exemption in the bankruptcy proceeding. In re Thompson, 4 Bankr. 823, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11972 (E.D. Va. 1980).

       Although this section provides that any person may be a householder “whether or not others are living with him,” this clause does not extend to a child who lives with his parents and is not supporting dependent parents.

      </p>
      <p>
       A son living with his parents did not qualify as a householder, since the primary purpose of the homestead exemption is to conserve the family home, and where debtor had neither an ownership interest nor a lease interest in his parents’ residence, which was the home to be “conserved,” the underlying purpose of the exemption statute did not support defendant’s exemption claim.

       This section is constitutional. In re White, 11 Bankr. 775, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3777 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981).

        This section does not offend 11 U.S.C.S. § 522.

       It was specifically allowed by 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(1). In re White, 11 Bankr. 775, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3777 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the wording of this section, it is clear that this title is the applicable law with regard to exemptions permitted under Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.S. § 522). Simmons v. Peoples Bank, 27 Bankr. 508, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6785 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1983).

        Limitation on “opting out”. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority for this “opting out” statute, 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(1), does not give the states the power to “opt out” of § 522 in its entirety, but allows “opting out” only with respect to the federal exemptions. Bass v. Thacker, 5 Bankr. 592, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4671 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This “opting out” statute is clearly limited by its language to excluding only the federal exemptions specified in § 522(d). Bass v. Thacker, 5 Bankr. 592, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4671 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), the specific provision relating to the federal exemption scheme, is not law in Virginia. There is no effect on the so-called “lien avoidance” §§ 522(e) and (f). F &amp; M Bank v. Boyd, 11 Bankr. 690, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3549 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981).

       Failure of a debtor to comply with the Virginia homestead exemption statute precludes him from claiming that exemption for bankruptcy purposes. Zimmerman v. Morgan, 689 F.2d 471, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 26036 (4th Cir. 1982).

        Virginia has “opted-out” of the federal exemption scheme and Virginia debtors may only assert Virginia exemptions,

       including the homestead exemption. In re Calhoun, 47 Bankr. 119, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6687 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section allows Virginia residents to use only the exemptions created under state law. In order for a Virginia debtor to avoid a lien pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f)(1) or (2), therefore, the debtor must be entitled to an exemption under state law. Shearer v. Crestar Bank, 132 Bankr. 313, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 2048 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A state may by statute “opt out” of allowing its residents to take advantage of the federal exemptions, which the state has done, and accordingly, residents of the state filing bankruptcy petitions may claim only those exemptions allowable under state law and general federal law. In re Scott, 199 Bankr. 586, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1041 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996).
      </p>

       Because the Commonwealth of Virginia has opted out of the federal exemption scheme, a debtor must claim his exemptions in compliance with Virginia law. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000).

      <p>
       Although Virginia opted out of the federal exemptions of 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), the exemptions claimed by a Virginia debtor under the Virginia homestead laws are still protected by the debtor’s ability under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(f) to avoid judgment liens and nonpossessory nonpurchase money security interests in certain household and personal goods to the extent of the exemptions allowable under Virginia law. Beneficial Fin. Co. v. Rodgers, 5 Bankr. 761, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4496 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980), disapproved, Sumy v. Schlossberg, 777 F.2d 921, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24209 (4th Cir. 1985).

        A remedial statute such as this one must be construed liberally so as to afford all the relief within the power of the court which the language of the statute indicates that the legislature intended. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        With reference to homestead exemptions, courts employ the most liberal and humane rules of interpretation to insure the unfortunate debtor and his equally unfortunate but more helpless family, the shelter and influence of the object which the exemption provides. Dickens v. Snellings, 10 Bankr. 949, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3787 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the party asserting the exemption privilege; however, courts are neither to reduce nor enlarge the exemptions or read into the law an exemption not found there. In re Williams, 3 Bankr. 244, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5455 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the almost universal rule that exemption statutes should receive a liberal construction in favor of those intended to be benefited and favorable to the object and purposes of the enactment, and where there is doubt as to whether certain property is exempt or not, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the exemption. In re Perry, 6 Bankr. 263, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4409 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts in Virginia are required to liberally construe statutes relating to homestead laws in favor of debtors in order to protect the debtors and their families. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts must liberally construe the law pertaining to homestead deeds in favor of debtors. Furthermore, any ambiguities found in state exemption laws must be resolved in favor of debtors. In re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts should construe liberally the law pertaining to homestead deeds in favor of debtors. The law is equally clear, however, that there are certain strict requirements in a bankruptcy setting which must be observed. Homeowner's Fin. Corp. v. Pennington, 47 Bankr. 322, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Virginia homestead exemption is intended to shield helpless and unfortunate debtors and their families from the onslaught of creditors, and consequently must be liberally construed so as to afford the relief which the legislature intended the debtor to enjoy. In re Hayes, 119 Bankr. 86, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2030 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering the issue of whether creditor’s post-discharge actions taken with regard to exempt property which secured the underlying debt violated federal provisions of permanent injunction, the same rule of liberally construing a federal remedial statute in favor of the debtor is recognized in Virginia as it pertains to the Virginia exemption statutes. Martin v. AVCO Fin. Servs., 157 Bankr. 268, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 1203 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The homestead exemption by its express terms is made available to any resident of Virginia,
        </b>
        without regard to whether such person is a wage earner. In re Fromal, 151 Bankr. 730, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20852 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 14 F.3d 594, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5029 (4th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Purposes of homestead exemptions are two-fold.
        </b>
        First, they protect debtors from being left destitute from creditor process by allowing debtors to retain stakeholds. Second, by requiring a homestead deed to be filed in the jurisdiction in which the debtor resides, it enables creditors to ascertain by inspection whether the debtor is underestimating the value of the property he claims exempt, thereby keeping to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The homestead is a shield to protect the helpless
        </b>
        and unfortunate debtor from the importunate and incompassionate creditor. Linkenhoker v. Detrick,

A housewife cooks, cleans, shops for groceries, chauffeurs and generally manages the household. Her economic value to the household is certain and demonstrative. A housewife’s activities as a housewife contribute to the maintenance of that household. In re Gustinis, 16 Bankr. 108, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 2396 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981).

        In bankruptcy proceedings creditors are not precluded from objecting to the allowance of a homestead exemption because they are not armed with executions against the bankrupt. In proceedings in bankruptcy the property is in effect “seized” or “levied upon” within the meaning of this section, as much in behalf of nonjudgment creditors as of any party in interest. In a voluntary case the debtor surrenders his property, and when he claims some or all of it as exempt, he is asking that such property be not “sold” under judicial “process” or “order.” In re Campbell, 124 F. 417, 1903 U.S. Dist.

        , and the court required defendant to pay a $2,000 fine to each of the debtors in all nine cases, ordered defendant to return fees she received from the debtors, pursuant to § 110(h)(3)(B), ordered defendant to pay the United States Trustee $1,200 for violating § 110(b)(1), and ordered defendant not to engage in further conduct as a bankruptcy petition preparer that violated the Bankruptcy Code. There was no merit to defendant’s argument that she did not practice law because she obtained forms she used from the Internet or from an attorney and made only minor modifications to those forms.

        It is the duty of a bankrupt who wishes to take advantage of the homestead exemption to identify and designate the goods on which, in whole or in part, he still owes the purchase money, in order that the trustee may set apart as exempt such as have been paid for. If the bankrupt is unable to do this, having so intermingled the goods for which he has not paid with others that have been paid for as to make it impossible to designate the class for which he still owes, no homestead can be set apart in any of the goods.

        Where a large portion of goods claimed as exempt has not been paid for, and is so mingled with those that have been as to put it out of the power of the vendors to distinguish between the two, the onus is on the person claiming the exemption to show which has been paid for; and he failing to do this, they will all be treated as not having been paid for, as far as the homestead deed is concerned, and therefore not exempt under the law.

But where it appears that the wife has been guilty of no actual fraud, and that she has, out of her own means, discharged a purchase-money lien on the property, the lien will be treated as in force for her protection, and she will be subrogated to the rights of the lienor.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Bankruptcy Code specifically intended to eliminate state-created priorities especially those provided to landlords. Therefore, what subdivision (5) of this section does is to give the creditor a priority or preference over almost every other creditor. It also places rent creditors in the class of creditors which may reach exempt property thereby impermissively altering the federal law found in 11 U.S.C. § 522(c). In doing so, the Virginia statute disrupts the federal distribution scheme and its underlying goal of equality among classes of creditors. Moreover, it disrupts the second major goal of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which is to provide a debtor with a fresh start after bankruptcy, by permitting this creditor to collect a dischargeable debt out of otherwise exempt property.

      <p>
       Where a homestead deed is filed in the wrong county, the exemption must be disallowed, although good faith, diligence, and reasonable effort was made to properly file and record the homestead deed. A court must apply this rule despite the fact that cases uniformly have held that statutes creating debtors’ exemptions must be liberally construed in favor of the debtor and the exemption. Despite that general principle, there is no exception where the homestead deed is filed in an erroneous location. In re Tate, 41 Bankr. 946, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5259 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984).

       <p>
        This section is a reasonable exercise of the power granted the legislature under § 192 of the former Constitution to prescribe the conditions under which exempt property may be held. Wray v. Davenport,
        <cite class="va_code">

       <p>
        <b>
         Purposes of homestead exemptions are two-fold.
        </b>
        First, they protect debtors from being left destitute from creditor process by allowing debtors to retain stakeholds. Second, by requiring a homestead deed to be filed in the jurisdiction in which the debtor resides, it enables creditors to ascertain by inspection whether the debtor is underestimating the value of the property he claims exempt, thereby keeping to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Smith, 22 Bankr. 866, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3422 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The homestead exemption is not absolute.
        </b>
        It exists only when and after the debtor has claimed it and perfected it by recordation in the clerk’s office of an instrument setting forth his claim and giving a description and valuation of the property claimed as homestead. Until the debtor has taken the steps prescribed by this section, he is not entitled to any homestead exemption. In re Robinette, 34 F. Supp. 518, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1418 (D. Va. 1932).

         This section must be complied with. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a statute prescribes a particular method to be adopted with respect to the claiming, selecting and setting apart of the homestead, its provisions must be complied with, since the entire right to homestead exemption depends on statutory authority. Wray v. Davenport,
        <cite class="va_code">

         “Setting apart” includes

       </p>
       <p>
        When the clerk receives the homestead deed in proper form with fees paid on a date well before the fifth day after the creditors’ meeting, the exemption has been claimed in a timely manner even though the deed is not admitted to record until some day after that. Mayer v. Quy Van Nguyen (In re Quy Van Nguyen), 211 F.3d 105, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (4th Cir. 2000).

         Purpose of description and valuation. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of this section that the debtor designate and describe each parcel or article set apart, and affix to each his cash valuation thereof, is a wise and reasonable one. Its purpose is to enable creditors to ascertain, by inspection of the different articles and the prices affixed thereto, whether the debtor is making a fair and honest claim of homestead, or whether he is giving an underestimate of its value, and thereby securing to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Wilson, 108 F. 197, 1901 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 241 (D. Va. 1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the “cash valuation” is to enable creditors to ascertain, by inspection of the different articles and the prices affixed thereto, whether the debtor is making a fair and honest claim of homestead, or whether he is giving an underestimate of its value, and thereby securing to himself property that should be subjected to the payment of his debts. In re Waltrip, 260 F. Supp. 448, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6866 (E.D. Va. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of requiring a reasonably certain description and valuation of property is to enable existing creditors to determine whether the claim is honestly asserted or whether the debtor is improperly seeking to insulate his property from the payment of his debts. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 859, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983).

        <b>
         Requirement that personal property be described with “reasonable certainty” cannot be defined by a universal standard.
        </b>
        Nonetheless, courts cannot be allowed to make wholly subjective determinations of reasonableness. Whether a description is reasonably certain involves a judgment that takes into consideration the purpose of exemption statutes and the characteristics of the object to be described. Certain clearly defined principles exist to assist a court in the exercise of its discretion. Shirkey v. Leake, 715 F.2d 859, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24584 (4th Cir. 1983).

        Although a homestead deed may fail sufficiently to describe and value certain property intended to be set aside as exempt, this will not affect the validity of the deed as to other property which is accurately described and valued in the mode prescribed by law. Williams v. Watkins,

        </b>
        it did not specify whether each debtor was exempting an interest in jointly owned property nor did the deed indicate whether any of the property was individually owned and being exempted by only one of the debtors, the deed thus frustrates the purpose of requiring a reasonably certain description of the personal estates.

       <p>
        A creditor obtained judgment and levied execution against his debtor. Suit was brought by other creditors against the execution creditor alleging superior liens, and the execution creditor also brought a chancery suit against the debtor, claiming a lien in his favor on certain property of the debtor. The two suits were heard together. The court decreed that certain funds should be paid to the execution creditor. The same decree directed the payment of all the costs of the suit, and disposed of the entire funds of the debtor in the hands of receivers appointed by the court. After the adjournment of the term of court at which this decree was rendered, the debtor filed a homestead deed, claiming the amount decreed to be paid to the execution creditor as part of his homestead exemption, and filed a petition in the chancery causes, praying that it be paid over to him as part of his homestead. It was held that the fund in question had been “subjected” within the true intent and meaning of this section before the execution of the homestead deed, and the debtor having failed to claim his homestead privilege before the decree, he was concluded by it, not only because the fund had been subjected thereby, but because it was a final decree settling every controversy which had arisen in the cause.

       <p>
        A debtor who has not exempted property up to the maximum value permitted by the statute may amend his homestead deed until he reaches the maximum. In bankruptcy, however, this right to amend is restricted to adjustments in the value of property already claimed in the original homestead deed; new items may not be claimed.

       <p>
        Once a householder has filed his homestead deed and his petition in bankruptcy he may later amend that deed to increase or decrease the valuation of items claimed exempt therein. However, he may not amend the deed to claim additional items exempt. In re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Virginia law would appear at first blush to be such as to foreclose any amendments to a homestead deed after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy except for adjustments in the valuation of property already claimed exempt, this is not in fact a complete picture. Whether or not one can properly claim an exemption depends, in the first instance, on whether the debtor owns or has an interest in the subject property. Where the debtor does not have ownership or some other interest in the property when filing the homestead deed prior to bankruptcy, then this section is inapplicable. In re Smith, 45 Bankr. 100, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4500 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Debtors must strictly comply with the provisions of the Virginia homestead laws in order to claim exemptions for bankruptcy purposes. As a result, although there is no doubt but that a homestead deed may be amended to correct descriptions or values of properties listed in the original homestead deed, the law is equally clear that an amendment to a homestead deed may not set apart additional items not included in the original homestead deed.

        A homestead deed does not extinguish judgment liens against exempt property, but merely prevents seizure and sale of the encumbered property in order to satisfy the debt underlying the lien. Absent a lien avoidance proceeding under § 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 522(f)), liens survive a discharge in bankruptcy and continue in force even on exempt homestead property. A subsequent purchaser of encumbered homestead property takes the property subject to creditors’ liens. Barzee v. Trammel, 63 Bankr. 878, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 5587 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986).

The lien was not avoided in the sense liens are avoided under section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 522(f)), but was rendered unenforceable by operation of Virginia law. Barzee v.

        Virginia homestead deed is designed to protect a certain amount of debtor’s property from creditors, and where debtor listed his wages as part of his homestead, he intended to insulate that asset from his creditors. Where debtor filed his homestead deed on June 10, and a summons in garnishment was returnable June 12, he is entitled to his wages, notwithstanding the intervening bankruptcy, because wages are not subjected by sale or otherwise before recordation of homestead deed.

       <p>
        Under Virginia law, if the debtor does not choose to exempt his wages prior to the return date on the writ of garnishment, he cannot do so later. However, the strong policy of the Bankruptcy Code under § 522(g) and (h) is to allow the debtor to recover such property and exempt it where the property was preferentially transferred. Therefore, to the extent that Virginia law would bar a debtor from exempting property under § 522(g) and (h) of the Bankruptcy Code, the federal law must supersede Virginia law.

        Perfection of homestead exemption in Chapter 13 proceedings. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a Chapter 13 debtor need not perfect his homestead exemption, he derives no benefit from that fact; since Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code involves a reorganization rather than a liquidation of the debtor’s estate, the Chapter 13 debtor retains possession of his assets. Conversely, requiring the Chapter 13 debtor to perfect his homestead exemption would result in an unnecessary exhaustion of the exemption in a proceeding involving no liquidation of the debtor’s estate. Grenco Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Morris, 48 Bankr. 313, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21179 (W.D. Va. 1985).

      <p>
       While the debtor may supplement the original homestead by a new one, so as to make the aggregate equal to the maximum under this section, this privilege after being once fully exercised is regarded as exhausted. The householder cannot by successive acts hold at one time, or at different times, property which in the aggregate exceeds the maximum value. Oppenheimer v. Howell,

      <p>
       A recorded homestead deed which lists property equal in value to the entire available homestead exemption cannot be amended to decrease the value of listed property in order to add other property not previously listed, at least not if the property was owned by the debtor when the original homestead deed was filed.

     <p>
      Whenever a judgment or decree is rendered on an instrument waiving the homestead or upon a demand against which the homestead cannot be claimed the court shall include in its judgment or decree words to the following effect, as the case may be: “Upon an instrument waiving the homestead,” or “upon a claim against which the homestead cannot be demanded.” This statement shall be endorsed upon the executions issued upon such judgments or decrees. In any action or suit when it is not apparent from the face of the pleadings that the demand is not subject to the homestead exemption the plaintiff shall not have the benefit of the foregoing provision of this section unless in his declaration he alleges that his demand is not subject to such homestead exemption. But no presumption of nonwaiver or that the judgment or decree was rendered upon a demand against which homestead could be claimed is to be drawn from the silence of any judgment, execution or decree on the matters provided for by this section.

The exemption statute provides for the exemption of a “wagon or cart,” and it appears that this section intends that a farmer be allowed to exempt a piece of equipment which he needs to transport his commodities. The court acknowledges that this is a liberal interpretation of the statute’s terms; however, as mentioned earlier, such is the analysis the Virginia courts have adopted. Fleet Bros. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the statute allows an exemption for two plows, it may reasonably be concluded that a farmer may need more than one type of plow to till the soil in varying conditions. The fact that a disc does not turn over the soil as a plow might is not dispositive of whether or not debtor may claim it as exempt. The court finds that the legislature intended an exemption for a farm implement that a farmer can use to get his land ready for planting, and at the present debtor would be unable to till his land in a manner satisfactory to him without the use of the disc as a plow. For that reason, the court finds that debtor may properly claim the disc as exempt under this section. Fleet Bros. v. Newsome, 60 Bankr. 169, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6353 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986).

        Wrongful death claims distinct from personal injury category. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section refers to “causes of action for personal injury or wrongful death,” inviting the inference that Virginia intended this section to exempt two distinct types of actions from creditor process, neither of which would define or limit the other. That this section was only recently amended to include wrongful death claims bolsters the conclusion that such claims are viewed as distinct from the category of “personal injury.” In re Webb, 214 Bankr. 553, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17836 (E.D. Va. 1997).

       Account exempted under this section as the proceeds of a personal injury lawsuit settlement did not lose its exemption where tax refund monies were commingled into the account post-petition and later removed as this section did not require that the proceeds of a personal injury claim be deposited into a specially designated account, and the funds were easily traceable; there was no reason to depart from the general rule that exemptions were to be determined as of the date of the bankruptcy petition, and in this case, there was no requirement that the debtor had to segregate the proceeds of a personal injury settlement post-petition to maintain an exemption properly claimed under this section.

       In a personal injury suit against a driver, plaintiff’s medical bills, which had been discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, were admissible to show the extent of her pain, suffering, and because a bankruptcy discharge was within the scope of the collateral source rule. However, after paying creditors holding valid liens and an assignment of benefits on the proceeds of any tort recovery, plaintiff had to pay the balance of any award of medical bills to the health care providers in pro rata shares.

In exempting emergency relief payments on deposit from the creditor process, a financial institution shall look back two months preceding the date of receipt of service of the creditor process. The financial institution shall perform a one-time account review separately for each account in the name of an account holder who is subject to the creditor process without consideration for any other attributes of the account or the creditor process, including (a) the presence of other funds, from whatever source, that may be commingled in the account with funds from an emergency relief payment; (b) the existence of a co-owner on the account; and (c) the balance in the account, provided the balance is above zero dollars on the date of account review. After conducting the account review, a financial institution shall exempt from the creditor process the lesser of the sum of all posted emergency relief payments to an account between the close of business on the beginning date of the lookback period and the open of business on the ending date of the lookback period or the balance in an account when the account review is performed.If the creditor process involves a court return date, such as a garnishment, and requires a continued hold on the account, including any deposits made up to the return date, then if an emergency relief payment is deposited into an account after the completion of the account review but before the creditor process or garnishment return date and the account holder notifies the financial institution that the deposit of an emergency relief payment has been made, the financial institution must review the account. If the financial institution verifies that the deposited funds are exempt under this section, then such deposited funds shall be treated as exempt from the creditor process or garnishment. This second account review shall begin within two business days of receiving the notice from the account holder and shall cover the period from the start of business on the date of the completion of the previous account review to the end of business on the date of the notification from the account holder. For any creditor process that requires a continued hold, such as a garnishment where the account hold must continue until the garnishment return date, the account holder may access exempt funds by withdrawal as permitted by the financial institution.In its answer to the creditor process, the financial institution shall state the amount of account funds that are being held pursuant to the creditor process and the amount of account funds that were treated as exempt under this section.A financial institution that makes a good faith effort to comply with the requirements set forth herein shall not be subject to liability or regulatory action under any state law, regulation, court or other order, or regulatory interpretation for actions concerning any emergency relief payments.Emergency relief payments shall be exempt from the creditor process even if deposited into an account with a financial institution or other organization accepting deposits and thereby commingled with other funds.For the purposes of this section, no such exemption shall extend to child support, spousal support, or criminal restitution orders.

       Law governing garnishments did not apply because the monthly payment amount set by the trial court was not a garnishment but was a payment plan to allow a wife to purge herself of contempt. Wharam v. Austin, 2017

       Wage garnishments, except for enforcement of support or tax obligations, are limited to 25% of disposable income. In re Wilkinson, 196 Bankr. 311, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 595 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because this section only applies to exempt earnings that are subject to garnishment, and the debtor’s earnings or wages in this case had not been subject to a judicial or equitable proceeding of garnishment, Chapter 7 trustee’s objection to debtor’s claim of exemption under this section was well taken. In re Kluge, No. 11-61517-LYN, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5780 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Oct. 3, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankruptcy debtor improperly claimed an exemption in a portion of accounts receivable owed to the debtor for services rendered prior to the debtor’s bankruptcy since there was no pending garnishment of the debtor’s earnings and thus the protection of a percentage of the debtor’s earnings did not apply. In re Pierce, No. 15-71047, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 4372 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Dec. 30, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trustee’s objection to Chapter 13 debtor’s Amended Schedule C insofar as debtor claimed exemption in his post-petition wages was sustained because any claim of exemption for post-petition wages; whether under Virginia’s wage exemption statute or Virginia’s wildcard exemption statute, was fundamentally inconsistent with requirement that debtor devote all of his disposable income to his Chapter 13 plan. In re Cantu, 553 Bankr. 565, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2585 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016), aff'd, 713 Fed. Appx. 200, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 25487 (4th Cir. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to debtor’s deferred compensation plan (partner equity plan), debtor’s claim of exemption of 75 percent of distribution from plan was proper because distribution that debtor was entitled to receive from partner equity plan qualified as “earnings” under definition contained in statute and “exemption” meant protection from all forms of creditor process whether or not there was pending garnishment at time of bankruptcy filing. In re Foster, 556 Bankr. 233, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2963 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2016).

       This section specifically identifies the types of retirement plans for which a debtor’s exemption is limited; a debtor who participates in a plan other than of the type specified is entitled to an unlimited exemption even though such plan is functionally indistinguishable from those specified in the statute.

       Although Virginia’s exemption statutes are construed liberally, any ambiguities found in the debtor’s schedules are construed against the debtor. Thus, since filing his schedules, debtor has made no attempt to amend his exemption upward to take advantage of the maximum claim available under this section, consequently, the only portion of his interest that is exempt is $1.00.

       Bankruptcy debtor properly claimed an exemption in an individual retirement account since the debtor’s investment of account funds in a limited liability company was not a prohibited transaction for the debtor’s personal benefit under the Internal Revenue Code, and thus the account was immune from taxation and properly treated as exempt.
