     Transition provisions.
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    At its regular session of 1968, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to revise certain titles, including Title 41, relating to the Land Office. In October of 1969, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision of Title 41, which was published as House Document 9 of the 1970 session. The Commission’s draft of the revision of Title 41, became chapter 291 of the Acts of 1970. It repeals Title 41 and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 41.1.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law.
   </p>
   <p>
    Acts 1970, c. 291, cls. 4 and 5 provide as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    “4. Whenever in Title 41.1 any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 41, as such title existed prior to October 1, 1970, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article or chapter, and whenever any such former section, article or chapter is given a new number in Title 41.1, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 41 appearing elsewhere in this Code than in this title shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions or contents or portions thereof.
   </p>
   <p>
    “5. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set out herein, and if any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this act shall ever be declared unconstitutional, it shall be deemed severable, and the remainder of this act shall continue in full force and effect.”

    It appeared that appellees’ predecessor in title duly made entry on the land in 1887, pursuant to a land office treasury warrant. The county surveyor made the necessary legal survey and the affidavit required by former § 41-8. Before the applicant made the affidavit required of him by former § 41-8 and filed his proof with the application with the Register of the Land Office (now State Librarian), the General Assembly withdrew the land from patent. It was held that appellants must prevail as the patent granted to appellees’ predecessor in title was void. Powell v. Field,

Such copy and certificate shall be received in evidence in any legal proceeding in which the title to the land described in such grant, or any part thereof, is brought in controversy, and shall be prima facie evidence of title to such land; and when the land embraced in such grant, or any part thereof, shall have been regularly on the proper land books and the taxes and levies regularly assessed thereon and paid by the claimants thereof, claiming under such grant, for a continuous period of ten years, any title which may rest in the Commonwealth, to so much of the land as has been so on the land books and upon which the taxes and levies shall have been so paid, shall be relinquished to the person so claiming the same, and any such claimant of such land, on which the taxes and levies shall have been so paid, may file a petition in the circuit court of the county or city in which such land lies, after ten days’ notice in writing to the attorney for the Commonwealth for such county or city who shall appear and defend the same on behalf of the Commonwealth and the county or city; and upon satisfactory proof of the fact that such land has so been on the land books of the county or city and all the taxes and levies regularly paid thereon for the period of time hereinbefore specified, and the production before the court of the copy of such grant and the certificate of the Librarian of Virginia, hereinbefore provided for, the court shall make an order which shall recite and set forth all of such facts so proved and shown, which order, when so made and entered of record on the proper order book of the court, shall operate to effectually relinquish to the person so claiming such land through and under such grant, whatever right and title may rest in the Commonwealth, thereto; and a copy of such order shall be conclusive evidence of the better right of the claimant under such grant, in any caveat proceeding, or in any other controversy between such claimant and any other person claiming under a location of such land or any part thereof, made after the date of such order.

    In a suit to have set aside — so far as it had effect upon the title to the coal estate — a grant under the provisions of § 2504 of the Code of 1942 regulating the purchase of waste and unappropriated lands, the evidence showed that the land so granted was settled continuously for more than five years prior to the date of the grant. Hence, under the terms of this section, the land was not waste or unappropriated and the grant was void as to the surface estate; and this result inured to the benefit of the owner of the coal estate, for the owner of the surface is presumed to hold possession for the benefit of the owner of the minerals.
