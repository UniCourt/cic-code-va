      Statute mandates that an employer, who relied on permissive language of an earlier version of Form VRS-180 rather than the plain wording of the statute, notify the Virginia Retirement System Board of its final determination that an employee was convicted of a felony that ‘arose from misconduct occurring on or after July 1, 2011, in any position in which the person was a member covered for retirement purposes under any retirement system administered by the Board. See opinion of Attorney General to Andrew R. McRoberts, Esquire, Essex County Attorney, No. 16-024, 2017 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/18/17).

      <p>
       The constitutionality of former provisions contained in § 51-76 of the former Virginia Retirement Act, authorizing investment in bonds, notes, etc., evidencing loans from the Literary Fund, was challenged on two grounds: (1) that counties were permitted to contract, without approval by election, obligations which former § 115a of the Constitution [see now Va. Const., Art. VII, § 10] declared must have such approval; and (2) that after the bonds or notes were acquired by the Virginia Retirement System, interest paid by counties and cities would no longer be applied to school purposes, as required by former § 135 of the Constitution [see now Va. Const., Art. VIII, § 2]. In a mandamus proceeding brought by the Attorney General the questions were presented to the Supreme Court. The mandamus was denied. A careful examination of the opinions of the Court is necessary to determine the ultimate holdings on the questions involved. Almond v. Gilmer,

     <p>
      The members of any annuity fund, benevolent association, or retirement system of any political subdivision, hereafter referred to as a local pension system, may elect to become members of the retirement system by submitting to the Board a petition duly signed by a majority of the members.
      The Board may approve the participation of such members in the retirement system as though the local pension system was not in operation, and the provisions of this article shall thereupon apply.
      Existing pensioners or annuitants of the local pension system who are being paid pensions on the effective date of coverage and former employees whose rights are vested may retain their rights under the local pension system and be paid at their existing rates by the retirement system.
      After the local pension system is discontinued, the rates may be increased by all future percentage increases which are granted to beneficiaries retired under the provisions of this chapter.

      If deemed practicable by the Board, any cash and securities credited to the local pension system shall be transferred to the retirement system as of the effective date of coverage. The administrative head of the local pension system shall certify the proportion of the funds of the system that represents the accumulated contributions and the relative shares of the members.
      If appropriate, the accumulated contributions and shares shall be credited to the individual accounts of the members in the members’ contribution account. The operation of the local pension system shall be discontinued as of the effective date of coverage.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Board determines that the transfer of funds is not practicable, the Board may enter into an agreement with the employer to coordinate any benefits payable under this chapter with any vested benefits payable under the discontinued local system.

      Acts 1980, c. 722, which amended this section, in cl. 2 provides:

      “That the provisions of this act shall not apply to any member of the retirement system on March thirty-one, nineteen hundred eighty, or to any member whose benefit is based on service rendered prior to that date, except that the provision setting forth that salary received by members of the General Assembly pursuant to §§ 14.1-17.1 and 14.1-18 [see now §§ 30-19.11 and 30-19.12] shall be deemed creditable compensation and shall apply to all such members on the effective date of this act [July 1, 1980].”

      Every employer shall file all reports and pay all contributions and insurance premiums required by this title or Board regulation.

The Board may waive all or a part of the penalty and interest if good cause is shown. Delinquent contributions, insurance premiums, penalties, and interest may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

        Relationship with social security benefits. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that the claimant was awarded disability retirement through state retirement services, which was governed by Virginia law was not binding on the administrative law judge; the claimant’s inability to perform his past relevant work as an outreach counselor did not mean that he was disabled for the purposes of receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Act; if a plaintiff was found to be unable to perform past relevant work, the judge then considered whether the plaintiff could perform other work consistent with his residual functional capacity and vocational profile. In other words, an inability to perform past relevant work did not automatically translate to a finding of disabled under the Act and it was clear that the claimant was able to perform other, less stressful work.

       Denial of disability retirement benefits was supported by substantial evidence where: (1) the Medical Board examined the employee’s medical reports and records and testimony three separate times and recommended denial because the employee did not show he was physically or mentally incapacitated for further duty performance; (2) the Virginia Retirement System upheld the independent fact finder’s finding, made after the independent fact finder considered the Board’s recommendations, the medical records and the employee’s testimony, that the employee did not meet the requirements under this section; and (3) the employee’s medical evidence did not compel a different finding.

       Virginia Retirement System (VRS) erred in denying a teacher’s application for permanent disability benefits because the VRS misapplied the statute and held the teacher to a higher standard of “will be permanent” when analyzing the teacher’s claim instead of “likely to be permanent,” the job that the teacher was seeking disability from — teaching elementary school — was what should control the analysis of disability, not any subsequent job she might have, the teacher presented more than a mere scintilla of evidence that her numerous illnesses were “likely to be permanent,” and using the correct statutory language did not cure the consistent and incorrect misapplication of the standard.

      <p>
       The purpose of the provision stating that any allowance payable to a member who retires from a cause compensable under the worker’ compensation act shall be reduced by the amount of any payments under the act is to prevent “double-dipping,” or receiving payment from two state agencies for the same loss.

       As applied to a member who receives an award of worker’s compensation benefit for the loss of use of some part of his or her body, this section is ambiguous and is to be construed so as to permit a reduction in retirement benefits for wage loss or death benefits paid to or on behalf of the member but not for permanent loss of use benefits.

       Once the employee is entitled to remove the funds from the system, by reason of his ceasing to be an employee, the refund may no longer be immune from process. Under former section, once a member “ceases to be an employee, otherwise than by death or retirement” he is entitled to a refund of his contributions. However, the funds are no longer immune from creditors when they are withdrawn in such a manner. Virginia v. Haley, 41 Bankr. 44, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5928 (Bankr. W.D.

        The federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction

       over a suit to enjoin the removal of a general district court judge and his wife from the rolls of the Virginia Retirement System following his removal from office since such a suit would require a review of the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court removing the judge from office and a relitigation of federal questions decided in the state court. The proper forum for federal review was the United States Supreme Court on appeal or by writ of certiorari. Maurice v. Board of Dirs., 450 F. Supp. 755, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13054 (E.D.

        Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system properly dismissed. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealth’s judicial retirement system covering them were unconstitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985).

        Section related to goal of making retired judges available for recall. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision to deny retirement benefits to retired judges who appear in Virginia courts and eschew all recall service is fairly and substantially related to the permissible goal of maintaining a pool of retired judges who are willing to serve if recalled. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).

      <p>
       <b>
        Statute’s distinction between retired judges who appear in court and those who do not appear
       </b>
       bears a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of avoiding an appearance of impropriety or partiality. Statute was clearly designed, at least in part, to avoid an appearance of impropriety. The fact that a retired judge, between stints on the bench, publicly represents a private party raises questions about his impartiality. This appearance of partisanship is diminished where the retired judge works anonymously and behind the scenes for his clients. An appearance in court makes public the potentially conflicting roles occupied by a retired judge who acts interchangeably as an interested advocate and a disinterested jurist. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).

      <p>
       It is an eminently reasonable distinction to allow nonjudicial retirees to litigate in courts of the Commonwealth without having to forego their pensions, while retired judges who insist on litigating must do without. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985).

        It is entirely reasonable to provide sanctions to discourage retired judges from acting as litigators,
       </b>
       whether or not they serve on a recall basis. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985).

       <b>
        Statute’s distinction between judges and other retired government attorneys
       </b>
       bears a fair and substantial relation to the permissible governmental purpose of avoiding the appearance of impropriety for two reasons. First, unlike retired judges, other retired government attorneys are not subject to recall. Second, the roles of a judge and of other types of government attorneys are obviously different. A government attorney other than a judge is an advocate. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).

        Allowing only judges under 70 to defer retirement does not violate equal protection. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature’s decision to force retired judges to choose between receiving retirement benefits and making appearances in court is fairly and substantially related to permissible goals. That judges under age 70 are allowed to postpone this choice by deferring retirement is purely a matter of legislative grace. Because judges over 70 are not a suspect class and there is no fundamental right to deferred retirement, the distinction satisfies equal protection since it has a rational basis. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).

        Authority to discipline violator. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because violations of former section bear a substantial relationship to an attorney’s fitness to practice law, the Virginia State Bar has authority to discipline a violator. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission and the Virginia State Bar have authority to punish violations of this section. Violations of former section reflect on the violator’s fitness to decide cases as a judge. The Commission has exclusive authority to determine how a violator’s fitness as a judge is affected and to sanction the violator in his capacity as a judge. But, in addition to its relevance to fitness to sit as judge, a violation of former section undoubtedly bears on the violator’s fitness to practice law. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Inquiries of Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission and Virginia State Bar into alleged violations potentially overlap.
       </b>
       Both entities must first determine whether a violation has in fact occurred. To avoid the potential for conflicting determination on whether a violation has in fact occurred, the State Bar might justifiably refer this issue to the Commission. But once it has been determined that a violation has occurred, the Commission and the State Bar each have separate authority to impose sanctions. While the Commission has authority to discipline a violator in his capacity as a judge, the State Bar has authority to discipline a violator in his capacity as an attorney. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984).

     <p>
      Each insured employee shall contribute to the cost of his insurance an amount to be determined by the Board but not to exceed the rate of $0.70 per month for each $1,000 of annual salary. If the annual salary is not an even multiple of $1,000, annual salary shall be considered to be the next higher $1,000. The employer shall deduct the premium from the salary payable to the insured employee. An employee who is paid on other than a monthly basis shall have an amount deducted at a proportionate rate, adjusted to the nearest cent. All deductions shall be retained by or paid to the State Treasurer to the credit of the Board and shall be available to the Board for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit any employer from making the contributions required herein for his employees, in whole or in part.

      If the premium is not deducted from the employee’s salary and the failure to deduct is not the fault of the employee, the employee shall be insured and the employee shall not be required to pay the amount which should have been deducted.

      Employees retired for service or disability shall not be required to contribute to the cost of their life insurance. If an employee is separated from the service of any public institution of higher education or of any local school board prior to completing a school year, the premiums paid shall be accepted and retained as proper to date of separation. If a state employee of a public institution of higher education or a teaching hospital affiliated with a public institution of higher education (i) is employed pursuant to a contract (a) that is for a term of employment of at least nine months and (b) that does not coincide with the normal scholastic year, and (ii) separated from service prior to completing the contract year, the premiums paid shall be accepted and retained as proper to the date of separation.

       Although a county’s power to determine who was an employee’s “dependent” for purposes of the county’s self-funded benefit program was fairly and necessarily implied in the statute authorizing the establishment of such a program, the county’s inclusion of domestic partners of employees was not a reasonable implementation of the county’s authority and was an ultra vires act; it was clear that the general assembly in leaving the definition of dependent to the local governing bodies which adopt self-funded health insurance benefit plans did not contemplate adoption of a definition that does not require some aspect of financial dependence rather than mere financial interdependence.

A member shall receive service credit for military leave, provided that he returns to full-time employment within 90 days of discharge and such discharge is other than dishonorable. A member shall receive service credit while on service-connected total or partial disability as defined in § 8. A member shall not receive service credit while on nonservice-connected total or partial disability, as defined in § 8. A member shall receive service credit for prior employment as a police officer with the county, provided that he shall return his contributions previously paid plus interest at the yearly rates earned by the system during the period the member’s contributions had been withdrawn. The Board may, in its discretion, accept a return of a member’s contribution on an installment basis on terms and conditions set by the Board. Each member may be allowed credit for accrued sick leave upon making application for retirement under this section or § 6(b) at the rate of one month for each 172 hours of accrued sick leave. In determining benefits, the Board shall grant same in the same manner as if the member had been employed during that period of time.

      “A member who has attained the compulsory retirement age of 60 and has 25 years of service credit shall be retired forthwith by the Board; provided, however, that upon approval of the Board, members employed prior to the effective date of this article who have not attained 25 years of service credit may continue in service until they attain 25 years of service credit. Any member who has 25 years of service credit prior to attaining the compulsory retirement age of 60 years may retire then or thereafter until his sixtieth birthdate upon written notification to the Board, setting forth at what time the retirement is to become effective; provided that such effective date shall be after his last day of service, but not be more than 90 days subsequent to giving such notice. Any member eligible for retirement under this paragraph with 25 years of service credit shall receive 60 percent of his average annual salary. The average annual salary is to be determined by taking the sum of the salary received during the last three years of active service and dividing said sum by three. In the event that a member has more than 25 years of service credit, he shall receive an additional two percent per year of his average annual salary for each year of service in excess of 25 years, but in no event shall his total compensation exceed 66 and two-thirds percent of his average annual salary.”

     <p>
      Any county or city operating a local retirement system which does not participate in the Virginia Retirement System and which defines as “compensation” the full compensation payable or fees earnable by its county and city treasurer, attorney for the Commonwealth, commissioner of the revenue, clerk of court, sheriff, and a deputy or employee of any such officer may be reimbursed for a portion of the employer contribution paid on behalf of any such officer, deputy, or employee.
      In such cases, the political subdivision shall, at least biennially, submit to the Compensation Board information required by the Board’s actuary for computing, at the expense of the employing political subdivision, the employer contribution rate that would be applicable if all such officers, deputies, or employees thereof were members of the Virginia Retirement System.
      The Retirement Board shall compute the employer contribution rate on the assumption that no service prior to the computation date was creditable, and no assets were allocable to such members.
      The political subdivision shall be reimbursed by the Compensation Board on the basis on which the Commonwealth pays the salaries of such officer, deputy, or employee or shares, or would share, in the excess fees from the office.

      If any person receives a disability pension or benefit under this article and subsequently becomes employed, whether full time or part time, the pensions and benefits received shall be reduced by the amount of income received which exceeds the difference between the benefits received under this section and the amount of pay to which the member would have been entitled had the member’s employment progressed in the same rank and grade with credit for the level of seniority the member would have attained had the member not been disabled. The reduction shall continue until the member would have been eligible for normal retirement, based on age and service, had the member remained uninjured and employed. For the purposes of this section,
    “income”
    means gross income received less deductions for social security taxes only.

     <p>
      Any person receiving pensions or benefits under the provisions of this section shall upon request, on or before May 1 of each year, provide a copy of all W-2 forms showing income received, or a statement under oath as to whether the member has received compensation for work performed in the previous calendar year, to the governing body of the jurisdiction providing this pension.
      Refusal to provide such documents shall be grounds for termination of benefits under this section until such documents are produced.
      Production of the documents shall be required until the person would have been eligible for normal retirement had the member remained uninjured.

     <p>
      Eligible volunteers, and all persons who subsequently become eligible volunteers, may apply to the Board for membership in the Fund. Upon becoming a member of the Fund, each eligible volunteer shall pay an amount to be set by the Board per quarter into the Fund. Each quarterly payment made by a member shall be supplemented by such contribution from the general fund of the state treasury for a period not to exceed 20 years as shall be determined by the Board and as may be appropriated by the general appropriation act. The quarterly payments shall be credited to the separate accounts of the members, and the matching contributions shall be credited to the Fund. The member contribution or any additional contribution to the Fund may be made by (i) the individual fire department or emergency medical services agency, provided it is paid for all eligible members of the Fund within the particular fire department or emergency medical services agency; (ii) local government, provided it is paid for all eligible members of the Fund who are volunteers for fire departments or emergency medical services agencies within the jurisdiction of the local government; or (iii) any other source provided it is paid for all eligible members of the Fund. Such accounts shall be kept so that they are available for payment on withdrawal from membership or upon receipt of the service award. No eligible volunteer shall maintain more than one membership in the Fund. In the event an eligible volunteer is in more than one eligible position, he must choose the position upon which his membership will be determined.
