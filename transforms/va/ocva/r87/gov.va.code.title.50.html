      </p>
      <p>
       The bankruptcy court has long been concerned with the provisions of Virginia law which are clearly contrary to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and clause (ii) of subdivision 4 of this section is one of the most obvious ones. It is that complex and often tortuous interaction between the Bankruptcy Code, state partnership law, and a general partnership agreement that causes courts consternation. In re Grablowsky, 180 Bankr. 134, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 359 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995).

        Thus, sequence of charging orders determines priority. —

      <p>
       In a proceeding under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, in which the debtor was in possession, a limited partner filed a complaint seeking a determination of the validity, priority or extent of various liens upon its property. It was held that the judgment lienholders obtained priority, if at all, in the sequence in which they were granted charging orders under this section by a court of competent jurisdiction, rather than in the order of the dates on which the writs of fieri facias were delivered to the sheriff for execution, in the absence of any evidence that any of the defendants holding judgment liens were precluded from seeking charging orders pursuant to this section.

      <p>
       Plaintiff did not cause a writ of execution to issue. Instead, it merely sought the entry of a charging order armed only with what may be best described as a “naked” final judgment. Therefore, until a charging order entered, the judgment debtor virtually was free, as against the instant plaintiff, to encumber intangible property, including her interests to discretionary distributions of a limited partnerships. A charging order, without more, does not take priority over a security interest perfected after judgment but before the entry date of the charging order. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Craun, 853 F. Supp. 209, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6811 (W.D. Va. 1994).

       Because, strictly construed, Virginia’s limited liability company (LLC) laws would not allow the court to charge outside the scope of transferable interest with respect to the property of the LLC, the court would not be able to order the LLC to provide the judgment creditors with regular financial reports as that would go beyond the language of the statute; thus, to the extent the motion for entry of charging order asked the court to require additional annual financial documents, the motion could not be granted.

     <p>
      If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges him to be incapacitated, the partner’s executor, administrator, conservator, or other legal representative may exercise all the partner’s rights for the purpose of settling his estate or administering his property including any power the partner had to give an assignee the right to become a limited partner. If a partner is a corporation, trust, or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.

However, a provision of a limited partnership’s partnership agreement purporting to authorize the limited partnership to approve a merger by a less than unanimous vote of the partners shall be effective to permit approval of a merger by a less than unanimous vote only if either (i) the partnership agreement included that provision at the time each partner who does not vote in favor of the merger became bound by the agreement, or (ii) the provision was added to the partnership agreement through an amendment to which each partner who does not vote in favor of the merger specifically consented.

       Trial court erred by awarding tax damages against defendants in a derivative action since such damages were not sustained by the partnership and, thus, were not recoverable in the derivative suit. In so concluding, the reviewing court determined that a shareholder in a derivative proceeding may obtain monetary damages, although any recovery belonged to the corporation and not the shareholder and that the same principles applied in the context of a derivative suit filed on behalf of a limited partnership.

       Where the parties to a contract intended to associate themselves, not merely as co-owners of a tract of land to be resold, but to pool their land and money, and in some instances talent and labor, for the improvement of the property, and the venture contemplated more than mere association for speculation in land for resale (an arrangement which itself has been held to be a partnership) with the improvement of the land being of the essence of the agreement, and to this improvement each contributed something and each anticipated a profit in return, it was held that the intent of parties, so strongly manifested by the agreement, considered together with the business transactions and the conduct of the parties subsequent to the agreement, furnished conclusive evidence that a partnership existed.

      <p>
       The defendant firm’s threshold burden in this case was to establish that the plaintiff was a party to the 1989 agreement and its non-competition clause. It is permissible for existing partnerships to associate with individuals for the purpose of forming new partnerships, and the formation of the new partnership with the plaintiff had nothing to do with the 1989 agreement, and therefore the burden was not met and the plaintiff was not a party to the 1989 agreement.

       Plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement regarding the sale, refurbishing, and possible resale of a home; the agreement did not contemplate future endeavors. As the parties’ agreement was a single transaction, rather than the “carrying on” of a business for profit, it did not rise to the definition of a partnership arrangement. Kiszely v. Yi, 70 Va. Cir. 364, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 54 (Fairfax County Apr. 11, 2006).

       It is generally agreed that in order to constitute a partnership as to third persons, it is essential that the parties charged as partners have a community of interest as common owners of the business which constitutes the joint undertaking. This community of interest must be of such nature as makes each member a coprincipal and an agent of all members with joint authority or right in the administration, control and disposal of the business or its property.

       Where the only evidence that a partnership existed was the joint ownership of the property as tenants in common and the splitting of proceeds and expenses, there was no written partnership agreement or oral agreement, the individual interests in the land were dealt with separately, there were no jointly held partnership funds, the property used in the farming operation was not acquired in the partnership name, partnership tax returns were not filed, and there was a delay in filing a partnership certificate, the debtor was not a partnership.

        Agreement contemplating single transaction did not create partnership. —

      <p>
       Plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement regarding the sale, refurbishing, and possible resale of a home; the agreement did not contemplate future endeavors. As the parties’ agreement was a single transaction, rather than the “carrying on” of a business for profit, it did not rise to the definition of a partnership arrangement. Kiszely v. Yi, 70 Va. Cir. 364, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 54 (Fairfax County Apr. 11, 2006).

       Sufficient evidence showed a withdrawing partner and a continuing partner entered into a partnership, despite not adhering to certain formalities, because the evidence showed (1) the parties orally agreed to carry on a business for profit, which occurred, and (2) the withdrawing partner was paid part of the businesses’ profits.

All income received from that property that ended up in the partnership coffers came as a loan from father, and he had to reimburse all of those expenses that were paid by the partnership. Woodie v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Former §§ 50-9 and 50-10 spell out the extent of a partner’s authority to act for and bind the partnership in the absence of any express authority. However, implicit in these rules is the fundamental rule of agency law that where the partner’s act is authorized, as where the other partners consent to the act, the partnership is bound thereby. In determining whether such consent exists, the rules of agency law apply. In re Decker, 295 F. Supp. 501, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13331 (W.D. Va. 1969), aff'd, Woodson v. Gilmer, 420 F.2d 378, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10951 (4th Cir. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consent may arise by means of an express or implied agreement, and may be inferred from the conduct of the partners either before or after the act of the partner. Where this consent of all the partners exists, a partner may assign his interest in specific partnership property to his other partner, or partners, or to a third party either for his own or for partnership purposes. In re Decker, 295 F. Supp. 501, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13331 (W.D. Va. 1969), aff'd, Woodson v. Gilmer, 420 F.2d 378, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10951 (4th Cir. 1970).

       It is settled law in Virginia, both by statute and in numerous decisions, that a partner is an agent of the firm for the purpose of the partnership business, and may bind all partners by his acts within the scope of such business. It is of no consequence whether the partner is acting in good faith with his copartners or not, provided the act is within the scope of the partnership’s business and professedly for the firm, and third persons are acting in good faith.

      <p>
       Former §§ 50-9 and 50-10 spell out the extent of a partner’s authority to act for and bind the partnership in the absence of any express authority. However, implicit in these rules is the fundamental rule of agency law that where the partner’s act is authorized, as where the other partners consent to the act, the partnership is bound thereby. In determining whether such consent exists, the rules of agency law apply. In re Decker, 295 F. Supp. 501, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13331 (W.D. Va. 1969), aff'd, Woodson v. Gilmer, 420 F.2d 378, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10951 (4th Cir. 1970) (decided under former § 50-10).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consent may arise by means of an express or implied agreement, and may be inferred from the conduct of the partners either before or after the act of the partner. Where this consent of all the partners exists, a partner may assign his interest in specific partnership property to his other partner, or partners, or to a third party either for his own or for partnership purposes. In re Decker, 295 F. Supp. 501, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13331 (W.D. Va. 1969), aff'd, Woodson v. Gilmer, 420 F.2d 378, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10951 (4th Cir. 1970) (decided under former § 50-10).

       If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner’s consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner.

If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.
