        Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system held properly dismissed. —

      <p>
       Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealth’s judicial retirement system covering them were unconstitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178).

       <b>
        Virginia acted reasonably in setting up its recall system,
       </b>
       whether it be obligatory or merely discretionary, for retired judges under 70 years of age. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178).

        Purpose of recall/retirement system. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear purpose of the recall/retirement system is to insure the availability of a pool of auxiliary judges so that Virginia courts can more effectively address the problem of case backlogs. This system of benefits and burdens is rationally calculated to achieve this legitimate purpose; its general structure is well within any limitations imposed by the equal protection clause. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section, by giving retired judges over 70 discretion to refuse recall, strikes a sensible balance
       </b>
       between the needs of the recall system, on the one hand, and the realities of aging, on the other. The Constitution does not forbid this eminently reasonable accommodation of conflicting concerns. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178).

       The burden was upon defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were denied a public trial.

        It is not the practice in this State, and indeed it would be physically impossible, for the clerk to record all of the orders on the order book immediately, or for the judge forthwith to sign them. The universal practice is that the clerk extends the orders upon the permanent record of the court just as soon as possible, and they are thereafter read in open court and signed as orders of the date when the judgments were pronounced.

      Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 524 and 542, cl. 17 provides: “That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 1289 of the Acts of Assembly of 2020 requires the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.”

        Clerk must transact business during convenient hours. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a violation of the spirit of this section to permit a public officer to transact public business outside of his usual and convenient hours, so that among those entitled to an equal opportunity, one or more shall receive preferential treatment. It will, perhaps, be admitted that one cannot require a clerk of court to perform a public service outside of the convenient hours adopted for the transaction of business and outside of his office. It ought not, therefore, to be left to the public official to voluntarily assume such responsibility, especially when the rights of others are affected thereby. Brumley v. Grimstead,

       While not required by statute to be kept open during specified hours, the office hours for the transaction of business shall be “during convenient hours.” It can hardly be seriously contended that the hours between 12:00 midnight and 8:00 a.m. may be considered convenient, either for the great majority of persons having business to transact at that office, or for the employees of the office.

      <p>
       Clerk of court can close the office when a county has failed to adopt a budget and the clerk cannot pay his employees. A clerk, or the employees of the clerk’s office, can serve on a volunteer basis until the budget impasse is resolved. To the extent particular functions, including electronic filing procedures, can be kept operational in the absence of funding from the county and without staffing, the clerk should do so.

        The words “or proper”
       </b>
       have been inserted in the statute since the decision of Commonwealth v. Williamson, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 554 (1847), wherein it was held that a clerk, under the statute as it then was, had no authority, when applied to for a marriage license, to examine a witness on oath as to the age of the parties. The court construed the law as it then stood to apply only to such cases in which, without regard to circumstances, the making of the affidavit was necessary as a prerequisite to the performance of the official act required of the clerk. But the legislature soon after that decision, by the revisal of 1849 having amended the law by inserting the words above recited, evidently designed to authorize the clerks and their deputies to administer an oath in such cases, because it is highly proper that the clerk, before issuing a marriage license to parties who had not the consent of parents or guardians, or such evidence of it as the law required, should have authority to examine a witness on oath as to the age of the parties. The authority is given by the statute as it now stands. Maybush v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 857, 1878 Va. LEXIS 22 (1878) (decided under prior law).

       If no deficiencies exist as to a deed’s form or in the fees tendered, a homestead deed is admitted to record when properly received by the clerk’s office. To hold otherwise would deny debtor’s rights, as given to him by the legislature, and make them contingent to the malfeasance of an individual clerk who should have properly performed the duties of the office.

       The intent of the amendment of 1926, which added the third sentence, was to abolish admission to record by mere mental act, and to make the physical act of endorsing on the document the day and time of day of admission the one and only act capable of evidencing admission to record. To hold that a deed may be admitted to record by mere mental act on the part of the clerk is simply to ignore and nullify the amendment of 1926. Fooshee v. Snavely, 58 F.2d 772, 1931 U.S. Dist.

     <p>
      Clerk of court can close the office when a county has failed to adopt a budget and the clerk cannot pay his employees. A clerk, or the employees of the clerk’s office, can serve on a volunteer basis until the budget impasse is resolved. To the extent particular functions, including electronic filing procedures, can be kept operational in the absence of funding from the county and without staffing, the clerk should do so. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Jack Kennedy, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Wise County and City of Norton, 11-063, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 34 (6/22/11).

        Fee for documents with and without plat. —

      <p>
       Subdivision A 2 requires a clerk to charge the fee for recording a document without a plat, plus the one dollar fee required by subdivision A 1 for admitting a writing to record; for recording a document “in conjunction with such plat,” the clerk should charge the amended fee for the document and the amended fee plus the one dollar fee required by subdivision A 1 for the plat, and a document recorded with an attached plat is exempt from such fee. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Marilyn L. Wilson, Clerk, Circuit Court of Amelia County, and The Honorable John T. Frey, Clerk, Circuit Court of Fairfax County, 01-071 (11/27/01).

        Recordation taxes on documents intended to allow individuals of the Islamic faith to acquire real estate without violating a tenet of their religion. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit court clerk should base the recordation taxes for a “Security Instrument,” which allows for the payment of profits as opposed to a traditional deed of trust that is secured by a note requiring the payment of interest, on the original acquisition balance as defined in the instrument, and should assess separate fees for recording an “Assignment Agreement,” since the document contains two instruments of equal dignity that serve independent purposes at law.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any county, city, or town, through its governing body, may assess an additional sum not in excess of $5 as part of the costs in each criminal or traffic case in the district or circuit courts located where such cases are brought in which the defendant is charged with a violation of any statute or ordinance, which violation in the case of towns arose within the town, and where the defendant is charged with a violation of any such statute or ordinance by a local law-enforcement agency. The imposition of such assessment shall be by ordinance of the governing body, which may provide for different sums in circuit courts and district courts. The assessment shall be collected by the clerk of the court in which the action is filed, remitted to the treasurer of the appropriate county, city, or town, and held by such treasurer subject to disbursements by the governing body to a local law-enforcement agency solely to fund software, hardware, and associated equipment costs for the implementation and maintenance of an electronic summons system. The imposition of a town assessment shall replace any county fee that would otherwise apply.

      In the City of Richmond and in the City of Newport News, the clerk of the circuit court shall be paid a salary by the city of not less than the amount which would be allowed to be retained by the respective clerks under state law. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent such clerks from receiving any future increases that may be allowed clerks of circuit courts from time to time by the General Assembly.

     <p>
      Such salaries shall be in full compensation for services and shall be in lieu of the retention by such clerks of any and all official fees, commissions and emoluments of whatever kind or character, and from whatever source derived; and the city council of each such city shall provide for the payment of such salaries out of the city treasury in equal biweekly, semimonthly or monthly installments. The expenses of office of such clerks, including the compensation of all deputies and employees, shall likewise be paid to each such clerk out of the city treasury on duly authenticated vouchers when and as such expenses are incurred or may become due and payable or at least monthly. The maximum amount of such expenses shall be fixed by the Compensation Board, and the Board shall fix the number and compensation of the deputies and employees of each such clerk.
     </p>
     <p>
      All fees, commissions, and emoluments of every kind or character received or collected by such clerks, and from whatever source derived, shall be paid into the city treasury by such clerks monthly. All fees, commissions, and emoluments of every kind and character whether payable by the Commonwealth, the United States, or by private persons, firms or corporations, now or hereafter made receivable by laws or ordinance by such clerks, shall continue to be paid to and collected by such clerks and shall be paid into the city treasury monthly, except that the city aforesaid shall not be required to pay any such clerk any fees or commissions for services performed for such city.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the City of Newport News, nothing in this section shall be construed to affect or remove any of such clerks, their deputies, or employees from coverage by the Virginia Retirement System, but they shall remain in such system, and the city shall pay to the Virginia Retirement System such amount as the Commonwealth would have been required to pay had such clerks, deputies and employees continued to be compensated under other provisions of former Article 3 (§ 14.1-136 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 14.1, and the city shall deduct from the salaries paid such clerks, their deputies and employees the employee contribution to the Virginia Retirement System as provided by law.

      The Supreme Court may sit and render final judgment en banc or in divisions, as may be prescribed by rules of the Court not inconsistent with the provisions of this section. No decision shall become the judgment of the Court, however, except on the concurrence of at least three justices, and no law shall be declared unconstitutional under either the Constitution of Virginia or the Constitution of the United States except on the concurrence of at least a majority of all justices of the Supreme Court. If the justices composing any division differ as to the judgment to be rendered in any cause or if any justice of such division, within a time and in a manner to be fixed by the rules of the Court, shall certify that in his opinion any decision of such division of the Court is in conflict with a prior decision of the Court, or of one of the divisions thereof, the case shall be reheard and decided by the Court sitting en banc.

      The Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus and prohibition to the circuit and district courts, the Court of Appeals, and to the State Corporation Commission and in all other cases in which such writs, respectively, would lie according to the principles of the common law. Provided that no writ of mandamus, prohibition or any other summary process whatever shall issue in any case of the collection of revenue or attempt to collect the same, or to compel the collecting officers to receive anything in payment of taxes except such money as is legal tender for the payment of revenue, or in any case arising out of the collection of revenue in which the applicant for the writ of process has any other remedy adequate for the protection and enforcement of his individual right, claim and demand, if just.

        Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system held properly dismissed. —
       </b>

      <p>
       Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealth’s judicial retirement system covering them were unconstitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178).

      <p>
       <b>
        Virginia acted reasonably in setting up its recall system,
       </b>
       whether it be obligatory or merely discretionary, for retired judges under 70 years of age. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under former § 51-178).

        Purpose of recall/retirement system. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear purpose of the recall/retirement system is to insure the availability of a pool of auxiliary judges so that Virginia courts can more effectively address the problem of case backlogs. This system of benefits and burdens is rationally calculated to achieve this legitimate purpose; its general structure is well within any limitations imposed by the equal protection clause. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section, by giving retired judges over 70 discretion to refuse recall, strikes a sensible balance
       </b>
       between the needs of the recall system, on the one hand, and the realities of aging, on the other. The Constitution does not forbid this eminently reasonable accommodation of conflicting concerns. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178).

        Retired judge under 70 must serve if recalled. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of subsection D of former § 51-178 is plain and unmistakable. It could not be clearer: A retired judge under 70 must serve if recalled. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984) (decided under former § 51-178).

       A judicial emergency may be declared as provided in this section when a disaster, as defined in § 44-146.16, substantially endangers or impedes the operation of a court, the ability of persons to avail themselves of the court, or the ability of litigants or others to have access to the court or to meet schedules or time deadlines imposed by court order, rule, or statute. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or, if the Chief Justice is unavailable, the justice longest in continuous service who is available, shall have the power to declare by order a judicial emergency (i) for any court upon the request of the Governor, (ii) for the Supreme Court sua sponte, (iii) for the Court of Appeals, upon the request of the chief judge of the Court of Appeals or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the judge of the Court of Appeals longest in continuous service who is available, or (iv) for any circuit or district court upon the request of the chief judge of the affected circuit or district court or, if the chief judge is unavailable, the judge from the affected circuit or district court longest in continuous service who is available.

       Any order declaring a judicial emergency shall specify (i) the court or courts and facilities affected by the order; (ii) the nature of the disaster necessitating the order; (iii) the time period or duration of the judicial emergency; and (iv) any other information relevant to the suspension or restoration of court operations, including but not limited to extension of deadlines. The order shall become effective for each affected court upon the date set forth in the order or, if no date is set forth in the order, upon the date the order is signed.
      </li>
      <li id="t17.1c03a03s17.1-330ol1C">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an order declaring a judicial emergency may designate a neighboring city or county not affected by the disaster for the temporary relocation of the affected circuit or district court. Locations designated under this section may be outside the geographical limits of the affected court’s circuit or district.If an affected circuit or district court conducts sessions in a city or county not affected by the disaster pursuant to this section, the unaffected city or county shall be a proper venue for civil and criminal actions to the same extent as if the affected court were operating in its original city or county. An affected circuit court may, upon motion of either party, and for good cause shown, summon jurors from the jurisdiction where the affected circuit court has been temporarily relocated.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such order may suspend, toll, extend, or otherwise grant relief from deadlines, time schedules, or filing requirements imposed by otherwise applicable statutes, rules, or court orders in any court processes and proceedings, including all appellate court time limitations.

       The duration of the order shall be for the shortest period of time necessary under the circumstances of the emergency, but in no event shall the period exceed 21 calendar days. Any such order may be extended for additional periods not to exceed 21 calendar days by a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court, and any order of extension shall include the information required by subsection B for the issuance of an initial order. In the event of a communicable disease of public health threat, as defined in § 44-146.16, a majority of the justices of the Supreme Court may extend such order for the duration of the threat.

       Order established a 55-day deadline for filing any motions relating to the protective order or attorney fees, and that deadline remained tolled until the Virginia Supreme Court entered a judicial emergency order related to the pandemic that terminated the tolling of case-related deadlines; thus, the court reversed the circuit court’s denial of appellant’s motion for order of production and entry of a protective order based on the timeliness of its filing.

       Continuance of defendant’s criminal trial was necessitated and the time period during which the court was not conducting criminal jury or bench trials due to the COVID-19 emergency was excludable because the coronavirus pandemic constituted a natural disaster, as it was a communicable disease of public health threat, and the court found that it could not protect the health and safety of the trial participants if it conducted a jury trial in the midst of the judicial emergency and pandemic.

       Insureds’ claim against their insurer was timely filed because the Virginia Supreme Court, relying on its statutory authority, granted relief from all deadlines due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the United States Supreme Court stated that a court usually may pause the running of a limitations statute in private litigation when some extraordinary circumstance prevents the plaintiff from meeting a deadline.

       Court had jurisdiction to hear a motion for spousal support filed on the last day of the 1.5 year period for which the court reserved the issue of spousal support in the parties’ final decree of divorce because the period for which spousal support was reserved was tolled from March 16, 2020, through July 19, 2020, pursuant to this section due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just under one year had passed from entry of the final decree on March 27, 2019, and just over half of a year remained once it ended, and extending the deadline for half of a year from July 20, 2020, rendered the reinstatement on October 1, 2020, timely.

       The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus. However, only the circuit court which entered the original judgment order of conviction may issue a writ for one held under criminal process. The Supreme Court’s grant of original jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters is not subject to this limitation. However, the Court of Appeal’s grant of jurisdiction in these matters is limited.

       Court had appellate jurisdiction over matters involving divorce and judgments for civil contempt of court; thus, the issues raised in the petition for a writ of prohibition fell within the court’s subject matter jurisdiction. The court rejected the claim that a final order was necessary to invoke the court’s original jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition. Hoffman P'ship, LLP v. Circuit Court, 72 Va.

       Wife asserted in her complaint for divorce that the partnership was marital property and she asked for the right to control and manage the partnership; since the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the divorce proceedings, including the power to determine the ownership and value of all property, the writ of prohibition did not lie. The circuit court had already entered two orders directing husband, not the partnership, to undertake certain actions, and prohibition did not lie to undo those orders. Hoffman P'ship, LLP v.

       Circuit court’s order was a final order because it disposed of the whole subject, ruled on all the relief contemplated, provided with reasonable completeness for giving effect to the ruling, and left nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend ministerially the execution of the order, and as such was appealable to an appellate court. Thus, the court’s subsequent orders were of no moment in considering the finality of the original order because the jurisdiction of the trial court ceased. Knight v. Ottrix, 69 Va.

       The statutes which limit review of a death penalty case to the Supreme Court do not violate equal protection rights, as it is rational for the General Assembly, given the gravity of cases involving a sentence to death, to provide death-penalty defendants as automatic, plenary review in the Commonwealth’s highest court.

       Where court of appeals reversed and remanded for recomputation of workers’ compensation commission’s death benefit award, employer by accepting remand did not waive right to appeal from unfavorable commission decision on remand and appeals court erred in applying “law of the case” doctrine to bar consideration of the merits of employer’s appeal.

       Judge’s authority may not be delegated. —

      While the chief judge and, collectively, the judges of a judicial circuit, do possess legal authority to establish rules regarding courthouse security, such power may not be delegated to a circuit court administrator. The chief judge and, collectively, the circuit judges, possess the legal authority to establish a general rule that cellular telephones are permitted in the courthouse. Nonetheless, the sheriff possesses the legal authority to take action in any specific instance in which a cellular telephone causes a disturbance, or otherwise endangers public safety within the courthouse. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable William O. Watson, Sheriff, City of Portsmouth, 12-065, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 48 (7/12/13).

Manifestly, it seemed to the legislature that former § 8-611 furnished the most convenient place to hear the controversy.

Because defendant failed to preserve this argument in circuit court, it could not be addressed on appeal. Breznick v. Commonwealth, 2020

       It is considered as the exercise of sound discretion to forbid the imposition of costs on a party nowise in the wrong; and the very fact that an appeal will not lie from the court of chancery merely on the ground that the appellant has been improperly decreed to pay costs, renders the lower courts all the more careful in the exercise of the discretion given them on this subject. In cases of doubt or great novelty the court will refuse to award costs to either party against the other, and not infrequently the result is that each party is decreed to pay his own costs. Tabb v.

       Security for costs upon suit by nonresident.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any suit or action, except when an indigent is plaintiff, there may be a suggestion on the record in court, or, if the case be at rules, on the rule docket, by a defendant, or any officer of the court, that the plaintiff is not a resident of this Commonwealth and the security is required of him. After sixty days from such suggestion, the suit or action shall, by order of the court, be dismissed, unless, before the dismissal, it is proven that plaintiff is a resident of the Commonwealth or security be given before the court, or its clerk, for the payment of the costs and damages in the court in which the suit or action is instituted which may be awarded to the defendant, and of the fees due, or to become due, in such suit or action to the officers of the court. The security shall be by bond, payable to the Commonwealth, but there need only be one obligor therein, if he be sufficient and a resident of the Commonwealth. The court before whom, or before whose clerk, such bond is given, may, on motion by a defendant or officer, give judgment for so much as he is entitled to by virtue of such bond.

       This section, and its statutory ancestors were designed, not to deny nonresidents access to Virginia’s courts, but to insure to the defendant and to the officials of the court the payment of costs which may be awarded against a nonresident plaintiff against whom the court has no means of enforcing a collection.

       Notwithstanding the fact that this section is mandatory, the right of a defendant to require a nonresident plaintiff to give security for costs may be waived by his conduct in failing promptly to move for such security. Outlaw v. Pearce,

       Where an order was entered for security for costs, to be given within 60 days, and no security was entered within such time it was error to dismiss the suit for failure to give the security if sufficient security was offered at the time of the motion to dismiss.

      <p>
       Under this section, when a Virginia resident, named as a defendant in a suit or action brought in a Virginia court by a nonresident plaintiff, files a suggestion of nonresidency, the plaintiff is required to post a bond for costs and damages. If he fails to do so within 60 days, the statute authorizes the court to dismiss the case. The court cannot, however, exercise that authority if “before the dismission . . . security be given.” Chagnon v. Hofferman,

      <p>
       The lower court having complied with the mandatory provisions of this section, in requiring complainant, a nonresident, to give security for costs, was only bound to exercise reasonable discretion in regard to any subsequent motion for increase of the security, and where such a motion was not passed upon until after the court had decided the merits of the case adversely to the defendant, its refusal by the same decree which disposed of all the other questions to order additional security was reasonable and natural.

However, no sums for attendance and mileage shall be allowed a witness from outside the Commonwealth, in any civil action, unless the judge of the court determines and certifies that the witness is a material witness in the matter for which he appeared. The court may allow such mileage and attendance fee or any portion thereof as the court may determine to be reasonable under the circumstances of the case. A witness summoned to attend in several cases may have the entry made against either of the parties by whom he is summoned, but no witness shall be allowed reimbursement for his attendance in more than one case at the same time. Every witness who qualifies as an expert witness, when compelled to attend and testify, shall be allowed such compensation and mileage as the court may, if requested in its discretion, order without regard to any limitation described above, but the same shall be paid by the party in whose behalf he shall testify.

       Purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly, to ensure the imposition of appropriate and just criminal penalties, and to make the most efficient use of correctional resources, especially for the effective incapacitation of violent criminal offenders, has determined that it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to develop, implement, and revise discretionary sentencing guidelines. The purposes of the Commission established under this chapter are to assist the judiciary in the imposition of sentences by establishing a system of discretionary guidelines and to establish a discretionary sentencing guidelines system which emphasizes accountability of the offender and of the criminal justice system to the citizens of the Commonwealth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission shall develop discretionary sentencing guidelines to achieve the goals of certainty, consistency, and adequacy of punishment with due regard to the seriousness of the offense, the dangerousness of the offender, deterrence of individuals from committing criminal offenses and the use of alternative sanctions, where appropriate.

       Commission created; membership and terms of office.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is created a Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission in the judiciary branch of government, composed of seven persons who shall be citizens and residents of the Commonwealth. The members of the Commission shall be chosen by the vote of a majority of the members elected to each house of the General Assembly. The Commission shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman annually from its membership.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission shall consist of three judicial members, who shall be (i) one active judge of a circuit court, (ii) one active judge of a general district court and (iii) one active judge of a juvenile and domestic relations district court; two lawyer members, who shall be active members of the Virginia State Bar who are not judges and who have practiced law in the Commonwealth for 15 or more years immediately preceding their appointment; and two public members who shall not be active or retired judges and shall never have been licensed lawyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the initial appointments, the term of office of each member shall be four years commencing on July 1. No member of the Commission shall be eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms. The remainder of any term to which a member is appointed to fill a vacancy shall not constitute a term in determining the member’s eligibility for reappointment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commission membership terminates whenever a member resigns or ceases to possess the qualifications that made him eligible for appointment. During any vacancy, which may exist while the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may appoint a successor to serve until
      30 days after the commencement of the next session of the General Assembly. Upon election of a successor by the General Assembly, the new member of the Commission shall serve for the remainder of the term of office of his predecessor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of the Commission who is the subject of an investigation or hearing by it or is otherwise personally involved therein shall be disqualified by the Commission from acting in such proceedings. In such a case the Governor shall appoint a person possessing the original qualifications of such member as prescribed by this section to serve temporarily as a substitute member of the Commission in such proceedings.

     <p>
      The Commission is vested with the power, and it shall be its duty, to investigate charges arising out of the present or any prior term of office which would be the basis for retirement, censure, or removal of a judge under Article VI, Section 10 of the Constitution of Virginia and the provisions of this chapter even though the subject judge may have been reelected to a new term of office.

     <p>
      The Commission, after such investigation as it deems necessary, may order and conduct hearings at such times and places in the Commonwealth as it shall determine.

     <p>
      If the Commission finds the charges to be well-founded, and sufficient to constitute the basis for retirement, censure, or removal of a judge, it may file a formal complaint before the Supreme Court.

      The Commission shall have the authority to make rules, not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter or of general law, to govern investigations and hearings conducted by it.

      <p>
       Supreme Court of Virginia does not give due weight to the Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission’s findings or their credibility determinations, instead, the court will accord the Commission’s findings only such weight, if any, as the court deems appropriate in each case. This is so because the Commission’s function is only to determine whether the charges are well-founded, and sufficient to constitute the basis for retirement, censure, or removal of a judge, thus resulting in a complaint being filed in the court.

       Despite the claims of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission that the terms discussed in a judge’s disciplinary hearings had not yet been approved and were never reduced to a formal supervision agreement, the Commission had no right to file a complaint against the judge in the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to Va.

       . While the judge accepted the Commission’s terms in writing, the agreement was not in writing, nothing required it to be in writing, and a valid supervision agreement had been reached; the Commission’s concerns that it would not sign an agreement until its chairman and members had approved the document reflected concerns of form rather than substance, and the Court was not inclined to place form over substance.

       A statement was made that the terms would be reduced to writing, but the Chairman also indicated that the judge could inform others that he would return to the bench; thus, no gag order was imposed, the judge’s statements to others that “everything would be OK” did not constitute a breach of the agreement, and he made no representation that the Commission had exonerated him or vindicated him.

        Applicability.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       By law, records of proceedings before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission were kept confidential; the mandamus filed by the judge was not a formal complaint filed with the Virginia Supreme Court, and the mandate of confidentiality applied. In re Bennett, 871 S.E.2d 445, 2022 Va. LEXIS 27 (Va. 2022).

        The First Amendment does not permit the criminal punishment of third persons who are strangers to the inquiry
       </b>
       for divulging or publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the Commonwealth’s interest in protecting the reputation of its judges, nor in maintaining the institutional integrity of its courts is sufficient to justify the subsequent punishment of speech of third persons who are strangers to the inquiry divulging truthful information regarding the confidential proceedings of the Commission. Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829, 98 S. Ct. 1535, 56 L. Ed. 2d 1, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 84 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The risk of injury to the judge under inquiry, to the system of justice, or to the operation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, created by the divulging by third persons of truthful information regarding the confidential proceedings of the Commission falls short of a clear and present danger to the orderly administration of justice.
