     <p>
      It is the policy of the Commonwealth to encourage and enable persons with disabilities to participate fully and equally in the social and economic life of the Commonwealth and to engage in remunerative employment. To these ends, the General Assembly directs the Governor; the Virginia Board for People with Disabilities; the Departments of Education, Health, Housing and Community Development, Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, and Social Services; the Departments for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, the Blind and Vision Impaired, and the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing; and such other agencies as the Governor deems appropriate to provide, in a comprehensive and coordinated manner that makes the best use of available resources, those services necessary to assure equal opportunity to persons with disabilities in the Commonwealth.

       therefore, plaintiff, who said she was disabled by chronic fatigue syndrome, could not maintain state common-law wrongful discharge claim. Mannell v. American Tobacco Co., 871 F. Supp. 854, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17248 (E.D. Va. 1994).

      <p>
       The policy against discrimination because of disability expressed in this act is also expressed in the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA) and the amendments to the VHRA limiting causes of action to those afforded by other federal or state civil rights statutes or local ordinances bar any claim for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy embodied in both this act and the VHRA. Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 374, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19719 (E.D. Va. 1998), aff'd, 33 Fed. Appx. 49, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 5982 (4th Cir. 2002).

        Applicable to all employers. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature intended the term “no employer” in subdivision A to mean just that and did not propose to limit the meaning to the state employers, public schools, and other employers supported by public funds, thus, cause of action was available under this section against private employer. Yates v. Volunteer Health Care Sys., 783 F. Supp. 1002, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2360 (W.D. Va. 1992).

        Employees who could proceed under Rehabilitation Act. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Virginians with Disabilities Act’s (VDA) explicit statement that it does not apply to employers covered by the Rehabilitation Act indicates that the General Assembly did not intend employees who could proceed against their employers under the Rehabilitation Act to be able to proceed under the VDA, which is the exclusive state law remedy. Mannell v. American Tobacco Co., 871 F. Supp. 854, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17248 (E.D. Va. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Virginia’s public policy against disability discrimination is manifested through the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VDA), and because the VDA contains an exclusivity provision, plaintiff’s action for disability discrimination must be pursued under the VDA and not as a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Stafford v. Radford Community Hosp., 908 F. Supp. 1369, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12050 (W.D. Va. 1995), dismissed, No. 94-1096-R, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 523 (W.D. Va. Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d 262, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 27389 (4th Cir. 1997).

        Subsection B not limitation on cause of action. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the language of subsection B of this section limits discrimination in state service, in public schools, or in other employment supported by public funds, the language of subsection A of this section provides no such limitation.
       Had the legislature intended to limit discrimination practices to the entities outlined in subsection B, it would not have included subsection A.
       The legislature intended to assist handicapped persons to participate in all meaningful employment, not only state service, public schools, or other employment supported by public funds. Yates v. Volunteer Health Care Sys., 783 F. Supp. 1002, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2360 (W.D. Va. 1992).

        Damages for injuries related to service dogs. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an injured dog owner claimed that her dog, which was also hurt in the accident in which she was injured, was a service dog, the trial court ruled that a jury instruction that allowed the jury to award the owner damages for the emotional distress she suffered in seeing the dog hurt was an impermissible instruction. As the court explained, under § 3.1-796.127 [see now § 3.2-6585], dogs and cats were deemed to be personal property, and no damages could be awarded for any emotional distress suffered due to an injury to personal property.

        The Virginians with Disabilities Act is the exclusive state remedy for employment discrimination based on disability,
       </b>
       therefore, plaintiff, who said she was disabled by chronic fatigue syndrome, could not maintain state common law wrongful discharge claim. Mannell v. American Tobacco Co., 871 F. Supp. 854, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17248 (E.D. Va. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Virginia’s public policy against disability discrimination is manifested through the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VDA), and because the VDA contains an exclusivity provision, plaintiff’s action for disability discrimination must be pursued under the VDA and not as a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Stafford v. Radford Community Hosp., 908 F. Supp. 1369, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12050 (W.D. Va. 1995), dismissed, No. 94-1096-R, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 523 (W.D. Va. Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d 262, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 27389 (4th Cir. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In employee’s action for wrongful discharge in breach of his employment contract and in violation of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, where there was nothing in the amended complaint demonstrating the employee’s pursuit of or reasons for his failure to pursue remedies available under the Act, the court would grant the employer’s motion to dismiss. Hammonds v. Builders First Source-Atlantic Group, Inc., No. 3:01CV00023, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23839 (W.D. Va. Sept. 18, 2001).

       et seq.; therefore, the court must apply the one-year statute of limitations to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Eastman v. VPI, 732 F. Supp. 665, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3000 (W.D. Va. 1990), aff'd, 939 F.2d 204, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 14890 (4th Cir. 1991).

       </cite>
       . Because plaintiff, who alleged that the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) discriminated against him when it denied his request to use a motorized scooter on VDGIF-administered lands, did not file suit until nearly three years after the alleged act of discrimination, the suit was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in §

       Editor’s note.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In accordance with § 30-149 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the recodification of Title 63.1 of the Code of Virginia. This title, dealing with social services, was last revised in 1968. Since that time, the Department of Social Services has undergone extensive administrative and programmatic changes, including welfare reform. Revising this title provided an opportunity to delete provisions made obsolete by federal law and to update nomenclature. Also, the Departments of Blind and Vision Impaired and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing were transferred out of Title 63.1 and into Title 51.5.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Virginia Code Commission began working on this recodification in 2000. Staff utilized informal work groups made up of Department of Social Services staff and others with expertise in the field of social services to assist staff in making recommendations to the Code Commission. A draft report detailing the work of the Virginia Code Commission between June 2000 and October 2001 was circulated for public comment. The Commission completed its work on Title 63.1 and the recodification bill was introduced and passed at the 2002 Session of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, as Acts 2002, Chapter 747.

Such blindness shall be certified by a duly licensed physician or optometrist.”

       Editor’s note.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In accordance with § 30-149 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the recodification of Title 63.1 of the Code of Virginia. This title, dealing with social services, was last revised in 1968. Since that time, the Department of Social Services has undergone extensive administrative and programmatic changes, including welfare reform. Revising this title provided an opportunity to delete provisions made obsolete by federal law and to update nomenclature. Also, the Departments of Blind and Vision Impaired and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing were transferred out of Title 63.1 and into Title 51.5.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Virginia Code Commission began working on this recodification in 2000. Staff utilized informal work groups made up of Department of Social Services staff and others with expertise in the field of social services to assist staff in making recommendations to the Code Commission. A draft report detailing the work of the Virginia Code Commission between June 2000 and October 2001 was circulated for public comment. The Commission completed its work on Title 63.1 and the recodification bill was introduced and passed at the 2002 Session of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, as Acts 2002, Chapter 747.

       Coordination of local aging services and long-term care by localities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of each county or city, or a combination thereof, may designate a lead agency and member agencies to accomplish the coordination of local aging services and long-term care. If established, the agencies may establish a long-term care coordination committee composed of, but not limited to, representatives of each agency. The coordination committee may guide the coordination and administration of aging services and long-term care in the locality. The membership of the coordination committee may include, but is not limited to, representatives of the local department of public health, the local department of social services, the community services board or community mental health clinic, the area agency on aging, the local nursing home pre-admission screening team, and representatives of housing, transportation, and other appropriate local organizations that provide long-term care. A plan may be implemented that ensures the cost-effective utilization of all funds available for aging services and long-term care in the locality. Localities are encouraged to provide services and supports within each category of service in the continuum and to allow one person to deliver multiple aging services, when possible.

        County department of social services exempt from Virginia Administrative Process Act. —

      <p>
       Because a county department of social services was a unit of county government and exempt from the Virginia Administrative Process Act, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear a daughter’s appeal of its decision; at no time did a state agency make a finding against the daughter, and consequently, the statutory right to judicial review of the case decision of an administrative agency under the Act did not apply.

       Adult protective services services include investigating reports of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult and issuing any written findings; thus, any findings of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult resulting from an adult protective services investigation undertaken by a local department of social services is not a case decision of the State Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, but rather a decision by a city or county agency.
