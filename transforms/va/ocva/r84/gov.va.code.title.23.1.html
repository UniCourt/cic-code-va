Therefore, the United States Supreme Court would affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia - the Mary Baldwin Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) program - does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide equal opportunity, the United States Supreme Court would reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.

       University's residency committee did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying a student in-state tuition status and in finding she had not changed her domicile, even though she displayed many of the factors listed in the statute, including living in the state for more than a year, paying in-state income tax, and holding in-state motor vehicle, vehicle registration, and voter identification cards. Those actions could be considered auxiliary to her educational purposes in the state and did not necessitate a finding that the student had changed her domicile. Gauthier v. Va.

       Denial of the student's application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and moved to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was supposedly establishing his Virginia domicile.

       Circuit court erred in finding that a university's decision to deny a student's tuition reclassification request was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it exceeded the scope of its review by reweighing the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the university; ample evidence supported the university's conclusion that the student failed to prove her alleged Virginia domicile and reinforced the primacy of education as her reason for residing in Virginia.

Those actions could be considered auxiliary to her educational purposes in the state and did not necessitate a finding that the student had changed her domicile. Gauthier v. Va.

        In-state tuition properly denied.
       </b>
       - As a student admitted he relocated to Virginia for the primary purpose of attending law school, and many facts on which he relied to support his purported Virginia domicile could be deemed auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives or were also performed by temporary Virginia residents, he was properly denied in-state tuition under subsection B of
       <span class="s1">

       23-7.4. George Mason Univ. v. Floyd,

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the student's application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and moved to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was supposedly establishing his Virginia domicile. Va. Commonwealth Univ. v. Zhuo Cheng Su,

      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in finding that a university's decision to deny a student's tuition reclassification request was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it exceeded the scope of its review by reweighing the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the university; ample evidence supported the university's conclusion that the student failed to prove her alleged Virginia domicile and reinforced the primacy of education as her reason for residing in Virginia.

       23-7.4:3, the decision of a university's domicile appeals committee to deny a student's petition to be reclassified as an in-state student was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; the university could have reasonably concluded that a student failed to rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption contained in
       <span class="s1">

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the student lived in Virginia for more than one year, registered a car in Virginia, registered to vote in Virginia, had declared financial independence from the student's parents, had obtained a job in Virginia, and procured a bank account in Virginia, the university's denial of the student's in-state tuition application was not arbitrary or capricious where the student moved to the state only after being admitted to the university and the student reduced the student's enrollment to part-time because the student could not afford full-time attendance, a clearly education purpose. Wittich v. George Mason Univ., 75 Va. Cir. 311, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 67 (Fairfax County 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       University's decision that a student was not entitled to in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious because the decision violated both the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Domicile Guidelines and
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>

       - University's failure to provide the student an opportunity to be heard on an application for in-state tuition at an evidentiary hearing did not violate the student's due process rights because there was no requirement that the student be afforded an evidentiary hearing.

     <p>
      The New Economy Workforce Credential Grant Program is established for the purpose of (i) creating and sustaining a demand-driven supply of credentialed workers for high-demand occupations in the Commonwealth by addressing and closing the gap between the skills needed by workers in the Commonwealth and the skills of the available workforce in the Commonwealth; (ii) expanding the affordability of workforce training and credentialing; and (iii) increasing the interest of current and future Virginia workers in technician, technologist, and trade-level positions to fill the available and emerging jobs in the Commonwealth that require less than a bachelor's degree but more than a high school diploma.

      </span>
      401(k), 403(b), 408(k), 408(p), and 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The scope of the analysis shall include (i) an examination of potential retirement savings options for self-employed individuals, part-time employees, and full-time employees whose employers do not offer a retirement savings plan; (ii) the level of interest by Virginia employers in participating in a voluntary state-sponsored private retirement option; (iii) the likely costs to start up such a plan and an estimate of time to reach self-sufficiency and potential funding options; (iv) the experience of other states that have implemented or are implementing a state-sponsored private retirement solution for employers and employees; and (v) the appropriate state agency and structure to implement the solution. The analysis may include recommendations for statutory changes or amendments to the general appropriation act. The Virginia College Savings Plan, in undertaking the analysis, shall convene a group of stakeholders to assist and provide insight into the feasibility and preferred structure of such a plan. The Virginia College Savings Plan shall report its findings and recommendations to the General Assembly on or before December 15, 2020."

     <p>
      Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 556, cl. 2 provides: "That in accordance with the provisions of Item 4-3.02 of the appropriation act, the Virginia College Savings Plan (the Plan) shall receive a non-interest-bearing treasury loan in an amount not to exceed $2 million each year of each biennium to cover the costs of designing and implementing the state-facilitated IRA savings program (the Program), until such time as the Program is self-sustaining. Such loan may be renegotiated, as appropriate, and the Plan shall commence repayment with Program fees and revenues once the Program has achieved at least one year of Program cash flow positivity."
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 556, cl. 3 provides: "That the governing board of the Virginia College Savings Plan (the Board) shall convene a group of stakeholders to identify and make recommendations as to other amendments to the Code of Virginia necessary and prudent to effectuate the provisions of this act. The Board shall (i) recommend any technical amendments necessary to clarify the scope of the state-facilitated IRA savings program (the Program) and ensure compliance with law, (ii) examine the experience of other states that have enacted similar legislation, (iii) assess potential incentives to encourage participation in the Program and defray the costs of participation for small businesses, and (iv) assess the costs and benefits, to employers and to the Commonwealth, of reducing the threshold number of employees of an eligible employer under the provisions of this act. The Board shall submit its findings to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations no later than October 31, 2021."

       For purposes of this subsection, "facial recognition technology" means an electronic system for enrolling, capturing, extracting, comparing, and matching an individual's geometric facial data to identify individuals in photos, videos, or real time. "Facial recognition technology" does not include the use of an automated or semi-automated process to redact a recording in order to protect the privacy of a subject depicted in the recording prior to release or disclosure of the recording outside of the law-enforcement agency if the process does not generate or result in the retention of any biometric data or surveillance information.

        "Religious training or theological education" construed.
       </b>
       - As used in subsection (e), the phrase "theological education" is applicable to a seminary or other institution whose purpose is to prepare students for vocations associated with ordination, such as rabbi, minister or priest. By contrast, the phrase "religious training" is applicable to institutions or departments within institutions whose purpose is preparation of students for religious vocations other than those associated with ordination, which would include missionary or director of religious education. In either case, the primary function is educating students for religious vocations. Virginia College Bldg. Auth. v. Lynn,

        Teaching of secular subjects from religious viewpoint permitted.
       </b>
       - Although a university was pervasively sectarian in both policy and practice, the primary purpose of its programs, except in its divinity school, was to prepare graduate students for secular vocations; the fact that it taught various secular subjects from a religious viewpoint did not preclude the validation of bonds under this section, as the prohibition in subsection (e) relating to schools that provide religious training or theological education does not proscribe teaching of otherwise secular subjects from a religious viewpoint.

        Participation of private religious university program not contrary to establishment clause.
       </b>
       - With the exception of its school of divinity, allowing a private religious university to participate in the Virginia College Building Authority (VCBA) bond financing program did not offend the establishment clause; the issuance of VCBA bonds on behalf of the university did not result in governmental indoctrination because the VCBA determines eligibility for aid neutrally, any funds that the university would receive would be from the private choices of investors, the aid would have no impermissible content, no government funds would ever reach the university's coffers, no government funds would be used or pledged for any purpose, and this carefully constrained program could not reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.

        Immunity from suit.

       - As long as the board of visitors acts within the scope of the authority granted it by this section and its actions are not interdicted by the federal Constitution, it may well be immune from suit. However, where alleged acts by the board, if proved, would be constitutionally impermissible, the board of visitors would not be immune, but it would fall within the coverage of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.

        Due process limitation on hiring discretion.
       </b>
       - The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state university from basing its decision not to retain a professor, even probationary, on a ground wholly unsupported in fact or on a ground totally without reason. It is most important that this standard is considerably less severe than the standard of "cause" used in the dismissal of tenured faculty. To recognize this due process limitation on the hiring discretion of state universities is in no way to raise nontenured positions to tenured status. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the situation of a teacher hired from year to year at the discretion of the hiring body, due process guarantees that one must not be arbitrarily deprived of his constitutional rights. The exercise of discretion concerning a teacher's nonretention must be based on the exercise of judgment, not bias or capriciousness, and his termination certainly must not be in retaliation for the exercise of any constitutionally protected right by the teacher. Such a judgment must be based on fact and supported by reasoned analysis. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not constitutionally permissible to fail to renew the contract of a nontenured probationary professor solely on the basis of race, religion, political affiliation, or that he was exercising his otherwise protected rights of freedom of speech or association. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).

      <p>
       <b>
        A nontenured professor only has a right to a statement of reasons for his nonretention
       </b>
       in that he has a right not to be discharged for an improper reason or for no reason at all. In other words, if the college when brought into court refuses to give any reason for its action and relies solely on its discretionary authority, the professor would be entitled to summary reinstatement. On the other hand, if the college refused to give the professor any reason for its action prior to court proceedings but then gave a valid reason which could be substantiated, the professor's rights would not have been infringed. In summary, at some point the college should be compelled either to disclose its reasons or to reinstate the teacher. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board is not required to furnish written reasons to a professor for her nonretention or to allow her an opportunity to appear before the appropriate body to clear up any factual disputes concerning the nonretention. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        At the earliest possible stage.
       </b>
       - The college should be willing to give its reasons for nonretention of a professor at the earliest possible stage, but the professor does not have a constitutional right to such a disclosure during administrative proceedings. There being no absolute right to receive during the administrative process a statement of reasons for nonretention, there is accordingly no constitutional right to an administrative hearing so that the teacher can present his arguments. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).

        Burden of proof where nonretention challenged.
       </b>
       - When the college's discretion in the nonretention of a professor is challenged, the burden of proof will be upon the teacher to demonstrate constitutionally impermissible grounds for the nonretention. Holliman v. Martin, 330 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Va. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Justifiable reasons for nonretention of professor.
       </b>
       - Where the reasons for nonretention of a professor were (1) that her teaching was adequate but only adequate, (2) that she was not sufficiently involved in campus affairs, and (3) that she did not exhibit significant signs of professional growth in that she neither pursued a doctoral degree nor had any significant works published, these reasons if substantiated, would justify the professor's nonretention where the school was in the process of upgrading its faculty.

        Prohibition on concealed weapons on campus.
       </b>
       - Under current law, a university lawfully may promulgate a policy that prohibits persons from openly carrying a firearm in the buildings that are subject to the policy. However, where a university adopted a policy rather than a regulation, it has not "otherwise prohibited by law" persons with a concealed carry permit from possessing a handgun, and, therefore, the policies may not be used to prohibit persons with such a permit from carrying a concealed firearm into the buildings covered by the policy. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Emmett W. Hanger, Jr., Member, Senate of Virginia, 11-078, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 54 (7/1/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       Governing boards of colleges and universities may not impose a general prohibition on the carrying of concealed weapons by permitted individuals. Pursuant to specific grants of statutory authority, however, colleges and universities may regulate the conduct of students and employees to prohibit them from carrying concealed weapons on campus.

       Sovereign immunity.
      </b>
      - Supreme Court likely would find VCU Health System Authority to be an arm of the Commonwealth and therefore entitled to absolute immunity. Even if the Court were not to agree, however, VCU Health System Authority also satisfies the criteria of a quasi-municipal corporation and therefore would be entitled to immunity for governmental functions. The Virginia Tort Claims Act exposes the Commonwealth, but not VCU Health System Authority, to limited liability for the negligent acts of its employees. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James P. "Jimmie" Massie III, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 17-005, 2017 Va. AG LEXIS 26 (12/7/17).

       Sovereign immunity.
      </b>
      - Supreme Court likely would find VCU Health System Authority to be an arm of the Commonwealth and therefore entitled to absolute immunity. Even if the Court were not to agree, however, VCU Health System Authority also satisfies the criteria of a quasi-municipal corporation and therefore would be entitled to immunity for governmental functions. The Virginia Tort Claims Act exposes the Commonwealth, but not VCU Health System Authority, to limited liability for the negligent acts of its employees.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Authority shall purchase group life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance policies covering in whole or in part its employees. Authority employees are not required to present at their own expense evidence of insurability satisfactory to an insurance company for basic group life insurance coverage. Any employee hired prior to July 1, 1998, shall be provided basic group life insurance at the same level of coverage as provided by the Virginia Retirement System. Any employee hired on or after July 1, 1998, shall be provided basic group life insurance at a level of coverage determined by the board that is not less than the equivalent of the employee's annual salary. The Authority may require employees hired on or after July 1, 1998, to pay all or a portion of the required basic group life insurance coverage. Such payment may be collected through a payroll deduction program. The Authority may increase the insurance coverage under such policies to make available to active insured employees optional life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance. Authority employees are not covered by the Virginia Retirement System's group insurance program under § 51.1-501.

       Sovereign immunity.
      </b>
      - Supreme Court likely would find VCU Health System Authority to be an arm of the Commonwealth and therefore entitled to absolute immunity. Even if the Court were not to agree, however, VCU Health System Authority also satisfies the criteria of a quasi-municipal corporation and therefore would be entitled to immunity for governmental functions. The Virginia Tort Claims Act exposes the Commonwealth, but not VCU Health System Authority, to limited liability for the negligent acts of its employees. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James P. "Jimmie" Massie III, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 17-005, 2017 Va. AG LEXIS 26 (12/7/17).

       Sovereign immunity.
      </b>
      - Supreme Court likely would find VCU Health System Authority to be an arm of the Commonwealth and therefore entitled to absolute immunity. Even if the Court were not to agree, however, VCU Health System Authority also satisfies the criteria of a quasi-municipal corporation and therefore would be entitled to immunity for governmental functions. The Virginia Tort Claims Act exposes the Commonwealth, but not VCU Health System Authority, to limited liability for the negligent acts of its employees. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James P. "Jimmie" Massie III, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 17-005, 2017 Va. AG LEXIS 26 (12/7/17).

Therefore, the United States Supreme Court would affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia - the Mary Baldwin Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL) program - does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide equal opportunity, the United States Supreme Court would reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.

      The State Board shall require each comprehensive community college to develop policies and procedures for the award of academic credit to any student enrolled in a comprehensive community college who has successfully completed a state-approved registered apprenticeship credential in a field that is aligned with a credit-bearing program of study at the comprehensive community college in which the student is enrolled. Such policies shall ensure that academic credit is awarded only to students who have achieved the same outcomes and with the same academic rigor as in the equivalent courses offered by the institution.
