The requesting party, when practicable, shall strive to notify all other parties to the proceeding of such request.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any legislative bill requiring a net additional expenditure by any county, city, or town, or whenever any legislative bill requiring a net reduction of revenues by any county, city, or town, is filed during any session of the General Assembly, the Commission on Local Government shall investigate and prepare an estimate setting forth, to the extent practicable, the additional expenditures or reduction of revenues, if any, to be required of the affected localities in event of enactment of such legislation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A bill shall be deemed to require an expenditure if it has the effect of requiring any county, city, or town to (i) perform or administer a new or expanded program or service, (ii) maintain an existing program or service at a specified level of spending or delivery, (iii) assume or incur administrative costs in support of a state or state-related program, or (iv) furnish capital facilities for state or state-related activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, "net additional expenditure" means the cost anticipated to be incurred annually, less any revenues receivable on account of the program or service from fees charged recipients of the program or service, state or federal aid paid specifically and categorically in connection with the program or service, new or increased local sources of revenue authorized and designated specifically to offset the cost of the program or service, and any offsetting savings resulting from the reduction or elimination of any program or service directly attributable to the performance of the required program or service.
     </p>
     <p>
      A bill shall be deemed to require a net reduction of revenues if it has the effect of requiring any county, city, or town to (i) relinquish an existing or potential source of local revenue by classification or exclusion or (ii) diminish an existing or potential source of revenue by classification or exclusion.
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth that each legislative study group, including the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council and its subcommittees, the Virginia Code Commission, special legislative study commissions, and standing committees of the House and Senate and their subcommittees, either through its members or staff, advise the agency head of the general nature of a study or investigation being conducted by such group whenever it determines that information within such agency is applicable to such study or investigation. Thereafter, such legislative study group may seek out all information within such agency from an individual designated by the agency head to provide pertinent information or from the most direct and primary source without further communication or contact with the agency head. Each employee within such agency shall give his full cooperation to the group and its staff in collecting the information. No member or staff member of such groups shall be entitled to access to information, without permission of the agency head, for which disclosure is prohibited by specific provisions of law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Insofar as possible, the legislative study groups and their staffs shall perform their collection duties, and utilize the services of personnel within the agencies in doing so, in such a manner as to minimize disruption of the normal operations of the agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such freedom to access of all information within all state agencies is deemed absolutely necessary for the legislature to be able to efficiently evaluate laws and policies of the Commonwealth, how they are being administered, and the need for changes in such laws and policies, and also for the Virginia General Assembly to effectively fulfill its responsibility regarding legislative oversight.

     <p>
      <b>
       Members of the Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission who also are legislators
      </b>
      are subject to all applicable provisions of the General Assembly Conflicts Act in their service on the Commission. However, the only transactions for which this Act requires disqualification are transactions with the General Assembly. Thus, the General Assembly Conflicts Act will not come into play for transactions of the Commission, and it will not require any legislator to disqualify himself from transactions of the Commission. A legislator does remain subject to State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act in his capacity as a member of the Commission, and if Act requires him to disqualify himself from a transaction, the savings clause would apply. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Frank W. Wagner, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-076, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (2/6/15).

Such action shall, after notice to the Auditor of Public Accounts and an opportunity to be heard, require a three-fifths vote of all Commission members and shall be effective until the House of Delegates, acting at the next regular or special session of the General Assembly, determines whether to institute impeachment proceedings against the Auditor, as provided in Article IV, Section 17 of the Constitution of Virginia or until the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, by a majority vote of its membership, determines that the Auditor of Public Accounts can resume the performance of his duties. Upon institution of impeachment proceedings by the House of Delegates, the Commission may continue to perform such duties until the conclusion of impeachment proceedings.

       § 30-152. Revision of the Code of Virginia; construction of statutes relating to titles amended.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Code of Virginia shall continue to be gradually revised by revising one title at a time. The Commission shall have the responsibility for drafting title revision and recodification bills for introduction into the General Assembly. During the recodification or title revision process, the Commission shall evaluate the need for and recommend the repeal of any section or provision relating to the revised title that has not been implemented during any of the previous five years because sufficient funds were not appropriated by the General Assembly. The House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations shall assist the Commission in determining which sections and provisions of the Code of Virginia meet these conditions for repeal. In the revision of each title, all other sections of the Code of Virginia relating to the same subject matter shall be revised to the extent necessary. Whenever in a title revision or recodification bill an existing section of a title of the Code of Virginia is repealed and replaced with a renumbered section and that section so repealed was effective with an uncodified enactment, the repeal of that section, alone, shall not affect the uncodified enactment. The title revision or recodification bill shall expressly repeal the uncodified enactment in order for the enactment to be repealed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever, during any session of the General Assembly, there shall have been enacted any statute purporting to revise, rearrange, amend, and recodify any title of the Code of Virginia, such statute shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other statute enacted at such session adding to, repealing, or amending and reenacting any portion of such title. Every such other statute shall be deemed to have so added to, repealed, or amended and reenacted, as the case may be, such title as so revised, rearranged, amended, and recodified. Effect shall be given to any such other, or subsequent, statute only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to such session.

      The Joint Commission on Health Care (the Commission) is established in the legislative branch of state government. The purpose of the Commission is to study, report and make recommendations on all areas of health care provision, regulation, insurance, liability, licensing, and delivery of services. In so doing, the Commission shall endeavor to ensure that the Commonwealth as provider, financier, and regulator adopts the most cost-effective and efficacious means of delivery of health care services so that the greatest number of Virginians receive quality health care. Further, the Commission shall encourage the development of uniform policies and services to ensure the availability of quality, affordable and accessible health services and provide a forum for continuing the review and study of programs and services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission may make recommendations and coordinate the proposals and recommendations of all commissions and agencies as to legislation affecting the provision and delivery of health care.

     <p>
      The Commission on Civic Education (the Commission) is established in the legislative branch of state government. The purposes of the Commission are to (i) educate students on the importance of citizen involvement in a constitutional republic, (ii) promote the study of state and local government among the Commonwealth's citizenry, and (iii) enhance communication and collaboration among organizations in the Commonwealth that conduct civic education.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission shall have a total membership of 17 members that shall consist of five legislative members and 12 nonlegislative citizen members. Members shall be appointed as follows: three members of the House of Delegates, to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Delegates in accordance with the principles of proportional representation contained in the Rules of the House of Delegates; two members of the Senate, to be appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules; six nonlegislative citizen members, two of whom shall be former or current government or civics teachers, one of whom shall be a representative of an organization involved in civic engagement, one of whom shall be a representative of an institution of political or civil engagement studies center, one of whom shall be a Department of Education social studies specialist, and one of whom shall have the qualifications or experience as determined by the Speaker, to be appointed by the Speaker of the House of Delegates; and six nonlegislative citizen members, two of whom shall be current or former social studies coordinators, one of whom shall be a representative of a voter outreach organization, one of whom shall be a member of the Virginia Press Association, one of whom shall be a professor of social studies education, and one of whom shall have the qualifications or experience as determined by the Senate Committee on Rules, to be appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules. Nonlegislative citizen members of the Commission shall be citizens of the Commonwealth. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the chairman of the Commission, the Clerk of the House of Delegates, and the Clerk of the Senate, nonlegislative citizen members shall only be reimbursed for travel originating and ending within the Commonwealth for the purpose of attending meetings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legislative members shall serve terms coincident with their terms of office. Nonlegislative citizen members shall be appointed for a term of two years. Appointments to fill vacancies, other than by expiration of a term, shall be for the unexpired terms. Legislative members and nonlegislative citizen members may be reappointed. However, no nonlegislative citizen member shall serve more than four consecutive two-year terms. The remainder of any term to which a member is appointed to fill a vacancy shall not constitute a term in determining the member's eligibility for reappointment. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commission shall elect a chairman and vice-chairman from among its membership, who shall be members of the General Assembly.
