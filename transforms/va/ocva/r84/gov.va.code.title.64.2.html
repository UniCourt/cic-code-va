      As used in this title, unless the context otherwise requires:
     </p>
     <p>
      "Bona fide purchaser"
      means a purchaser of property for value who has acted in the transaction in good faith. Notice of a seller's marital status, or notice of the existence of a premarital or marital agreement, does not affect the status of a bona fide purchaser. A "purchaser" is one who acquires property by sale, lease, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, or lien or who otherwise deals with property in a voluntary transaction, other than a gift. A purchaser gives "value" for property acquired in return for a binding commitment to extend credit to the transferor or another as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim, or in return for any other consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Fiduciary"
      includes a guardian, committee, trustee, executor, conservator, or personal representative.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Personal representative"
      includes the executor under a will or the administrator of the estate of a decedent, the administrator of such estate with the will annexed, the administrator of such estate unadministered by a former representative, whether there is a will or not, any person who is under the order of a circuit court to take into his possession the estate of a decedent for administration, and every other curator of a decedent's estate, for or against whom suits may be brought for causes of action that accrued to or against the decedent.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Trustee"
      means a trustee under a probated will or an inter vivos trust instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Will"
    includes any testament, codicil, exercise of a power of appointment by will or by a writing in the nature of a will, or any other testamentary disposition.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the interpretation of wills and trusts, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gift terminology or terms of relationship in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession unless a contrary intent appears on the face of the will or trust. In determining the intent of a testator or settlor, adopted persons are presumptively included in such terms as "children," "issue," "kindred," "heirs," "relatives," "descendents" or similar words of classification and are presumptively excluded by such terms as "natural children," "issue of the body," "blood kindred," "heirs of the body," "blood relatives," "descendents of the body" or similar words of classification. In the event that a fiduciary makes payment to members of a class to the exclusion of persons born out of wedlock of whose claim of paternity or maternity the fiduciary has no knowledge, the fiduciary shall not be held liable to such persons for payments made prior to knowledge of such claim. This section shall apply to all inter vivos trusts executed after July 1, 1978, and to all wills of decedents dying after July 1, 1978, regardless of when executed.

         Adopted child is on same footing as natural child.
        </b>
        - The words "from and through" as used in this section have a plain, simple and unmistakable meaning, with two significations, which cannot be ignored. The united words imply, in connection with inheritance, not only the obvious meaning that an adopted child shall inherit from the adopting parents, but that the adopting parents shall be the medium through which he may inherit from their relatives. Considered in connection with the broad and comprehensive language employed, they emphasize the specific intention to put an adopted child on the same footing as the natural child, thus giving him the right to take by representation what his adopting parent would have taken had he been alive, or what the natural child would have taken, had there been one, upon the death of his father intestate.

        It would be unreasonable to say that a testatrix had in mind at the time of the execution of her will and at the time of her death that by the use of the word "heirs" she intended to include an adult adopted long after her death. Since there was nothing in the will to show such intention it was presumed that the testatrix intended that her property would go according to the law of natural descent, and not according to the relationship created by law.

The one-year limitation period in subdivision 3 of this section did not begin to run until the wife's death since the child's right to claim her inheritance in the wife's estate through her putative father did not accrue until the wife's death. The trial court erred in ruling that the statute began to run on its effective date (July 1, 1978) and in ruling that the child's claim was therefore time-barred, since this would have been a statutory taking of her property without due process in violation of both the federal and Virginia Constitutions.

       - A conveyance by a husband, by which he parts absolutely with an interest in personal property, though it is not to take effect until his death, and though he retains the power to sell and reinvest or account, and also the power to reappoint among specified objects, is valid to bar the wife of her distributable share therein.

         Definition.

        - In its strictest technical sense an advancement is a perfect and irrevocable gift, not required by law, made by a parent during his lifetime to his child, with the intention on the part of the donor that such gift shall represent a part or the whole of the portion of the donor's estate that the donee would be entitled to on the death of the donor intestate.

         Two elements are essential

        to constitute an advancement, a gift by the parent to the child and the intention by the donor that the gift shall be an advancement. But the latter may be inferred from the former.

         The intention of the testator determines the question as to whether or not the gift is an advancement.

        If, from all the circumstances surrounding a particular case, it can be said that a parent intended a transfer of property to a child to represent a portion of the child's supposed share in the parent's estate, such transfer will be treated in law as an advancement. The converse is, as a matter of course, true; hence, where it appears that the ancestor intended that a gift to his child should not be treated as an advancement, such intention will be respected and enforced.

         Partial intestacy only necessary.

        - Under the Virginia statute the doctrine of hotchpot has been greatly enlarged. At the common law, it only applied when the decedent died wholly intestate, while under this section it is only necessary that there be a partial intestacy. Payne v. Payne,

       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not assume to interfere with the freedom of the ancestor to prefer one or more of his descendants in the distribution of his estate, but applies only where, having distributed a part of his estate to them, he has left part of it undisposed of, to be distributed under the statute of descents and distributions.

        A child having received advancements, and refusing to share in the first division, but claiming to share in the division of the dower, is to be charged with interest on his advancements or their value, from the death of the intestate to the date of the division. And if the principal and interest of his advancements exceeds the amount received by the other children, he is then to be charged with interest on such excess from that time to the period of the second division. But having elected not to come in on the first division, if his advancements with interest thereon were not equal to the shares of the other children on that division, he is not entitled to have the deficiency made up on the second division.

       - This section plainly expresses the intent that rights be subordinate to payment of estate debts. The debtor's interest, regardless of when it vests, is in the value of the augmented estate. Murray v. Mares, 147 Bankr. 688 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1992).

       - Trial court did not err in finding that the late wife's separate property, as identified in the premarital agreement she entered into with the husband, was not to be included in his elective share upon her death, as the plain language of the premarital agreement compelled that result; the husband's claim that the property had to be maintained or repaired in order to keep it separate had to be rejected, as the language of this section referred to keeping a legal interest in the property separate, which the late wife did.

It was to give the inchoate and contingent dower of the wife the power to attach to the equity of redemption, during his lifetime, so that after a sale in her husband's lifetime, it would survive and be enforceable against his equity of redemption in the lands after his death, just as if the sale had been made after his death.

        64.1-28 left it in doubt whether the wife, in taking her dower "in the surplus," was to take out of the surplus only one third of the surplus or was to take one third of the value of the whole tract subjected to the lien. But it is now settled in Virginia that the dower is to consist of one third of the surplus only, not only under the statute where the land is sold under the lien in the husband's lifetime, but also independently of statute where the land is sold under the lien after the husband's death.

        64.1-33 was a substitute for what is known at common law as the widow's quarantine - a right to hold and occupy the capital message or mansion house for 40 days after the husband's death, and during that time to be provided with all necessaries at the expense of the heir, and, before the termination of 40 days, to have her dower assigned her. If, however, the 40 days expired without her dower being assigned, she might be turned out of possession, and put to her action for the recovery of her dower. Simmons v. Lyles, 73 Va.

        64.1-33 was merely to extend the quarantine. The object manifestly was to coerce the heir to assign dower, and until this was done, to protect the widow in the enjoyment of the homestead and the rents and profits accruing therefrom. The widow has no vested estate in the mansion house, "but a mere right to hold and occupy until dower is assigned her. It is but a permissive possession, determinable whenever the heir or person holding the fee elects to assign dower." Simmons v. Lyles, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 752 (1880).

        Effect of agreement in bar of dower.
       </b>
       - By an agreement in contemplation of marriage, the intended husband bound his estate to pay to his intended wife certain sums of money if she survived him, which were to be in bar of and in full compensation for her dower. This agreement, although a bar to her claiming dower in her husband's real estate, does not deprive her of her distributive share of his personal estate. Findley's Ex'rs v. Findley, 52 Va.

       <b>
        Defeating distributive share during lifetime.
       </b>
       - The husband had the power according to the modern common law to alienate by sale or gift in his lifetime the whole or any part of his personal estate and thereby exclude his wife from any interest therein. This power is impliedly recognized by the statutes. Gentry v. Bailey, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 594 (1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a husband cannot by will defeat his wife's claim to her distributive share in his personal estate, he may do so by an irrevocable disposition of his property in his lifetime, although he secures a life estate to himself and his purpose is to defeat the claim of his wife as one of his distributees. An irrevocable deed of trust is not to be considered a will in disguise merely because it disposes of nearly all of grantor's personal estate and reserves to the grantor the possession and control of the property during his life.

        Deed of settlement and necessity of renouncing will.
       </b>
       - A husband made a deed of settlement of property upon his wife, and then by will made a disposition of the property, different from that made by the deed of settlement, and far less beneficial to the wife, and died. The wife took administration with the will annexed. The widow may claim under the deed of settlement, without having renounced the provision made for her by the will according to the statute.

        Manner of renouncing.

       - A widow cannot effectually renounce the provision made for her by the will of her husband, so as to entitle herself as distributee, but by declaration made within one year after the husband's death, before the general court, or court having jurisdiction of the probate of the will, or by deed executed in the presence of two or more credible witnesses (now, under

        Effect of acceptance.
       </b>
       - The testator by his will, gave real and personal estate to his wife, and left part of his personal estate undisposed of. The wife did not renounce, but accepted, the provision made for her by the will. She was excluded, by the statute, from any share of her husband's personal estate undisposed of by his will. Dupree's Adm'r v. Cary, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 36 (1835); Thornton v. Winston, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 152 (1833).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the widow fails to renounce within a year, and thus by her inaction elects to abide by the will and accept the provisions, if any, made for her therein, she is not a mere donee under the instrument. She is considered a purchaser for value of the property willed to her for she has, by taking under the will, given up and released the absolute and paramount right secured her by statute which she could obtain by renunciation.

       </span>
       64.1-13, the surviving spouse must have the capacity to understand his right to elect against the will and receive a share of the estate established by law and to know that he is making such an election; competency to execute the notice of claim does not require a surviving spouse to know the specific amount that will be received as a result of such an election, and whether he exercises good judgment when making an election is not relevant to the issue of mental capacity to make such a choice.

       Trial court erred by applying the contract and deed standard of mental capacity to a father's execution of a claim for an elective share of his deceased wife's augmented estate; under the correct standard - that he had the capacity to understand his right to elect against the will and receive a share of the estate established by law and to know that he was making such an election - an executor failed to prove the father was not competent, as his doctors did not indicate he lacked the mental capacity to execute the notice of claim, and lay testimony indicated that he was alert and had read the claim before signing it.

       - Although the trial court denied the motion to reconsider most parts of its ruling that identified the owners of property due to the death of the decedent, that set the amount of the augmented estate, that determined the amount of the surviving spouse's elective share, and that calculated the amount of the respective contributions from those responsible for satisfying the elective share, it granted that motion regarding its failure to evaluate the evidence of additional charges and expenses, and because it did not address the impact that such evidence had on the fair market value of the fractional interests in the property designated on the statements setting forth the required contributions.

        Suit to construe will of doubtful import.
       </b>
       - A widow brought suit against the executor of the estate of her deceased husband, and the beneficiaries named in his will, praying that the court construe an antenuptial contract made between her and testator, and certain parts of the will, and to declare: (1) whether the antenuptial contract was valid and binding on her; (2) whether the will cancelled or terminated the antenuptial contract; (3) whether $15,000 found in testator's safe deposit box was an asset of testator's estate or the property of two of the respondents; (4) whether she was under any obligation to assume in whole or in part the cost of maintaining the house formerly occupied by her and her husband. The suit was one to construe a will of doubtful import, and therefore the court had jurisdiction to extend the time within which she could accept or renounce the will. Batleman v. Rubin,

A corporate fiduciary shall not be considered to have notice until it receives notice at its address as shown in the decedent's estate papers in the clerk's office or, if there are no such papers or no address is shown therein, at the office of its registered agent.

        No other party is subject to contribution to make up the elective share even though the party makes a payment or transfers an item of property or other benefit to any person with actual knowledge that a surviving spouse has claimed an elective share in the decedent's estate.

        Definition of "abandonment."
       </b>
       - Mindful of the definition of the term "abandonment" in domestic relations cases, when resolving whether a spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse abandoned the deceased spouse, the word "abandonment" means a termination of the normal indicia of a marital relationship combined with an intent to abandon the marital relationship. Purce v. Patterson,

      <p>
       <b>
        Willful abandonment.
       </b>
       - Spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse was not entitled to such relief because the spouse willfully abandoned the decedent before and continuing until the decedent's death, as, properly considering facts occurring both before and after the spouse and decedent voluntarily separated, the spouse's conduct showed a lack of support for the decedent and the marital relationship, because: (1) while living together or apart, the spouse gave the decedent little or no support or care during the decedent's illnesses and recoveries; (2) financially, the decedent managed rental properties the decedent brought into the marriage alone while living with the spouse, who did not contribute to the decedent's support in this regard; (3) after the parties' separation, the spouse apparently did not communicate with the decedent in any meaningful way since the spouse did not know the decedent lived in another state and did not acknowledge the decedent's final illness; (4) the spouse did not support the decedent financially, emotionally, or physically; (5) nothing showed the spouse tried or intended to reconcile with the decedent; and (6) when the decedent died, the spouse had ceased any marital duties.

       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       64.1-16.3 extends to the time of the deceased spouse's death and is not limited to the moment of separation, or the filing of a petition for divorce, as it is when abandonment is the ground upon which a divorce is sought. Purce v. Patterson,

       64.1-16.3 requires a court to determine whether a spouse's willful desertion or abandonment of a deceased spouse of whose estate the living spouse claims a share continued until the death of the spouse, and that determination is not limited to consideration of actions occurring prior to a separation, should one have occurred.

        Agreed separation or petition for divorce.
       </b>
       - When determining whether a spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse willfully abandoned the deceased spouse, an agreed separation or petition for divorce is relevant evidence of the termination of cohabitation, but is not evidence that defeats a finding of willful abandonment. Purce v. Patterson,

        Mixed question of fact and law.
       </b>
       - Whether a spouse seeking an elective share of a deceased spouse's augmented estate abandoned the deceased spouse is a mixed question of law and fact, so a reviewing court gives deference to a trial court's findings of fact and views the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, but the reviewing court reviews the trial court's application of the law to those facts de novo.

       If a will refers to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically bequeathed, the statement or list shall be given effect to the extent that it describes items of tangible personal property and their intended recipients with reasonable certainty and is signed by the testator although it does not satisfy the requirements for a will. Bequests of a general or residuary nature, whether referring only to personal property or to the entire estate, are not specific bequests for the purpose of this section.

When distribution is made pursuant to such a written statement or list, a copy thereof shall be furnished to the commissioner of accounts along with the legatee's receipt.

However, a person named to receive certain tangible personal property in a written statement or list that is effective under this section may recover that property, or its value if the property cannot be recovered, from an apparent legatee to whom it has been distributed in an action brought for that purpose within one year after the probate of the testator's will.

        Burden of proof requirements.

       - In a case in which contestant challenged the authenticity of a will alleging testamentary capacity, the proponent of the will was entitled to a presumption that testamentary capacity existed by proving compliance with all statutory requirements for the valid execution of the will.

       - Instruction, which directed jury to find that the will in question was not the last will of the testatrix if the contestants proved by clear and convincing evidence that the testatrix did not possess the requisite testamentary capacity at the time the will was made, improperly placed the burden of proof on contestants to prove the testatrix's incapacity by clear and convincing evidence.

        Purpose.
       </b>
       - The purpose of the statutory requirements with respect to the execution of wills was to throw every safeguard deemed necessary around a testator while in the performance of this important act, and to prevent the probate of a fraudulent and suppositious will instead of the real one. To accomplish this, the statute must be strictly followed. It is, however, quite as important that these statutory requirements should not be supplemented by the courts with others that might tend to increase the difficulty of the transaction to such an extent as practically to destroy the right of the uninformed layman to dispose of his property by will. Savage v. Bowen,

       The ceremonies required were not intended to restrain or abridge the power of testators, but to guard and protect them in the exercise of that power. Moon v. Norvell,

       The purpose of this section is to prevent mistakes, imposition, fraud or deception. Moon v. Norvell,

      <p>
       The purpose of the statute in requiring subscription of a will by competent witnesses in the presence of the testator is to prevent fraud, deception, mistake, and the substitution of a surreptitious document; however, these requirements are not intended to restrain or abridge the power of a testator to dispose of his property.
       They are intended to guard and protect him in the exercise of that power. Robinson v. Ward,
       <cite class="va_code">

       The purpose of this statute is to prevent fraud, mistake, or the substitution of documents; it is not intended to place restraints on the power to execute a will but to guard and protect that power. Draper v. Pauley, 480 S.E.2d 495 (1997).

        Section must be complied with.
       </b>
       - The protective requirements of this section, designed to insure testamentary disposition of property against fraud and impositions, must be of general application, and must be proven to have been complied with. Triplett v. Triplett,

       The provisions of this section must be complied with in order that a will may be valid. Moyers v. Gregory,

       , 7 S.E.2d 881 (1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section must be strictly followed, it is vital that the provisions not be construed in a manner which would "increase the difficulty of the transaction to such an extent as to practically destroy" the right of the uninformed lay person to dispose of property by will; the statute should be given "a sound and fair construction" with rigid insistence "upon substantial compliance with its requirements."

        Although the testator had signed will before the document contained the disposition of her property, there was no dispute that the signature was hers, and that following the transcription of the statement and its recitation back to her, testator stated that the document was exactly what she wanted. Under these circumstances, the signature was "intended as a signature" and the "will acknowledged" by the testator in the presence of two competent witnesses in satisfaction of the requirements for a valid will contained in this section.

         Testamentary intent must appear from face of paper.
        </b>
        - It is elementary that to constitute a valid will a paper offered for probate must have been designed or intended to operate as a disposition of the testator's property to take effect after his death. In this jurisdiction such testamentary intent must appear from the face of the paper itself. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings,

         Testamentary capacity.

        - Trial court erred in ruling that a testator lacked testamentary capacity when executing a contested will as the evidence did not support such a finding. The trial court erred in placing more weight on the testimony of the testator's doctor and her children who were not present when she executed the will than it did on the testimony of the witnesses, the notary, and the will proponent who were present when the will was executed; there was no testimony that the testator was not lucid at the time that she executed the contested will.

        There is nothing that requires less formality than the body of a will or testament. If it is duly signed, attested and published, it may assume almost any form, provided it was intended by the party to take effect after his death. The form of a paper does not affect its title to probate, provided it be the intention of the deceased that it should operate after his death. The true question is whether the deceased has done a testamentary act; and that involves not merely the terms, but also the perfect and appropriate execution, of the instrument; and the latter is the proper subject of parol evidence.

Such purpose must be executed in the only manner authorized by this section; that is, the writing itself must be authenticated by the signature of the decedent. It is not sufficient to raise a doubt as to whether his name is intended to authenticate the paper which is propounded as a will, for, to use the explicit language of this section, it must be signed "in such manner as to make it manifest that the name is intended as his signature," and unless so signed it is not valid.

        The will of a testatrix was written on six sheets of paper and each one of the sheets of paper upon which the will appeared, except the last, had already been signed by the testatrix, when the attesting witnesses were called upon to witness the execution of the will, and the testatrix in the presence of the witnesses affixed her signature to the margin of the last sheet nearly opposite the end of the will and above the concluding clause.

        - An attestation of a will of lands made in the same room with testator is prima facie an attestation in his presence, according to the statute of wills; attestation not made in the same room is prima facie not an attestation in his presence. But as, in the one case, the attestation is good, if shown to have been made within the scope of testator's view from his actual position, so in the other, it is not good, if it appear, that in the actual relative situation of testator and witnesses, he could not possibly have seen the act of attestation, nor have so changed situation as to have enabled him to see it, without aid from others, which was at hand, but was neither asked nor given.

        The subscription of the witnesses is substantially the attestation contemplated by this section, and it is sufficient if the purpose be indicated by the briefest memorandum or merely by a fair presumption arising from the local position of their signatures upon the paper.

         Validity of will does not depend on attestation clause.

        - An attesting witness is one who signs his name to an instrument for the purpose of proving and identifying it, or one who signs with the intention of being considered a witness to an act in question. The validity of a will depends not on the attestation clause but on the conformity of the execution to the requirement of this section. Ferguson v. Ferguson,

        In a suit to contest a will, it was contended that the will had not been executed in the manner prescribed in this section. The basis of the contention was the admission of one of the attesting witnesses, prior to the trial, that he did not recall the circumstances as to the presence of the parties when the will was signed and witnessed. However, at the trial the same witness testified that after having discussed the matter with the executor, who was likewise present, he was positive that the will had been signed and witnessed when all of the necessary parties were present together. This testimony was fully corroborated by that of the other attesting witness and the executor. It was held that there was no merit in the contention. Mullins v. Coleman,

         Alterations made by testator do not invalidate will.

        - Erasures and other alterations made by the testator in a holographic will, even though they are made after the will has been executed, do not invalidate it if his name still remains in such manner as to manifest that it was intended as a signature. The will becomes reexecuted with all the changes as valid and subsisting parts of the new will. Triplett v. Triplett,

        Will offered for probate contained the same three pages as those present at the time of execution because (1) it was not statutorily required that the pages be stapled or that the testator initial each page, (2) credible testimony of the testator's friend showed the will reflected the testator's desires expressed shortly before he died, so the document submitted did not suffer from the substitution of any pages, and (3) the lack of a staple where one had been did not defeat the testator's testamentary plan, as nothing showed pages were substituted.

         Cancellation requires physical defacement or mutilation.
        </b>
        - The revocation of a will by cancellation, within the meaning of this section, contemplates marks or lines across the written parts of the instrument, or a physical defacement, or some mutilation of the writing itself, with the intent to revoke. If written words are used for the purpose, they must be so placed as to physically affect the written portion of the will, not merely on blank parts of the paper on which the will is written. If the writing intended to be the act of cancelling does not mutilate, or erase, or deface, or otherwise physically come in contact with any part of a written word of the will, it cannot be given any greater weight than a similar writing on a separate sheet of paper, which identifies the will referred to just as definitely as does the writing on the back. If a will may be revoked by writing on the back, separable from the will, it may be done by a writing not on the will, and this the statute forbids. Thompson v. Royall,

        - To effect revocation of a duly executed will, in any of the methods prescribed by this section, two things are necessary: (1) the doing of one of the acts specified, (2) accompanied by the intent to revoke - the animus revocandi.

        - Contestants brought suit to set aside a paper writing which had been admitted to probate ex parte, as the last will of decedent, on the ground that it had been found among decedent's effects in her possession in a canceled and mutilated condition. The proponents submitted evidence that deceased a year before her death while sick in a hospital requested her attorney to secure and care for certain papers then located in her home. He found among the papers the purported will, dated about seventeen years before, written and signed wholly in deceased's handwriting in ink, but which had pencil lines extending through each and every line, including the signature. From those facts it was presumed that the pencil marks were made by decedent with the intention of revoking the instrument in a manner required by this section. Since appellants offered no evidence to rebut that presumption, it prevailed. Franklin v. McLean,

         Evidence supported cancellation.
        </b>
        - The physical act of drawing lines through the typed provisions of will article unambiguously supported an inference of cancellation. Furthermore, there was the unrebutted presumption that the testator made these changes with the intent to revoke. When, as here, the will presented for probate had been in the testator's custody after execution and was found among his effects at death with provisions marked through that constitute a sufficient act of cancellation within the meaning of the applicable statute, a rebuttable presumption arises that such marks were made with the intention of revoking the affected provisions. In addition, even though the marginal notes were of no legal effect, they did support the conclusion drawn from an examination of the document left by the testator that he meant a partial, not complete, revocation of the will.

        - In a suit to declare a purported holographic will null and void because of a "legend of revocation" which appeared in a blank space between the date of the will and the attestation clause and above the testator's signature, two attesting witnesses testified that the "legend of revocation" was not on the will at the time they signed it. The entire will, including the "legend of revocation," with the exception of the signature of the two attesting witnesses, was in the handwriting of the testator. It was held that for the revocation to be valid, it was not necessary that the will be signed again if the name of the testator remained in such manner that it was manifestly intended by him as and for his signature to the revocation.

         Doctrine of dependent relative revocation.
        </b>
        - Under the doctrine of dependent relative revocation, if a testator cancels or destroys a will, or does any other act to vitiate it, with the present intention of making a new one immediately, and the new will is not made, or if made fails of effect because not properly executed, or for any other reason, then the old will, having been conditionally revoked, still stands, on the theory that if the testator is not able to carry out his whole testamentary intent in making the new will, or in making changes in the old one, then it is to be presumed that he prefers his old will to intestacy; that the revocation was conditioned upon the new testamentary disposition being effective.

        </b>
        - Where a will which revokes a former will has been lost or destroyed and its contents cannot be sufficiently proved to admit it to probate, it may nevertheless be availed of as a revocation in opposition to the probate of the will which it revokes. Hugo v. Clark,

        </b>
        - Where it is proved that a will was executed but afterwards lost or destroyed by the testator, or some other person, without an intention to revoke it, it will not, in the absence of proof, be presumed that it contained an express clause of revocation. In such case, an existing prior will is only revoked by the subsequent lost will to the extent that the provisions of the lost will are irreconcilably inconsistent. It is not necessary for the contents of the lost will to be proved, if enough be proved to show that it revoked the former will. Hylton v. Hylton, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 161 (1844).

         Alterations and deletions by another to clarify will; alleged later will not revoking.
        </b>
        - Testatrix drew up a valid holographic will without assistance, but later sought the aid of a friend in correcting its literary form. The friend testified that in the presence of testatrix and with her consent, she undertook to make certain alterations and deletions on the paper for the sole purpose of clarifying the document as to punctuation, grammar and phraseology, and that testatrix, insistent that she make her own will and not have it made for her, took the paper away with the intention of making a copy which would be wholly in her handwriting. The witness further related that testatrix had subsequently shown her a later will beginning with a clause of revocation, but this testimony was not convincing and a thorough search did not disclose any other testamentary paper of any kind. It was contended that the will was invalid, because not wholly in testatrix's handwriting, but that if it were valid, it had been revoked. There was no merit in either contention. It was clear that the changes in the will were made for one of two purposes, either to polish and clarify and make it intelligible, without changing its meaning, or as a basis to be used by testatrix in making a new will. If the first was the case, the will was not annulled for so unimportant a cause, and in the second event, it was preserved under the doctrine of dependent relative revocation. Bell v. Timmins,

         Effect of revocation of subsequent inconsistent will.

        - If a subsequent inconsistent will has been destroyed by the maker animo revocandi, then no conflict arises or can arise between it and a prior will, for wills are ambulatory and operate only upon and by reason of death. Thus wills which did not expressly revoke prior wills, and which were destroyed animo revocandi, never constituted wills under this section, and never revoked the earlier wills. Poindexter v. Jones,

        - The language of the letter, while showing testator's desire that his daughters share equally in his estate, did not contain any evidence that he intended that letter to operate as his last will or as a codicil to his will. Rather, the evidence showed that testator characterized his will as "out of date" but believed that it would be effective. Under these facts, the court could not conclude that the April 1992 letter demonstrated the testamentary intent to revoke portions of the 1982 will and to substitute a different disposition of the testator's property.

      <p>
       Where the language of testatrix's will showed her intention to give to the legatees of certain corporate stock the proportionate interest she had in the corporations at the time of the execution of her will, thereby making the legacies specific, this showed testatrix's intent to have her will speak as of the date of its execution, which made inapplicable the statutory rule of construction that a will ordinarily speaks as of the date of death.

       - At common law, a general residue of personal property comprehends everything not otherwise effectually disposed of by the will, and since the revisal of 1849 we have had a statute in Virginia which puts devises of real estate on the same footing in this particular with legacies of personalty.

       - Entirety of decedent's estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedent's will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not required, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust Mirman v.

        This section made a sweeping change from the common-law
       </b>
       doctrine of lapsed or void legacies, declaring what the law should be in the future in no uncertain language, and our courts cannot make exceptions and uphold distinctions where the plain letter of the law recognizes none. Wildberger v. Cheek,

       The general doctrine, at common law, is that a devise lapses in all cases where the devisee dies before the testator. And if the devise be to several, as tenants in common, and one of them dies in the testator's lifetime, his share lapses. In Virginia the only modification of the doctrine is found in this section.

The only conditions it imposes are: The devisee or legatee must have died before the testator, leaving issue who survive the testator. It does not impose the condition that the devisee or legatee shall be "in esse" at the date of the will, but the policy of the law is plainly disclosed, viz.: to uphold and give effect to a devise or legacy rather than to allow it to fail for the want of a person "in esse" to take it.

       - It was contended that although the donee of a power was restricted in her selection to the nieces and nephews of her husband, yet this section enabled her to do indirectly what she could not do directly, i.e., select from the class deceased members to be the beneficiaries, and by the provisions of

       The personal representative, trustee, other fiduciary, or any affected beneficiary under the will, trust, or other instrument may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust, or other instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection A. A proceeding under this section shall be commenced prior to January 1, 2012. In such a proceeding, the court may consider extrinsic evidence that contradicts the plain meaning of the will, trust, or other instrument. The court shall have the power to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument that refers to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax laws as described in subsection A to (i) conform the terms to the decedent's intention or (ii) achieve the decedent's tax objectives in a manner that is not contrary to the decedent's probable intention. The court may provide that its decision, including any decision to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument, shall be effective as of the date of the decedent's death. A person who commences a proceeding under this section has the burdens of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, and persuasion in establishing the decedent's intention that the will, trust, or other instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection A.

The Secretary of the Commonwealth, at the request of the authorized person, may cause the information he receives about execution of any international will to be transmitted to the registry system of another jurisdiction as identified by the testator, if that other system adheres to rules protecting the confidentiality of the information similar to those established in the Commonwealth.

        Probate is wholly dependent on statute.

       - The whole subject of probate of wills rests upon and is regulated by statute law, and the courts, in admitting a will to probate, are confined to the simple question, whether the paper admitted to probate is the true last will and testament of the deceased, and their jurisdiction cannot be extended further, for the jurisdiction of a court to probate is not to ascertain and enforce rights of property, but to establish, preserve and perpetuate an important muniment of title.

       - A soldier, not originally a resident of Roanoke, married in that city, and after the marriage, so long as he remained in Roanoke, regarded the home of his mother-in-law, with whom his wife resided, as his home. Prior to the marriage he agreed with his future wife that he would make Roanoke his home after his discharge from military service. Shortly after the marriage he went with his company to France. His wife remained in Roanoke with her mother, and in letters from France he reiterated his purpose of returning to live there permanently. It was held that the soldier was a resident of Roanoke within this section, conferring jurisdiction of the probate of wills on the circuit and corporation courts in the county or corporation wherein the decedent had a "known place of residence."

        Judgment of clerk is judgment in rem.

      <p>
       In admitting a will to probate the clerk acts in a judicial capacity and the order made by him, admitting or rejecting a will, is as much a judgment as though entered by the court.

       It is well settled in this jurisdiction and elsewhere that an order or judgment of a clerk, or court having jurisdiction of the matter, admitting a paper to probate is a judgment in rem, binding not only the immediate parties to the proceeding in which the order is had, but all other persons and all other courts with respect to property within the jurisdiction of the probate court. Such an order of probate cannot be attacked collaterally and can be assailed only in the manner provided by law. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings,

        Demurrer as collateral attack on order of probate.
       </b>
       - In a suit to construe a holographic will that had been admitted to probate by the clerk of the probate court, the lower court erred in sustaining a demurrer and dismissing the bill of complaint upon the stated holding "that the paper writing admitted to probate lacks testamentary intent." The court was without authority or jurisdiction to entertain the demurrer, which constituted a collateral attack on the order of probate. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings,

       - Although a party moved to set aside the appointment of the administrator of the estate of the decedent, because the pleadings did not establish actual notice of an attempt to probate the decedent's purported will, and actual notice would not have equated to an appearance in any event, the administrator of the estate of the decedent could proceed in the administrator's attempt to impeach the will.

It does not mean that some will other than that tendered may not be probated when more than a year has elapsed after the entry of an order allowing or refusing probate of a different will. Nor does it state or mean that a lost will may not be established in a court of equity under its general equity jurisdiction. Hawkins v. Tampa,

       permits a court upon a rehearing to correct "any injustice in the proceedings." An injustice was done to the petitioners and to other heirs and distributees who were not parties to a compromise agreement in a suit under this section. By the compromise agreement the parties sought to settle a suit to impeach the decedent's will, which suit if successful would have resulted in benefits for all the decedent's heirs and distributees. But the compromise agreement provided that certain heirs and distributees, parties to the agreement, should receive shares of the decedent's estate and that the balance of her estate should be distributed in accordance with the will. The agreement was unjust because it benefited the heirs and distributees who were parties to the agreement, but provided no benefit for the other heirs and distributees. Thomas v. Best,

         Parties may waive jury.

        - This section requiring that a "trial by jury shall be ordered" in proceedings to contest a will only means a jury trial, accompanied by all of the incidents and modes of procedure attendant upon such a proceeding. The parties have a right to waive a jury as in a common-law action, or to demur to the evidence, and a judgment of the court without a jury in such cases is not an invasion of the right of the trial by jury.

Where a will is assaulted and defended as a whole, and there is no suggestion from any source that the will may be void in part and valid as to other parts, in framing an issue under this section it is sufficient to direct the jury to ascertain whether a given paper, purporting to be the last will and testament of the testator, is the true last will and testament of the testator. It is not necessary to go further and enquire whether any part of the paper is his will. Rowland v. Rowland,

The jury are not the judges of the law in such cases, and the language of the section, "a trial by a jury shall be ordered," only means a jury trial accompanied by all the incidents and mode of procedure attendant upon such a proceeding. The word "shall" in the sentence quoted does not prevent a waiver of trial by a jury, but is to be construed in the sense of "may." Meade v. Meade,

        - In ordering an issue devisavit vel non, the chancellor does not exercise any of the ordinary powers of a chancery court, but acts in obedience to the express mandate of this section; the object of the issue being to ascertain, by means of a jury trial, whether or not the will admitted to probate is, in whole or in part, the will of the decedent.

        - The verdict of a jury on the issue devisavit vel non, although the finding is for the validity of the writing produced for the will, is not a probate of the will, nor is the verdict finding against the validity of the writing a final determination of its rejection for probate. The return of a verdict by a jury and the verdict itself are incidents in the progress of the trial to test the validity of the will. The finality of the validity or invalidity of the writing is the judgment of the trial court accepting or rejecting the verdict. Culpeper Nat'l Bank v. Morris,

       § 64.2-451. Appointment of curator; when made; his duties.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The court or the clerk of such court, or his duly qualified deputy, may appoint a curator of the estate of a decedent during a contest about the decedent's will, during the infancy or in the absence of an executor, or until administration of the estate be granted and may require the curator to give a bond in a reasonable penalty. The curator shall ensure that the estate is not wasted before the qualification of an executor or administrator, or before such estate lawfully comes into possession of such executor or administrator. The curator may demand, sue for, recover, and receive the decedent's personal estate and all debts due to the testator. The curator may lease or receive the rents and profits of any real estate that the decedent possessed when he died. The curator shall pay debts, to the extent that there are sufficient assets to do so in the order of payment prescribed by law, and may be sued in the same manner as an executor or administrator. Upon the qualification of an executor or administrator, the curator shall account for and pay and deliver to him such estate as he controls or may be liable for.

        Section does not protect purchaser of personalty.
       </b>
       - There is no provision of statute in favor of or saving any rights of persons taking personal property under an unknown and unrecorded will, as against distributees, as there is of the rights of persons taking real estate under an unknown and unrecorded will. By this section, such a saving of rights in real estate is made for a period of seven years (now one year). Bliss v. Spencer,

        Purchaser entitled to protection absent record notice and information putting prudent person on inquiry.
       </b>
       - Where the clerk's records were silent and the purchaser could not be charged with any knowledge imputed from them and there is no evidence that the purchaser possessed any information which would put a prudent person on inquiry as to the existence of any flaw in the apparent devolution of title to the seller by intestate succession, the purchaser was entitled to the protection of this section.

        Checking of records does not imply advance knowledge of what might be disclosed.
       </b>
       - The fact that the purchaser checked the land records, on his attorney's advice, to ascertain whether a will was filed, gives rise to no inference that he had reason to believe such a will existed. A check of the land records before recording a deed is an act of simple prudence customary among lawyers. It is a neutral fact which furnishes no basis for an inference that the examiner either has, or lacks, advance knowledge of the facts such an examination might disclose. Cheatham v. Gregory,
       <cite class="va_code">
        227 Va. 1

        Purchaser need only pay value.
       </b>
       - A purchaser seeking the protection of the recording acts is not required to pay "fair and adequate" consideration. The statute applies if he simply has paid value. Cheatham v. Gregory,
       <cite class="va_code">

The court refused to apply the law of Japan, as urged by the parents, because Japanese law did not require any additional step to qualify a person to bring suit on behalf of a decedent, which directly conflicted with Virginia law which required the appointment of a fiduciary.

However, if, during the first 45 days following the decedent's death, any distributee notifies the court or the clerk of an intent to qualify after the 45-day period has elapsed, the court or the clerk shall not grant administration to any such organization until the court or the clerk has given all such distributees an opportunity to be heard.

        64.1-116 together it is clear that a distributee who applies for administration and is appointed and qualifies can only be removed for cause; and the same principle applies to an appointee in whose favor a distributee waives his right to qualify. By substitution such person is clothed with all the rights of the distributee and occupies the same plane. When therefore the appointment, either of a distributee or of some other person designated by him, has been made and the appointee has qualified, the power of the court or clerk is exhausted, and no further appointment can be made until a vacancy occurs in the office in some way recognized by law.

        Executor has only a power of sale.
       </b>
       - A direction in a will that land be sold by executors gives them only a power of sale, and no interest in the land. A suit to recover the land must be brought by the heirs. The title to the land devolves upon the heirs upon the death of the testator, subject to be divested only by lawful execution of the power of sale. Coles v. Jamerson,

        Or a power coupled with an interest.
       </b>
       - In a case where a will directed executors to sell land, it was held that the will vested in the executors an interest and a trust, which survived them, and it was the duty of the administrator c.t.a. to take possession of the land and to account for the rents and profits until sold. Mosby's Adm'r v. Mosby's Adm'r, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 584 (1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon this question of the construction of a will, as to when the power given the executors is not a mere naked one, but one that is coupled with an interest, see Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224 (1872); Mills v. Mills' Ex'rs, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 442 (1877).

       - A testator, being about to leave the country, made his will, and devised that in case of his death, or if he should not be heard of for ten years, his land should be sold for the best price that could be got, as was directed by a letter of attorney to J. H. of the same date with the will, and the proceeds divided among the testator's four sisters. It was held that the administrator with the will annexed had power to sell the land, under this section.

       , 69 S.E.2d 409 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is broad enough to authorize the sale of stocks, bonds and other property, "as are likely to be impaired in value by keeping." Any further right to sell arises from the duty of the personal representative to protect and conserve the assets of the estate, or to make correct distribution to the legatees or distributees. Virginia Trust Co. v. Evans,
       <cite class="va_code">
        193 Va. 425

       <b>
        Power to sell stocks.
       </b>
       - So long as executors, in good faith and in exercise of reasonable discretion, consider it to the best interest of the estate to retain stocks, though of a somewhat speculative character, they enjoy no right to sell (there being no testamentary direction nor any actual necessity to sell). Pritchett v. First Nat'l Bank,
       <cite class="va_code">

        Determining perishability of goods.
       </b>
       - In determining which of the goods and chattels of a testator, or intestate, shall be sold as "likely to be impaired in value by keeping," some latitude of discretion must be allowed to the executor or administrator; and his conduct appearing to be fair, and, probably, proceeding from a good intention, ought to be sanctioned by a court of equity.

       <b>
        Security need not be "bond."
       </b>
       - Under this section if the length of credit is reasonable the circumstance that the security taken was not a "bond" is immaterial, certainly in equity, if the security taken was regarded as "good security" at the time, by the personal representative acting in good faith and with reasonable diligence - that is, acting in the exercise of a fair discretion and in the same manner that a reasonably prudent business man would have acted under the same circumstances had the subject been his own property.

        Devastavit in giving credit.

       - An administrator sold the stock of goods and store fixtures of his decedent for a sum, terms cash. The purchaser paid part cash and told the administrator he could not pay the rest but that a bank had agreed to loan him the remaining amount on condition that the administrator would deposit the same in the bank and allow it to remain there for thirty days. The judge before whom the administrator qualified was a director in this bank and solicited him to make this deposit. The administrator had never heard any rumors to the effect that the bank was not financially sound, though there were such rumors. It was held that under this section the administrator was not guilty of a devastavit in giving the credit he gave the purchaser in this manner for the balance. Herelick v.

       - The plain interpretation of this section is that the personal estate of a decedent is the natural and primary fund for the payment of his debts and legacies, and, as a general rule, must be first exhausted before the real estate can be made liable; and the personal estate will not be exonerated in charging the real estate, even when there is a specific lien for a debt on the real estate, unless there are express words or a plain intent in the will to make such exoneration.

        Debt attributable to decedent's estate.
       </b>
       - The estate was liable to pay the mortgage debt based on two questions: (1) whether the decedent had a personal obligation to pay the debt; and (2) whether the mortgage debt was secured by real property owned by the decedent upon his death. The answer to the first question was that the decedent was personally and solely liable for the note that he signed, and therefore, the mortgage debt was a debt of his estate. In answer to the second question, the mortgage debt was not secured by real property owned by the decedent upon his death. The decedent's ownership interest did not survive his death. The spouses owned the property as tenants by the entirety with the right of survivorship. Therefore, the property passed to the surviving spouse by operation of law and was not part of the estate.

        Purpose.
       </b>
       - The object of this section was to do away with the distinction between debts chargeable on decedent's lands at common law and simple contract debts, and not to disarrange the order of liability of the assets of a decedent's estate, which had been firmly established by a long line of adjudication. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615 (1857); Peirce v. Graham,

        Personal estate primary fund for payment of debts.
       </b>
       - The Supreme Court has held repeatedly since this section, making real estate of a decedent assets for the payment of his debts, went into effect that personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of debts. Duerson's Adm'r v. Alsop, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 229 (1876); Lewis v. Overby's Adm'r, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 601 (1879); Ryan's Adm'r v. McLeod, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 367 (1879); Edmunds v. Scott,
       <cite class="va_code">
        78 Va. 720
       </cite>
       (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section recognizes the common-law right of the ancestor to indicate the charges he wishes to make upon the land for such of his debts as he may prefer, but it does not alter or enlarge the common-law liability of the personalty of a decedent as the primary fund for the payment of his debts, or give to a testator the right to prefer his creditors out of his personal assets, as it does in the case of realty. Deering &amp; Co. v. Kerfoot,

        Hence, there can be no resort to decedent's real estate to pay his debts until his personalty has been exhausted.
       </b>
       When that has been exhausted, whether by devastavit or distribution, the real estate in the hands of his heirs may be subjected. Scott v. Ashlin,
       <cite class="va_code">

        This section makes real estate assets merely, to be disposed of as personal assets;
       </b>
       and a creditor has no lien upon the assets. He has a right to have the whole applied in a due course of administration. Peirce v. Graham,

        But need not be distributed as personalty.
       </b>
       - Real assets often come to the hands of the personal representative and it is his duty when he receives such to pay the same to such persons as are entitled thereto. They are, however, assets in his hands, the same as personal assets for the payment of the decedent's debts and need not be distributed as personalty. Johnson v. Coleman, 1 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 191 (1915).

      <p>
       <b>
        Under this section the words "all lawful demands against his estate" mean charges or lawful demands against the decedent
       </b>
       and not those incurred as expenses in the administration of the estate. United States v. Willcox, 73 F.2d 781 (4th Cir. 1934).

      <p>
       <b>
        Debts need not be reduced to judgment.
       </b>
       - Under this section the real estate of a decedent is an asset for the payment of his debts regardless of whether such debts have been reduced to judgment. Morrison v. Morrison,
       <cite class="va_code">
        177 Va. 417

      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not apply to real estate on which debtor has created a lien.
       </b>
       - This section does not apply, except subject to the encumbrance, to the real estate on which the debtor has created a bona fide lien, which is good against himself. Hence, where the decedent has subjected his whole estate to the payment of his debts, his general creditors must take the real estate under the charge in the will and must take it in the plight and condition in which he held it; and it is equitable assets, though the statute would have subjected it to the payment of his debts if there had been no such charge in the will. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615 (1857).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        This section does not alter the rule that no judgment against the personal representative can bind the heirs,
       </b>
       or in any manner affect them. It makes real estate descended or devised (not charged by the will with debts) legal assets in the hands of the heirs and devisees; but there would seem to be the same lack of privity now as before between the personal representatives and the heir or devisee. Peirce v. Graham,

        Lack of privity between personal representative and heirs or devisees unaffected.
       </b>
       - Under this section there would seem to be lack of privity as before between the personal representatives and the heirs or devisees. The executor is charged as such with the administration of the personal assets and such real assets as may be charged with the payment of debts by the will; but otherwise his relations to the land descended or devised remain as heretofore; that is, as such he has no concern with them whatever.

       </b>
       - Where an administrator recovers judgment against an administratrix on a debt due plaintiffs' intestate, and sues out a fieri facias which is returned nulla bona, and plaintiff dies and administrator de bonis non is granted, an action of debt lies at the relation of the administrator de bonis non on defendant's administration bond, and not at the relation of the representative of plaintiff's administrator.

      </p>

       The administrator de bonis non need not, in order to entitle himself to put the administration bond in suit, bring scire facias or action of debt on the judgment recovered by the first administrator. Allen v. Cunningham, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 395 (1831).

       - Although in the case of a creditor, a demand must be established against an executor before a suit can be brought on the administration bond, yet in the case of a legatee, a suit in equity may be brought upon it in the first instance, because the decree can be made so as to operate against the executor in the first instance, and an account of the assets can be taken at once.

        Equitable relief against judgment.

       - Notwithstanding a judgment against administrators, as such, in an action of debt, to which they pleaded "payment by the intestate," and a subsequent judgment, against them personally, in an action suggesting a devastavit, to which they pleaded "no waste," relief in equity was granted them on the grounds that the peculiar and perplexed state of the assets made it difficult, if not impracticable, to plead in relation thereto, at law; and that, at the trial of the second action, their principal counsel was absent, and their assistant counsel withdrew from the cause, in consequence whereof they were wholly undefended, and a verdict, perhaps contrary to justice, was obtained against them, without any negligence or default on their part.

       - Where the assets in the hands of an executor are insufficient to pay all the debts of the estate and he makes distribution of the estate without requiring a refunding bond from the legatees or distributees, he is personally liable to creditors for the funds so improperly distributed.

       Where there is insufficient personal estate to pay all debts, the administrator, although he may have no actual notice of their existence, takes the risk of personal liability for payment of debts if he distributes the personal estate before awaiting the 12 (now six) months allowed by statute for presentation of debts and before then obtaining protection from personal liability therefor by refunding bonds, or before such protection is afforded him by order of court under

       - Pursuant to this section, a general legacy payable in no special manner, where the will is silent as to time of payment and as to when interest is to begin to run, is not payable until one year (now six months) after the executor's qualification, and does not bear interest until payable.

        Representative may distribute estate as soon as all debts are paid.
       </b>
       - It is the duty of an administrator to distribute the personal estate after the payment of debts. It is also right so to do. It is out of regard for creditors only that administrators cannot be "compelled" to make distribution of the estate within the year (now six months) from their qualification. So that where there are no creditors there is nothing in our statute law to forbid an administrator from distributing the personal estate within the year (now six months). And the true policy of the law, in the absence of such a statute, would seem to favor a reasonably prompt distribution amongst those entitled under the statute of distributions, rather than a holding of the estate by the fiduciary for the year (now six months). Bliss v. Spencer,
       <cite class="va_code">

        Distribution before will discovered.
       </b>
       - If an administrator acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain whether a will exists, and when acting with reasonable prudence in that regard, does not think and has no reasonable ground to think that a will exists, he may safely distribute the estate, so far as persons taking under a then unknown and unrecorded will are concerned, whether it be within the year (now six months) of, or after the expiration of the year (now six months) from, the qualification.

However, if any creditor of the decedent establishes a debt or demand against the decedent's estate by judgment therefor or by confirmation of a report of the commissioner of accounts that allows the debt or demand, a suit may be maintained on such refunding bond, in the name of the obligee or his personal representative, for the benefit of such creditor, and a recovery shall be had thereon to the same extent that would have been had if such obligee or his personal representative had satisfied such debt or demand.

        This section did not apply

       to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because it was not a creditor of the decedent's estate. Instead, the IRS was a creditor of the taxpayer, a legatee under the will. United States v. Cameron,

        Section protects representative against subsequent claims of distributees.
       </b>
       - An administrator who has acted in good faith, and complied with every requirement of this chapter, and, in obedience to an order of the court of his appointment, has paid over (without a refunding bond) the funds in his hands to one whom the court has adjudged to be the sole distributee of the estate, will be protected against the demands of those who come in several years thereafter claiming to be entitled to share in the distribution of the estate. While this chapter does not expressly mention distributees, the legal effect of compliance therewith is to give protection as fully as though the chapter had so declared in express terms. This chapter is full, ample and complete, and guards and protects every interest as amply as could be done by a formal suit in chancery. Carter v. Skillman,

       - Action was available against adminstratrix since she was also legatee of the estate of a decedent and even though the estate funds had been disbursed; an estate was never "closed" in Virginia.

       Except during the pendency of a suit to contest the decedent's will or during the infancy or absence of the executor, the court where the will was admitted to probate or that has jurisdiction to grant administration on the decedent's estate, or the clerk of such court, shall, if there has been no executor or administrator on the decedent's estate for more than two months and on the motion of any person, order any person of the county or city to take into his possession the estate of such decedent and administer the same after requiring such person post a proper bond. However, any sheriff so ordered may decline the appointment if the appointment interferes with his current duties or obligations. The person ordered to take possession of the decedent's estate shall be the administrator, or administrator de bonis non, of the decedent, with his will annexed, if there be a will, and shall be entitled to all the rights and bound to perform all the duties of such administrator.

      RIGHT TO REVOKE AND METHOD TO REVOKE DEED:
      Before my death, I have the right to revoke this deed.
      Under the Uniform Real Property Transfer on Death Act, an instrument is effective to revoke a recorded transfer on death deed, or any part of it, only if the instrument:
      1. Is one of the following:
      a. A transfer on death deed that revokes the transfer on death deed or part of the transfer on death deed expressly;
      b. A transfer on death deed that names a designated beneficiary that is inconsistent with the designated beneficiary in a prior transfer on death deed;
      c. An instrument of revocation that expressly revokes the transfer on death deed or part of the transfer on death deed; or
      d. An inter vivos deed that expressly revokes the transfer on death deed or part of the transfer on death deed.
      2. Is acknowledged by the transferor after the acknowledgment of the transfer on death deed being revoked and recorded before
      the transferor's death in the land records of the clerk's office of the circuit court where the deed is recorded.
      After this transfer on death deed is recorded, it can be revoked only by an effective revocatory instrument recorded prior to the death of the transferor and may not be revoked by a revocatory act taken against or on the original or a copy of the recorded transfer on death deed.
      The execution and recordation of this transfer on death deed does not limit the effect of an inter vivos transfer of the property.
      At my death, a beneficiary takes the property subject to all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the property is subject at my death.

        Self-settled trusts ineffective to shield assets.
       </b>
       - The restriction that a trust can not "operate to the prejudice of any existing creditor of the creator of such trust" is the self-settled rule and has been consistently interpreted to prevent a self-settled trust from being exempt from the settlor-beneficiary's creditors; a spendthrift trust cannot be created by the beneficiary to shield his own assets from claims of his own creditors.

       - Uniform Trust Code has not altered the fundamental principles that in construing, enforcing and administrating wills and trusts, the testator's or settlor's intent prevails over the desires of the beneficiaries, and that intent is to be ascertained by the language the testator or settlor used in creating the will or trust because the Uniform Trust Code has not so altered the law as to permit beneficiaries, after the death of a testator, to defeat the terms of his will that postpone their enjoyment of his bounty, merely because they would rather have their money today than wait.

        No-contest clause.
       </b>
       - Circuit court did not err when it denied a trustee's demurrer and ruled that it was proper for the circuit court to determine whether the trustee acted in conformity with the authority granted under the terms of the trust. There was sufficient evidence upon which a court could determine that the trustee's decision to find the testator's sons in violation of the trust's no contest clause was not motivated by a desire to carry out the testator's intent or to protect the beneficiaries and was therefore done in bad faith.

        Trust provision prevailed.
       </b>
       - In a case alleging a mismanagement of irrevocable trusts, a demurrer was sustained on a claim that a trustee breached a duty by failing to file causes of action for legal malpractice and conversion because the language of the trust provision at issue made it clear that the trustee retained the option of instituting litigation until it was indemnified against all costs and liabilities, and the complaint failed to allege that the trustee was ever indemnified in such a manner. The trust provision prevailed over statutory law. Burton v. Dolph, 89 Va. Cir. 101, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 129 (Norfolk June 27, 2014).

      - Entirety of decedent's estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedent's will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not required, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust Mirman v.

       26-54 are considered, they lend weight to the view that the General Assembly intended by the act to broaden the scope of charitable trusts and prevent their failure even though they are general and indefinite. Under former similar provisions, trusts which depend upon the discretion and personal confidence of the trustee in their exercise, where he refuses or fails to act, may be enforced by a substituted trustee who is given the power to exercise the discretion and personal confidence which was vested in the original trustee.

        Factors in determining general charitable intent.
       </b>
       - The background of the testator, his interest and spirit in community projects, his education and business acumen, may all be considered in determining his general charitable intent, unless the same is foreclosed by the precise language of the will. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).

      <p>
       <b>
        Limiting uses by words "none other" does not foreclose consideration of such intent.
       </b>
       - Where the testator devised and bequeathed his estate to his executors "to be held by them for the following uses and purposes and none other," use of the words "none other" does not foreclose any consideration of general charitable intent. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965) (decided under prior law).

        The fact that the gift is for an indefinite number of persons is characteristic of a charitable or public trust.

        Creation of charitable trust.
       </b>
       - Entirety of decedent's estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedent's will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not required, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust.

       A trust may be created to provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor's lifetime. The trust terminates upon the death of the animal or, if the trust was created to provide for the care of more than one animal alive during the settlor's lifetime, upon the death of the last surviving animal.

The appointed person shall have the rights of a trust beneficiary for the purpose of enforcing the trust, including receiving accountings, notices, and other information from the trustee and providing consents. Reasonable compensation for a person appointed by the court may be paid from the assets of the trust.

If the settlor is deceased, such property shall be distributed pursuant to the residuary clause of the settlor's will if the trust for the animal was created in a preresiduary clause in the will or pursuant to the residuary provisions of the inter vivos trust if the trust for the animal was created in a preresiduary clause in the trust instrument; otherwise, such property shall be distributed to the settlor's successors in interest.

      Mere inclusion of a spendthrift restriction was insufficient alone to establish a presumption of a material purpose that prevented termination by consent of the beneficiaries; the material purpose of the trust was to provide income for the individual's life, and such purpose was not defeated by termination of the trust, inasmuch as she could enjoy that income at a reduced cost to her if the trust was terminated, and the beneficiaries were entitled to termination of the trust.

       - Moving party did not meet its burden to show that a decedent's trust should be modified to eliminate the requirement that the trust be administered by an institutional trustee. It seemed clear that the decedent intended for the trust to always have a non-individual trustee overseeing the administration of the trust. In re Estate of Brown, 87 Va. Cir. 353, 2013 Va. Cir.

       <b>
        Former similar provisions were intended to prevent failure of charitable trusts.
       </b>
       - They were enacted to aid in the supervision and enforcement of charitable trusts to prevent their failure occasioned by impossibility of specific performance. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).

        Charitable gifts are viewed with peculiar favor

       by the courts in Virginia and every presumption consistent with the language contained in the instruments of gift will be employed in order to sustain them. All doubts will be resolved in their favor. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).

        And legislature may authorize courts to apply cy pres doctrine.
       </b>
       - The legislature cannot terminate a charitable trust, nor change its administration on the ground of expediency, nor seek to control its disposition under the doctrine of cy pres. However, this does not suggest that the legislature cannot properly reserve to the judicial branch of government the power to do these acts. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).

       <b>
        Prerequisites for invoking doctrine.
       </b>
       - Before invoking the cy pres doctrine, it is necessary that there be (1) a valid charitable trust without a gift over, (2) an existing general charitable intent, and (3) the beneficiaries must be indefinite or uncertain, or (4) the purpose of the trust must be indefinite, impossible to perform, or so impracticable of performance as to characterize the fulfillment of the purpose as "impossible."

        Self-settled trusts ineffective to shield assets.
       </b>
       - The restriction that a trust can not "operate to the prejudice of any existing creditor of the creator of such trust" is the self-settled rule and has been consistently interpreted to prevent a self-settled trust from being exempt from the settlor-beneficiary's creditors; a spendthrift trust cannot be created by the beneficiary to shield his own assets from claims of his own creditors.

Where the trustee is given the power to pay to him the income for such purposes as she may consider proper, but it is plain that the dominant purpose is to provide a support and maintenance for him, as against his creditors, the trustee may expend or pay to him for his support and maintenance only so much of the income as may be reasonably necessary or proper for such purpose.

        The defining characteristics of a spendthrift trust are three in number.
       </b>
       The trust must provide for the support and maintenance of its beneficiary. In addition, the settlor must intend, whether evidenced by express provision or implied from the four corners of the trust instrument, to protect the trust from the beneficiary's creditors. Lastly, the settlor must intend also to prevent the beneficiary's voluntary or involuntary alienation. In re Hersch, 57 Bankr. 667 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A spendthrift trust has three defining characteristics: First, the trust must provide for the support and maintenance of its beneficiary; second, the settlor must intend to protect the trust from the beneficiary's creditor; and third, the settlor must intend to prevent the beneficiary's voluntary or involuntary alienation of trust property. Levey v. First Va. Bank, 845 F.2d 80 (4th Cir. 1988).

       <b>
        Instrument construed to carry out intent of settlor.
       </b>
       - Once it has been established that the requisite formalities of a spendthrift trust have been complied with, a court must focus its attention on the intent of the settlor when he created the trust at issue, and further, the court is bound to construe the instrument as far as possible to carry out the intention and purpose of the settlor. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Intent to create trust must be manifest.

      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        And may be gleaned from instrument as whole.

        Spendthrift trusts are not restricted to those where remainder is given to some other person or reverts to creator or his estate.

       - Former version of this section does not expressly or by necessary implication restrict the trusts for support and maintenance to which provisions against alienation and freedom from debts may lawfully be attached to those in which the remainder in the trust property is given to some other person or reverts to the creator or his estate. There is nothing in the language of the former section which would make such provisions invalid in a devise giving property in trust to a trustee for the support and maintenance of a person either for a term of years or for his life with remainder to him in the trust property upon the termination of the prospective trust.

Also, the spendthrift provisions of this trust removing the debtor's assets from the reach of creditors were unenforceable for the reason that the settlor was also the beneficiary. As a result, the trust did not qualify as a valid traditional spendthrift trust under "applicable nonbankruptcy law" and, therefore, the property could not be excluded from the debtor's bankruptcy estate.

       Intent to revoke.

      - Trial court granted partial summary judgment to the trustee after the conservator and trustee battled over the continued viability of their father's revocable trust created approximately 10 years earlier; the trial court found that the trust stated how the trust could be revoked, by written instrument delivered to the trustee, and that neither that type of conduct or any other manifestation of intent in the case occurred that would signal the testator's intent to revoke the trust.

       - On appeal from the parties' divorce action, the husband's evidence supported the trial court's determination that a farm was held in a revocable trust. Thus, the parties' retention of the right to revoke the trust supported the conclusion that the property remained marital and subject to equitable distribution. Spreadbury v.

      - Entirety of decedent's estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedent's will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not required, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust Mirman v.

        Disposition of stock through trust.

       - In a dispute over the disposition of stock in a family held business, an argument that a trust did not constitute an immediate family member was rejected; the inter vivos trust was simply a method of transferring the stock to immediate family members, and disposing of property by trust was merely a way of conveying it to both the beneficiaries and the trustee. However, because the owner's method of bequeathing her shares by way of the trust did not satisfy the terms of the shareholders' agreement, it did not exempt those shares from a mandatory purchase scheme.

A general authorization in a controlling document authorizing a trustee to invest in such assets as the trustee, in his sole discretion, may deem best, or other language purporting to expand the trustee's investment powers, shall not be construed to waive the rule of subsection A unless the controlling document expressly manifests an intention that it be waived (i) by reference to the "prudent man" or "prudent investor" rule, (ii) by reference to power of the trustee to make "speculative" investments, (iii) by an express authorization to acquire or retain a specific asset or type of asset such as a closely held business, or (iv) by other language synonymous with clause (i), (ii) or (iii). A trustee shall not be liable to a beneficiary for the trustee's good faith reliance on a waiver of the rule of subsection A.

       - Where there is nothing in the trust instruments to indicate that the trustor intended to restrict investments to those enumerated in the statutes in effect at the time of the execution of the instruments, it is the natural and legal presumption that the trustor intended that the trustees could make such investments as were lawful and proper under the statutes in effect at the time the investments were made.

      - Beneficiary of a separate, unfunded sub-trust lacked standing to bring a direct action against the trustee of the primary trust, personally and in the trustee's representative capacity, for alleged mismanagement of the primary trust because the beneficiary did not have an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest in the primary trust. The beneficiary's beneficial interest in the separate, unfunded sub-trust was too indirect and remote to confer standing upon the beneficiary in relation to the primary trust. Garcia v. Suda, 94 Va.

       - Judgment was entered in favor of a decedent's co-executors and attorneys' fees were granted against a trustee, attorney in fact, and executor of certain trust documents (the fiduciary) based on a fiduciary's conversion of funds, self-dealing, and overall violation of fiduciary duty because the decedent, while still legally competent, was vulnerable to being manipulated by someone with impressive professional credentials, who played to his ego, there was no credible evidence presented rebutting the inference of fraud concerning the insider dealing by the fiduciary, and the fiduciary provided nothing to show what was done with the decedent's money, other than the use of it to pay his personal bills and living expenses.

       In this section, "payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer, including a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan. For purposes of subsections D, E, F, and G, the term also includes any payment from a separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.

If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not "required to be made" to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.

         Compensation dependent upon facts of particular case.
        </b>
        - The amount of compensation to which a trustee is entitled is clearly dependent upon the facts of a particular case. It is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule when so many factors may be involved. The court must rely on the general principles above and look to the value of the services performed under the circumstances, the results obtained, and the responsibilities assumed by the trustee. In re Manning, 43 Bankr. 712 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984).

       <p>
        <b>
         No hard and fast rule as to compensation.
        </b>
        - Inasmuch as this section fails to lay down a hard and fast rule, the court should not do so. A fair construction of the statute seems to be that if the fiduciary sells property, of whatever kind, he is generally entitled to a commission of five percent on the receipts. If he has the right to sell, but those entitled to the proceeds of sale prefer to take the property in kind, then he is generally entitled to receive five percent commission upon the appraised value of the property. If he is not entitled to sell the property, but must deliver in kind (except in the case of a specific legacy), he is only entitled to a reasonable compensation to be fixed by the commissioner, or court, upon the proper proof of the expense incurred, the risk taken, and the services rendered in connection with the property so delivered to those entitled thereto.

        The amount of compensation to which a personal representative may be entitled is dependent upon the facts of the particular case. Since it is still practically impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule because of the many factors involved, the court must rely on general principles, remembering that the personal representative is entitled to a reasonable reward, commensurate with the value of his services under the attendant circumstances, the results obtained, and the responsibility assumed. In some instances five percent upon the appraised value of property coming into his hands would not be sufficient; in others it would be too much. Virginia Trust Co. v. Evans,

        </b>
        - To allow a fiduciary in every case a commission of five percent on legacies delivered in kind might place upon the legatee too onerous a burden, and in many cases where the estate is large and easy of settlement, a commission of five percent is out of proportion to the actual work required or performed. On the other hand, a rule disallowing all commissions in such cases is too restricted to meet the requirements of modern business. Jones v. Virginia Trust Co.,

In cases where the language of the testator is susceptible of more than one construction, the question becomes one of interpretation which the courts must settle by ascertaining the probable intention and understanding of the parties.

        <b>
         In general, an executor is chargeable with interest on balances in his hands.
        </b>
        Burwell's Ex'rs v. Anderson, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 348 (1831).
       </p>

        <b>
         But it is not to be compounded.
        </b>
        - At the close of an administration account, the interest due from the administrator is not to bear interest. Morris' Adm'r v. Morris' Adm'r, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 293 (1848).

       <p>
        <b>
         Except under special circumstances.
        </b>
        - Compound interest will be charged against an executor or trustee where a testator expressly directs an accumulation, or where trust moneys are used by a trustee for his own benefit in carrying on his own trade, but ordinarily the trustee or executor is not chargeable with compound interest. Russell v. Passmore,

         Circumstances of case control.
        </b>
        - The propriety or impropriety of charging an executor interest on uninvested sums of money in his hands always depends upon the particular circumstances of each case. Bickers v. Shenandoah Valley Nat'l Bank,
        <cite class="va_code">

        <b>
         Executor not liable for interest where delay reasonable.
        </b>
        - As a general rule the personal liability of an executor to distributees of an estate, for interest, where there has been delay in the closing and settlement of the estate, depends entirely upon whether the delay was reasonable or unreasonable under all the circumstances of the particular case. The executor is free from personal liability for interest where the delay is reasonable, and chargeable with interest where the delay is determined to be unreasonable. Bickers v. Shenandoah Valley Nat'l Bank,
        <cite class="va_code">

         Interest allowed guardian on expenditures.
        </b>
        - A guardian is not entitled to interest from date of expenditure on small individual items of disbursements in the yearly statements. It is only when a large sum is disbursed early in the year and when, under the circumstances, it would work an unreasonable hardship upon the guardian not so to do, that interest will be allowed him on any item of disbursement from the date of payment. As to small items of disbursement, no interest should be allowed during the year. Bliss v. Spencer,

        26-30, did not identify which services were performed in its roles as conservator, guardian, and trustee, and as the fiduciary was not entitled to payment for services for which no legal professional skill or judgment was required, the fiduciary was to provide additional information on its fees and services.

         Reasonableness of compensation.
        </b>
        - Successor conservator sought compensation and allowance for fees and expenses incurred in taking over the estate, which were necessary to the estate's administration; since such fees and expenses would be billed to the estate, the insurer was only liable for those that would have been allowable to the estate, and thus the statute applied and the insurer was only liable for the fees and expenses to the extent they were reasonable. In re Estate of Bone, 91 Va. Cir. 547, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 157 (Chesapeake Nov. 21, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining reasonableness of fees to the attorney/successor conservator, all legal services were be judged according to the case law standard regarding the reasonableness of attorney fees, and all non-legal services were to be judged according to the standard established by the caselaw interpreting the statute; evidence was permitted to be presented in this regard to make this determination.

       - Chancery commissioner erred in finding that the claimant did not hold the property he claimed by adverse possession under the necessary claim of right; the claimant provided clear and convincing evidence satisfying the hostility requirement by introducing proof that he believed that a particular line on the ground represented the extent of his land and that he treated all the land within the line as his own, and, thus, the trial court had a duty to correct the chancery commissioner's erroneous conclusion in the chancery commissioner's report that found the claimant had not proved he had title to the disputed property by adverse possession.

        Where the waiver is contained in the decedent's will, the trustee shall within 90 days after qualification notify in writing all beneficiaries of the trust, other than the trustee, who are adults, whose addresses are known to the trustee, and to whom income or principal of the trust could be currently distributed; provide each such beneficiary with a copy of the applicable provisions of the will; advise each such beneficiary of his right to require an annual accounting; and provide each such beneficiary with a copy of this section and annually thereafter provide each such beneficiary an accounting upon request. The trustee shall send to the commissioner of accounts a copy of the notice given to each beneficiary or, in the alternative, file a writing with the commissioner of accounts stating that the requirements of this section have been met.

       The removal of a trustee is within the reasonable discretion of the court. More is required to remove a trustee appointed by the creator of the trust than is required to remove one appointed by the court. In all cases the real guide is whether or not it is best for the trust estate that the trustee be removed. Friction between the trustee and the beneficiary is not in itself sufficient ground for removal. Some beneficial end must be achieved by the removal or it will not be justified. Clark v. Grasty,

       - The United States Veterans' Bureau (now Veterans' Administration), not having a direct beneficial interest in the estate of an incompetent ex-serviceman, may not be a "party interested" in the limited and technical sense, yet where the entire fund in question is the compensation paid to the incompetent by the Veterans' Bureau (now Veterans' Administration), the Bureau is materially interested in performing its duty and paying the fund over to a proper committee.

     <p>
      After reasonable notice to a trustee, whether appointed by will, deed, or other writing, the circuit court that has jurisdiction to administer the trust may, on motion of any interested person, order the trustee to give bond with surety before the court, or before the clerk of the court, within a reasonable time and in a penalty to be prescribed by the court, for the faithful execution of the trust if the court deems the bond is proper for the security of the trust estate. If the order is not complied with, or whenever for any cause it appears proper, the court may remove the trustee and appoint another in his place.

       If the circuit court having jurisdiction of any estate in the process of administration by any guardian, conservator, curator, executor, administrator, trustee, receiver, or other fiduciary, determines that the size of the bond required of the fiduciary would be burdensome or for other cause, the court may order a portion or all of the personal assets of the estate, as the court deems proper, to be placed with a designated bank, trust company, or savings institution, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency and doing business in the Commonwealth, with consideration being given to any bank, trust company, or savings institution proposed by the fiduciary. When the original assets are placed with a designated financial institution, the financial institution shall issue in the name of the estate and file with the court a receipt for such assets and shall give the fiduciary a copy of the receipt. The receipt shall acknowledge that:

After the receipt of the financial institution for the original assets placed with the financial institution has been filed with the court, the court shall enter an order waiving the bond to be given or previously given by the fiduciary or reduce it so that the bond applies only to the estate remaining in the possession of the fiduciary, whichever the court deems best for the estate.

The receipt and acceptance thereof by the financial institution shall relieve the person or corporation from all further responsibility.

The financial institution shall evidence its acceptance or rejection by filing the same with the court or the clerk of the court making the designation within 15 days after actual knowledge of the designation shall have come to the attention of the financial institution. In the event of acceptance, the financial institution shall be allowed as a proper charge against the assets placed with it such reasonable amount for its services and expenses as the court making the designation may order.

       Scope of liability.

      - Statute recognized the basic principle that the court could not hold a trustee, or anyone else, liable for decisions that it did not and could not have made. Rollins v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. of Va., 56 Va. Cir. 147, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 146 (Roanoke 2001).
     </p>
     <p>
      Statute clearly prohibited the imposition of liability on the trustee for failing to do what he had no ability to do. Rollins v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. of Va., 56 Va. Cir. 147, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 146 (Roanoke 2001).
     </p>
     <p>
      Under subsection D, the prohibition on recovery did not excuse a trustee from liability for failing to participate in the administration of the trust or for failing to attempt to prevent a breach of trust; thus a trustee could be held liable for a loss caused by his conduct for actions which he was entrusted to take. Rollins v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. of Va., 56 Va. Cir. 147, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 146 (Roanoke 2001).

        Purpose of section.
       </b>
       - This section merely authorizes the court, in a suit against an administrator on a debt due from his decedent, to enter a judgment without an account of the transactions of the representative. Such a judgment would ordinarily carry costs with it. To prevent an estate from being depleted by having to bear the costs of litigation against it made necessary by the stubborn and imprudent attitude of the personal representative, the court, even where it enters a judgment to be paid out of the estate, may make the representative personally liable for the costs. This is the only effect and purpose of the section. In re Butler, 20 F. Supp. 995 (W.D. Va. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Judgment should recite that it is to be paid from estate.

       - This section does not alter the general rule that, where a judgment against a personal representative should be paid and is intended to be paid from the assets of his decedent's estate, the judgment should so recite. In re Butler, 20 F. Supp. 995 (W.D. Va. 1937).

      When a report of the accounts of any guardian, curator, conservator, committee, or trustee is confirmed, either in whole or in a qualified manner, the circuit court for the clerk's office where the report is filed may order payment of what appears due on such accounts to such persons as would be entitled to recover the same by suit.

        Foreign personal representative.
       </b>
       - Since the 1950 amendment of this section a personal representative, who is not a resident of Virginia and who has not qualified or been appointed as such in the state, cannot maintain an action in a United States district court sitting in Virginia, under the Virginia Statute of Death by Wrongful Act. Holt v. Middlebrook, 214 F.2d 187 (4th Cir. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       A nonresident personal representative who was not qualified in Virginia under this section could not maintain an action in a federal district court sitting in Virginia, under either the wrongful death act of Virginia or that of North Carolina, under which the personal representative is the only party having the right to sue. Mozingo v. Consolidated Constr. Co., 171 F. Supp. 396 (E.D. Va. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A nonresident personal representative as sole plaintiff cannot maintain an action for death by wrongful act in a federal court in Virginia against a resident of Virginia. The effect of this rule is to divest the federal courts in this state of jurisdiction in any action for death by wrongful act against a resident of Virginia, since there will be a citizen of Virginia on each side of the controversy and the requirements of diversity jurisdiction will not be satisfied.

       and, therefore, in their wrongful death action brought against a property management corporation, the corporation's plea in bar was granted with prejudice since the two-year statute of limitations had expired the day after the parents brought suit, thereby preventing joinder of a personal representative, who had been appointed 10 months after the suit was filed. The court refused to apply the law of Japan, as urged by the parents, because Japanese law did not require any additional step to qualify a person to bring suit on behalf of a decedent, which directly conflicted with Virginia law that required the appointment of a fiduciary.

     <p>
      When any nonresident infant or incapacitated person is entitled to property or money in the Commonwealth, a petition to remove the property or money to the domicile of the infant or incapacitated person may be filed by his guardian, conservator, committee, or other fiduciary lawfully appointed and qualified in the state or country of his residence, in the circuit court of the county or city in which the property or money, or some part thereof, is located. If entitlement to the property or money was acquired other than by a will or was acquired by a will that restricts the transfer out of the Commonwealth, the infant or incapacitated person, and the guardian of the infant or the conservator or other fiduciary of the incapacitated person appointed in the Commonwealth, if there is one, shall be made a party defendant to this petition. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the infant or incapacitated person who, as well as the conservator or other fiduciary, if there is one, shall answer the petition on oath. Upon a hearing of the case on its merits, or upon the petition without hearing if entitlement to the property or money was acquired by a will that does not restrict the transfer out of the Commonwealth, the court may order the fiduciary to pay and deliver to the foreign guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary, or his agent or attorney, all personal property and money in his possession belonging to the infant or incapacitated person, and authorize the foreign guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary to sue for, recover, and receive all money and personal property, including the accruing rents of his real estate, that belongs to the infant or incapacitated person in the same manner as if he were appointed a guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary of the infant or incapacitated person in the Commonwealth, and to remove the money and personal property to the state or country in which the foreign fiduciary was appointed and qualified.

In such case, the compensation for such advice and services shall not exceed the customary or prevailing amount that is charged by a fiduciary, or its affiliate or division, for providing comparable advice and services for the benefit of nonfiduciary accounts.

At its core, this case demonstrated the difference between the Virginia law determination of liability and the narrower scope of nondischargeable liability under bankruptcy law. Chavis v. Mangrum (In re Mangrum), 599 Bankr. 868, 2019 Bankr. LEXIS 1505 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2019).

      - If a bank fails to obtain an opinion in accordance with the statute, the mandate to accept the power of attorney should date back to the date it was presented and should include a mandate to honor the transaction the principal intended to make; this ensures a bank must honor an acknowledged power of attorney unless it requests a translation, certification, or opinion of counsel, and a bank that fails to do so in the time required or refuses a power of attorney before doing so proceeds at its own peril.

      - Bank's demurrer was overruled because a decedent's son stated a claim under the Power of Attorney Act since if the allegations were proven, the circuit court could mandate the bank to accept the power of attorney and honor the transaction the decedent intended to make through the son as his agent; the payment by the bank to another party would be its own loss, having taken the risk of refusing the power of attorney before receiving an opinion of counsel.

        Transfers of property.
       </b>
       - Because "sell and convey" in a power of attorney, strictly construed, was not an express grant of authority to the decedent's mother to make gifts or other transfers for inadequate consideration, the circuit court erred in holding the power of attorney expressly authorized her to give away the decedent's real and personal property; "sell and convey" contemplated a transfer be for adequate consideration and did not expressly authorize the gifts of the decedent's property granted by the mother.

        Gifts.

       - Insufficient evidence supported the conclusion that a mother's transfers were in accordance with the decedent's personal history of making lifetime gifts, and thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the mother was authorized to gift the decedent's real and personal property to herself and her surviving children; the transfers shared no similarities with the decedent's prior purported gifts, and the nature, amount, purpose, and timing of the gifts made them akin to testamentary gifts.

       - Because the cost-of-living adjustment resulted in a gift limit of approximately $14,000 per recipient, even if a decedent's mother was expressly authorized to gift the decedent's property, the circuit court erred in not applying that $14,000 per recipient limit to the over $2 million of property that the mother transferred to herself and her surviving children.

        Guardianship, legal custody distinguished.
       </b>
       - The distinction between "legal custody" and "guardianship" is a reflection of the extent of the power over and the responsibility to the child involved in each. Thus, in the Commonwealth, legal custody is the right to have physical charge of the child and generally direct the day-to-day activities of the child's life. Guardianship of the person and estate of a child, by contrast, is a broader power to have the custody of the ward and the right to take possession of the ward's estate, real and personal, and out of the proceeds of such estate provide for the ward's maintenance and education. Additionally, the legal custodian, while being required to provide the child, is not fiduciary or guarantor of the child. Rather, it is the guardian of the person and estate who carries the burden of managing the ward's estate and making good the lawful debts of his ward. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Role of guardian.
       </b>
       - Although the Code of Virginia does not define the term "guardian," implicit in the statutes is a recognition that a guardian is a person who has either the custody and control of the estate of a minor or the custody of the person of a minor, or both. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).

        Role of guardian.
       </b>
       - Although the Code of Virginia does not define the term "guardian," implicit in the statutes is a recognition that a guardian is a person who has either the custody and control of the estate of a minor or the custody of the person of a minor, or both. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).

       <b>
        Grounds for denial of guardianship award.
       </b>
       - Where it appears that the parties are attempting to accomplish some fraud or abuse of the power of guardianship, the transfer is not in the best interests of the child. Additionally, the chancellor, in determining the best interests of the child, may decline to award guardianship to any person deemed by him to be incompetent to discharge the duties of that office. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Necessity of notice prior to transfer proceeding.
       </b>
       - Reasonable notice to all interested parties is required in a proceeding involving a private petition for the transfer of guardianship of a minor child to protect the rights of such parties and to ensure the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Use of best interests analysis in transfer decision.
       </b>
       - Where the grandparents had legal custody of the child, the chancellor's consideration of a petition for transfer of guardianship is limited to a determination of whether the transfer is in the best interests of the child, and the chancellor should therefore deny such a petition only where it appears from the record that the transfer of guardianship of the person would be detrimental to the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Incorrect use of balancing test in transfer analysis.
       </b>
       - Where it is established that the petition seeking legal guardianship of the person of a minor child is unopposed by the child's natural guardian(s) and occurs subsequent to or contemporaneously with a voluntary temporary transfer of custody to the prospective legal guardian of the person of the child, the chancellor, in determining whether to grant the petition, applied an incorrect standard by balancing a potential financial benefit to the prospective legal guardian of the person against the best interests of the child.

      <p>
       <b>
        Insurer may condition coverage on obtaining guardianship.
       </b>
       - Because the statutory definition of legal custody in this Commonwealth includes the power to direct medical care, legal guardianship of the person was not a necessary legal status for grandparents who had such custody to obtain to direct such care for their granddaughter. However, the status of legal custodian does not require a non-governmental entity such as their insurance carrier to recognize their financial responsibility for her medical care. Therefore, their insurance carrier could decline to recognize the child as an insured person until the grandparents obtained the status of legal guardians of the person in order to comply with their contract. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).

       - Revocation of a wife as the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy was upheld because the evidence a daughter submitted about her father's capacity and wish to change his beneficiary was not controverted; that the father preferred to confer a benefit on his daughter, who took him in and cared for him, rather than on a wife of just a few years, who was removed as guardian for malfeasance and who had no contact with him for years, was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

       If an incapacitated person may have sufficient capacity to make a will, it follows that he or she may likewise have sufficient capacity to direct a change in his or her life insurance beneficiary designation; both are testamentary decisions that take effect at death.

       26-38, which authorizes the court to order money in the hands of any fiduciary to be invested, etc., and the statute relative to the payment of taxes on funds under the control of the court, have no application to funds in the hands of a committee or other fiduciary who is the representative of, or holds the estate of, a person under disability, such fiduciary being at all times liable for interest upon the annual balances in his hands. Said statutes only apply to such fiduciaries as represent the court and are the means by which the court holds and controls the fund in its charge. Hurt v. City of Bristol,

        Power of guardian or committee to incur obligations for necessities.

       - While the general rule is that a guardian is without power to bind a ward or his estate by contract, a guardian or committee of an incompetent may incur obligations for necessaries, such as care and support of his ward, without the prior approval of the court.

        Conversion of realty to personalty or personalty to realty through purchase of security at foreclosure sale.
       </b>
       - On appeal from a decree directing a trustee to execute and deliver to the committee of an insane person a deed to real estate sold under foreclosure proceedings at public auction, the trustee contended that the purchase of the property by the committee would have converted his ward's estate from personalty to realty, which he had no legal right to do without the sanction of a court of competent jurisdiction. The ward's personal funds had been invested by a prior committee in a bond secured by the real estate involved. The trial court, prior to the completion of the sale and transfer of the property, approved and confirmed its purchase by the committee as for the best interest of the ward. It was held that the committee was clothed with an implied power under former version of this section to bid on the property to prevent the trust estate from being deprived of its security at less than its fair value; and under all of the circumstances, the spirit of the rule requiring the consent of the court had been observed.

       Thus, where a wife procured a divorce a vinculo from her first husband, and her second husband sued for a divorce on the ground that the wife remarried within six months after she obtained the divorce a vinculo from her first husband, it was held that the evidence was sufficient to raise a presumption based on seven years' absence that the first husband was dead at the time the divorce decree was entered rendering the second marriage valid.

        Presumption rebuttable.

       - The statutory presumption of death after an absence of seven years created by this section is rebuttable. Barraud v. Barraud, 19 Va. L. Reg. 616 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       To strengthen or rebut the presumption of death created by the statute, the facts and circumstances connected with the disappearance of the absent party are admissible in evidence, since the strength of the presumption lies, not so much in the facts of his absence for the statutory period as in the cogency of the circumstances of his disappearance; such as that he was a fugitive from justice, or under a cloud as to his character, or any other facts or circumstances tending to explain his going, his motive in remaining away, or his failure to communicate with his home. Barraud v. Barraud, 19 Va. L. Reg. 616 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of death after seven years' absence is a true rebuttable presumption of law as distinguished from a presumption of fact (which is in reality merely an inference of a fact from facts proven) and from an administrative assumption of fact. Simpson v. Simpson,

       A rebuttable presumption of law is a provisional procedural assumption of a fact which is prescribed by a rule of the substantive law. It is a rule of the substantive law declaring that for procedural purposes a certain prima facie probative force will and shall, until evidence sufficient to prove the contrary is introduced, be provisionally attached to a given state of facts. That is, a certain inference shall be drawn from it, unless and until evidence sufficient to prove the contrary has been introduced. Simpson v. Simpson,

        Whether evidence is sufficient to rebut presumption is question for jury.
       </b>
       - When the presumption of death is sought to be rebutted by evidence as to the circumstances under which the missing man disappeared and under which no news has been heard of him, the question whether such evidence is sufficient to rebut the presumption of death prescribed by this section is a question of fact for the jury.

        Grant of letters of administration on estate of a living person as if he were dead is absolutely void,
       </b>
       and if it be conceded that the legislature intended by this section to authorize the courts to grant administration upon the estate of a person who was once a resident of the State and has been absent therefrom and unheard from for more than seven years, irrespective of his death, the statute is a plain violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A statute which authorizes the taking of an absentee's property and administering it when he is alive, without his knowledge or consent, and in a proceeding to which he is not a party, and of which he has no notice, is a clear violation of the "due process" clause of said amendment.
