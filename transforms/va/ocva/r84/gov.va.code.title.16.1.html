Acts 2014, cc. 812 and 822, cl. 4 provides: "That the provisions of this act reducing the number of authorized judgeships in the General District Court of the Fifth Judicial District shall become effective upon the death, resignation, or retirement on or after January 1, 2014, of any judge of that court."

     When contracts arising from violation of subsection (c) void.

    - The General Assembly intended that sanctions under
    
     §
    
    16.1-69.22 and under lawyer disciplinary procedures constitute adequate penalties for violation of subsection (c) of this section. Therefore, it is manifest the legislature did not intend that contracts arising from a bare violation of subsection (c) of this section be void, unless, however, a litigant has been prejudiced by the violation.

When reasonably necessary, the chief district judge may designate a substitute judge from another district within the Commonwealth. The committee on district courts may adopt policies and procedures governing the utilization of substitute judges. In such event, those policies and procedures will, where applicable, control. While acting as judge, a substitute judge shall perform the same duties, exercise the same power and authority, and be subject to the same obligations as prescribed herein for the judge.

Closing of the clerk's office pursuant to this subsection shall have the same effect as provided in subsection B of § 1-210. In determining whether to close because of a threat to the health or safety of the general public, the chief judge or the presiding judge of the district court shall coordinate with the chief judge or presiding judge of the circuit court so that, where possible and appropriate, both the circuit and district courts take the same action. He shall determine the times each such court shall be held for the trial of civil, criminal or traffic matters and cases. He shall determine whether, in the case of district courts in counties, court shall be held at any place or places in addition to the county seat or other place expressly authorized by statute. He shall determine the office hours and arrange a vacation schedule of the judges within his district, in order to ensure the availability of a judge or judges to the public at normal times of business. A schedule of the times and places at which court is held shall be filed with the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court and kept posted at the courthouse, and in any county also at any such other place or places where court may be held, and the clerk shall make such schedules available to the public upon request.

       In addition to any other fee prescribed by this section, a fee of $35 shall be taxed as costs whenever a defendant fails to appear, unless, after a hearing requested by such person, good cause is shown for such failure to appear. No defendant with multiple charges arising from a single incident shall be taxed the applicable fixed fee provided in subsection B, C, or D more than once for a single appearance or trial in absence related to that incident. However, when a defendant who has multiple charges arising from the same incident and who has been assessed a fixed fee for one of those charges is later convicted of another charge that arises from that same incident and that has a higher fixed fee, he shall be assessed the difference between the fixed fee earlier assessed and the higher fixed fee.

       A defendant with charges which arise from separate incidents shall be taxed a fee for each incident even if the charges from the multiple incidents are disposed of in a single appearance or trial in absence.

      <p>
       In addition to the fixed fees assessed pursuant to this section, in the appropriate cases, the clerk shall also assess any costs otherwise specifically provided by statute.

      <p>
       Fees in civil cases for services performed by the judges or clerks of general district courts or magistrates in the event any such services are performed by magistrates in civil cases shall be as provided in this section, and, unless otherwise provided, shall be included in the taxed costs and shall not be refundable, except in case of error or as herein provided.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       For all court and magistrate services in each distress, detinue, interrogatory summons, unlawful detainer, civil warrant, notice of motion, garnishment, attachment issued, or other civil proceeding, the fee shall be $36. No such fee shall be collected (i) in any tax case instituted by any county, city or town or (ii) in any case instituted by a school board for collection of overdue book rental fees. Of the fees collected under this section, $10 of each such fee collected shall be apportioned to the Courts Technology Fund established under § 17.1-132.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The judge or clerk shall collect the foregoing fee at the time of issuing process. Any magistrate or other issuing officer shall collect the foregoing fee at the time of issuing process, and shall remit the entire fee promptly to the court to which such process is returnable, or to its clerk. When no service of process is had on a defendant named in any civil process other than a notice of motion for judgment, such process may be reissued once by the court or clerk at the court's direction by changing the return day of such process, for which service by the court or clerk there shall be no charge; however, reissuance of such process shall be within three months after the original return day.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk of any district court may charge a fee for making a copy of any paper of record to go out of his office which is not otherwise specifically provided for. The amount of this fee shall be set in the discretion of the clerk but shall not exceed $1 for the first two pages and $.50 for each page thereafter.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The fees prescribed in this section shall be the only fees charged in civil cases for services performed by such judges and clerks, and when the services referred to herein are performed by magistrates such fees shall be the only fees charged by such magistrates for the prescribed services.

      <p>
       Except as provided in Article 5 (§ 16.1-122.1 et seq.), each general district court shall have, within the limits of the territory it serves, civil jurisdiction as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t16.1c06a02s16.1-77ol11">
        Exclusive original jurisdiction of (i) any claim to specific personal property or to any debt, fine or other money, or to damages for breach of contract or for injury done to property, real or personal, when the amount of such claim does not exceed $4,500, exclusive of interest and any attorney fees, and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts having jurisdiction in such territory of any such claim when the amount thereof exceeds $4,500 but does not exceed $25,000, exclusive of interest and any attorney fees, and (ii) any action for injury to person, regardless of theory, and any action for wrongful death as provided for in Article 5 (§ 8.01-50 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 when the amount of such claim does not exceed $4,500, exclusive of interest and any attorney fees, and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts having jurisdiction in such territory of any such claim when the amount thereof exceeds $4,500 but does not exceed $50,000, exclusive of interest and any attorney fees. However, the jurisdictional limit shall not apply with respect to distress warrants under the provisions of § 8.01-130.4, cases involving liquidated damages for violations of vehicle weight limits pursuant to § 46.2-1135, nor cases involving forfeiture of a bond pursuant to § 19.2-143. While a matter is pending in a general district court, upon motion of the plaintiff seeking to increase the amount of the claim, the court shall order transfer of the matter to the circuit court that has jurisdiction over the amended amount of the claim without requiring that the case first be dismissed or that the plaintiff suffer a nonsuit, and the tolling of the applicable statutes of limitations governing the pending matter shall be unaffected by the transfer. Except for good cause shown, no such order of transfer shall issue unless the motion to amend and transfer is made at least 10 days before trial. The plaintiff shall pay filing and other fees as otherwise provided by law to the clerk of the court to which the case is transferred, and such clerk shall process the claim as if it were a new civil action. The plaintiff shall prepare and present the order of transfer to the transferring court for entry, after which time the case shall be removed from the pending docket of the transferring court and the order of transfer placed among its records. The plaintiff shall provide a certified copy of the transfer order to the receiving court.

        Jurisdiction to try and decide suits in interpleader involving personal or real property where the amount of money or value of the property is not more than the maximum jurisdictional limits of the general district court.

The action shall be brought in accordance with the procedures for interpleader as set forth in § 8.01-364. However, the general district court shall not have any power to issue injunctions. Actions in interpleader may be brought by either the stakeholder or any of the claimants. The initial pleading shall be either by motion for judgment, by warrant in debt, or by other uniform court form established by the Supreme Court of Virginia. The initial pleading shall briefly set forth the circumstances of the claim and shall name as defendant all parties in interest who are not parties plaintiff.

     Jurisdiction limited by statute.
    </b>
    - The judicial authority of a justice of the peace [now general district court judge] is entirely statutory. He can exercise only such jurisdiction as is expressly conferred on him. City of Richmond v. Sutherland, <cite class="va_code">114 Va. 688</cite>, 77 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 470</cite> (1913); Epperty v. Holley, 3 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 27 (1917); Copperthite Pie Corp. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A trial justice (appointed under Chapter 2 of former Title 16, now general district court judge) has limited jurisdiction and, since he derives all his jurisdictional authority from statute, he can only exercise such jurisdiction as is expressly conferred upon him. Addison v. Salyer, <cite class="va_code">185 Va. 644</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 260 (1946).

        A trial justice [now general district court judge] has no jurisdiction in cases involving title to real property. Addison v. Salyer, <cite class="va_code">185 Va. 644</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 260 (1946), decided under former statute corresponding to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it appeared from the evidence before the trial justice that the plaintiff in a petition for attachment based his claim upon the loss of acreage in, and an inaccurate description of, the tract of land described in his deed from defendants, it became the duty of the trial justice to dismiss the case. Addison v. Salyer, <cite class="va_code">185 Va. 644</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 260 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in granting a foreclosure purchaser's motion for summary judgment and awarding it possession of the borrowers' property in the purchaser's unlawful detainer action because the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the general district court and the general district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case where the borrowers' allegations raised a bona fide question of title that, if proved, could set aside the foreclosure.

     Amount of debt in controversy.

        <b>
     Judgment as res judicata.
    </b>
    - The civil and police court [now general district court] is concededly one of limited jurisdiction and not a court of record. However, where both parties invoked its jurisdiction, and the claims for property damage asserted by each of them were cognizable in that court, its final judgment on the merits may be invoked by a plea of res judicata or estoppel of record as a bar to further litigation between the same parties of the identical issues litigated and decided in that court, and there is no merit to the contention that the former judgment cannot be a bar because rendered by an inferior court. Petrus v. Robbins, <cite class="va_code">196 Va. 322</cite>, 83 S.E.2d 408 (1954), decided under former

     Prohibition against justice exceeding jurisdiction; collateral attack on judgments.
    </b>
    - While a writ of prohibition will be awarded to prevent a justice of the peace [now general district court judge] from taking jurisdiction of a debt in excess of $100.00 (now $1,000), which has been split up into notes each less than all of which are due, and for which separate warrants are being prosecuted before him, yet where such warrants have proceeded to judgment before the justice, with the consent or acquiescence of the defendant, such judgments cannot be thereafter collaterally assailed by third persons. This result does not in any degree impinge upon the maxim that consent cannot give jurisdiction, as the justice had jurisdiction over the amount represented in each judgment. Adams v. Jennings, <cite class="va_code">103 Va. 579</cite>, 49 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 982</cite> (1905).

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Every warrant in debt, counter claim, or third party claim in a medical malpractice action, at the time the plaintiff requests service of process upon a defendant, or requests a defendant to accept service of process, shall be deemed a certification that the plaintiff has obtained from an expert whom the plaintiff reasonably believes would qualify as an expert witness pursuant to subsection A of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-581.20" target="_blank">§ 8.01-581.20</a></cite> a written opinion signed by the expert witness that, based upon a reasonable understanding of the facts, the defendant for whom service of process has been requested deviated from the applicable standard of care and the deviation was a proximate cause of the injuries claimed. This certification is not necessary if the plaintiff, in good faith, alleges a medical malpractice action that asserts a theory of liability where expert testimony is unnecessary because the alleged act of negligence clearly lies within the range of the jury's common knowledge and experience.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The certifying expert shall not be required to be an expert witness expected to testify at trial nor shall any defendant be entitled to discover the identity or qualifications of the certifying expert or the nature of the certifying expert opinions. Should the certifying expert be identified as an expert expected to testify at trial, the opinions and bases therefor shall be discoverable pursuant to Rule 4:1 of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia with the exception of the expert's status as a certifying expert.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon written request of any defendant, the plaintiff shall, within 10 business days after receipt of such request, provide the defendant with a certification form which affirms that the plaintiff had obtained the necessary certifying expert opinion at the time service was requested or affirms that the plaintiff did not need to obtain a certifying expert opinion. The court, upon good cause shown, may conduct an in camera review of the certifying expert opinion obtained by the plaintiff as the court may deem appropriate. If the plaintiff did not obtain a necessary certifying expert opinion at the time the plaintiff requested service of process on a defendant, the court shall impose sanctions according to the provisions of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-271.1" target="_blank">§ 8.01-271.1</a></cite> and may dismiss the case with prejudice.

If such health care provider or custodian is not subject to subpoena for cross-examination in court or by a deposition, then the court shall allow a reasonable opportunity for the party seeking the subpoena for such health care provider or custodian to obtain his testimony as the ends of justice may require. The plaintiff may only present evidence pursuant to this section in circuit court if he has not requested an amount in excess of the ad damnum in the motion for judgment filed in the general district court.

      </h3>
      <p>
       A judge or clerk of a district court may issue a subpoena duces tecum pursuant to the terms of Rule 4:9A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia except that such subpoena may be directed to a party to the case as well as to a person who is not a party.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subpoenas duces tecum for medical records issued by an attorney shall be subject to the provisions of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-413" target="_blank">§§ 8.01-413</a></cite> and 32.1-127.1:03 except that no separate fee for issuance shall be imposed.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A subpoena duces tecum may also be issued by an attorney-at-law who is an active member of the Virginia State Bar at the time of issuance, as an officer of the court. Any such subpoena duces tecum shall be on a form approved by the Committee on District Courts, signed by the attorney as if a pleading and shall include the attorney's address. A copy, together with the attorney's certificate of service pursuant to Rule 1:12, shall be mailed or delivered to the clerk's office of the court in which the case is pending on the day of issuance by the attorney. The law governing subpoenas duces tecum issued by a clerk shall apply mutatis mutandis, except that attorneys may not issue subpoenas duces tecum in those cases in which they may not issue a summons as provided in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-407" target="_blank">§ 8.01-407</a></cite>. A sheriff shall not be required to serve an attorney-issued subpoena that is not issued at least five business days prior to the date production of evidence is desired. When an attorney-at-law transmits one or more subpoenas duces tecum to a sheriff to be served in his jurisdiction, the provisions in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-407" target="_blank">§ 8.01-407</a></cite> regarding such transmittals shall apply.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the time for compliance with a subpoena duces tecum issued by an attorney is less than 14 days after service of the subpoena, the person to whom it is directed may serve upon the party issuing the subpoena a written objection setting forth any grounds upon which such production, inspection or testing should not be had. If objection is made, the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and served shall not be entitled to the requested production, inspection or testing, except pursuant to an order of the court, but may, upon notice to the person to whom the subpoena was directed, move for an order to compel production, inspection or testing. Upon such timely motion, the court may quash, modify or sustain the subpoena.

         District court final order would satisfy requirements for written decision.
        </b>
        - In an eviction proceeding, as a discretionary matter, a general district court in Virginia could provide the tenant discovery by ordering a bill of particulars, and issue subpoenas duces tecum, and has the power to issue a final order that would satisfy the requirements for a written decision. Kennedy v. Block, 784 F.2d 1220 (4th Cir. 1986).

       Whenever a fieri facias has been issued upon a judgment rendered in a general district court the judge or clerk of the court may issue the summons provided for in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-506" target="_blank">§ 8.01-506</a></cite>. In such case the judge of the general district court shall have all of the powers and authority respecting interrogatories conferred by §<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-506" target="_blank">§ 8.01-506</a></cite> to<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-510" target="_blank"> 8.01-510</a></cite> upon any court or judge mentioned therein. The commissioner before whom any person is required to appear by such summons shall have the same powers and authority as if such summons had been issued under § 8.01-506. All interrogatories, answers, reports and other proceedings under such summons, and also all money, evidences of indebtedness and other security in the hands of an officer which are directed by any section of Chapter 18 (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-466" target="_blank">§ 8.01-466</a></cite> et seq.) of Title 8.01 to be returned or delivered to such court or judge, or to the clerk's office of such court, shall, when the summons was issued by a judge of a general district court be returned or delivered in like manner to the court from which the summons issued.

       From any order of the judge of the general district court which involves the disposition of any money or property exceeding the sum of fifty dollars in value, exclusive of interest, there shall be an appeal in the same manner and upon the same conditions as in appeals from judgments rendered in civil matters in general district courts.

         Continuance of interrogatory hearing for status.
        </b>
        - Where debtor filed a Chapter 7 petition on the morning of a hearing on interrogatories that were served on her for discovery in aid of execution of Virginia state court judgment, continuing her interrogatories hearing for status violated the automatic stay, as there was no question that creditor and its attorney had actual notice of her bankruptcy filing. Even if creditor's attorney did not request continuance for status, she should have dismissed debtor's interrogatories as soon as she learned of the bankruptcy filing, thus obviating need for a continuance by the state court.

     Appeal of right generally.

    - Section
    
     §
    
    16.1-106 does not require the appealing party to appeal every adverse ruling of the general district court but, rather, provides an appeal of right for any order entered or judgment rendered. Robert &amp; Bertha Robinson Family, LLC v. Allen, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 130</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 48, 2018 Va. LEXIS 15 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of Virginia holds that the appeal of right belongs to the party applying for the same. When the general district court enters a final, appealable judgment on claims pleaded in a warrant, summons, or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:4(a); a counterclaim or cross-claim, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:3(a); or a third-party civil warrant or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:10(a), any party seeking on appeal to change or modify an unfavorable disposition of a claim asserted by or against him must file a notice of appeal. The failure to do so will leave the general district court's judgment on the claim intact and subject to res judicata principles. Robert &amp; Bertha Robinson Family, LLC v. Allen, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 130</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 48, 2018 Va. LEXIS 15 (2018).

        <b>
     Ruling on motion requesting a new trial not appealable under this section.
    </b>
    - Circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear tenant's appeal in unlawful detainer action from denial of her motion requesting a new trial because the decision denying the motion was not a final order or judgment, as it did not dispose of the merits of the unlawful detainer summons, and therefore was not "any order entered or judgment rendered" as required by this section.

       <p>
        <b>
     Ruling on motion to set aside verdict not a final judgment.
    </b>
    - Trial court properly granted the prevailing parties motion to dismiss the losing parties appeal from the general district court, as the losing parties motion to set aside was not a final judgment from which an appeal could be taken. Architectural Stone, LLC v. Wolcott Ctr., LLC, <cite class="va_code">274 Va. 519</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 670, 2007 Va. LEXIS 107 (2007).

        <b>
     Jurisdictional amount.
    </b>
    - Under this section costs are not to be computed as a part of the matter in controversy in determining the right of appeal. Shafer v. C &amp; O R.R., 2 Va. Dec. 252, 23 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 221</cite> (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section no appeal lies from a judgment for $10.00 (now $50.00) and costs, costs being no part of the controversy. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Clark, <cite class="va_code">92 Va. 118</cite>, 22 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 867</cite> (1895).

       <p>
        <b>
     Judgment involving constitutionality of statute.
    </b>
    - The language of this section is broad enough to cover the right of appeal to the circuit court from a judgment involving the constitutionality of a statute. Southern Ry. v. Hill, <cite class="va_code">106 Va. 501</cite>, 56 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 278</cite> (1907).

       <p>
        <b>
     Appeal on statute's constitutionality does not lie if previously decided by Supreme Court.
    </b>
    - Where the sole ground for an appeal is the constitutionality of a statute, the validity of which has been settled by former decisions of the Supreme Court, an appeal will not be entertained. This is the rule even if the constitutional objections are not precisely the same ones previously adjudicated. Myers v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 409</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 414 (1963).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Abandoned counterclaim not revived in trial de novo of plaintiff's claim.
    </b>
    - Defendant's inaction and failure to seek a definitive ruling when the district court failed, apparently through inadvertence, to rule upon defendant's counterclaim was an abandonment of the claim, and the circuit court properly refused to allow it to be revived in a trial de novo on plaintiff's claim. K-B Corp. v. Gallagher, <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 381</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 183 (1977).

       <p>
        <b>
     Consideration of pleadings.
    </b>

Such bond shall be posted within 30 days from the date of judgment, except for an appeal from the judgment of a general district court on an unlawful detainer pursuant to § 8.01-129.

        <b>
     Generally.
    </b>
    - Supreme Court of Virginia holds that the appeal of right belongs to the party applying for the same. When the general district court enters a final, appealable judgment on claims pleaded in a warrant, summons, or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:4(a); a counterclaim or cross-claim, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:3(a); or a third-party civil warrant or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:10(a), any party seeking on appeal to change or modify an unfavorable disposition of a claim asserted by or against him must file a notice of appeal. The failure to do so will leave the general district court's judgment on the claim intact and subject to res judicata principles. Robert &amp; Bertha Robinson Family, LLC v. Allen, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 130</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 48, 2018 Va. LEXIS 15 (2018).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Statutory requirements must be observed.
    </b>
    - The right of appeal is statutory and the statutory procedural prerequisites must be observed. Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 538</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Though substantial compliance is sufficient.
    </b>
    - A substantial compliance with the statutory requirements is all that is necessary. Brooks v. Epperson, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 37</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 787</cite> (1935).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The words "or someone for him" mean
    </b>
    that the bond called for by this section may be given by someone other than the party taking the appeal, provided the bond is conditioned as required by the statute and carries sufficient surety. Combined Ins. Co. of Am. v. Mundy, <cite class="va_code">210 Va. 3</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 127 (1969).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The requirements for appeal bonds are mandatory,
    </b>
    and the exercise of appellate jurisdiction confined to the provisions of the written law. Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 538</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944), holding that provision requiring bond was not waived.
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     And a surety is necessary.
    </b>
    - In civil appeals from civil and police justices the appeal bond must be with surety. Brooks v. Epperson, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 37</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 787</cite> (1935), decided under former statute corresponding to this section.
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Hence, a deposit of cash is not a substantial compliance with this section
    </b>
    and a certified check is not "surety" within the meaning of the section. Brooks v. Epperson, <cite class="va_code">164 Va. 37</cite>, 178 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 787</cite> (1935) (decided under former statute), wherein the court dealt with the check as cash. However, now a cash deposit may be made in lieu of giving bond. See
    
     §
    
    16.1-108.
    <br/>

       </p>
       <p>
        It is one thing for the State to excuse indigents from payment of fees and costs which are essentially state interests; it is another thing for the State to excuse indigents from posting bonds designed to protect the judgment rights of successful litigants.

        16.1-136 et seq. in no way abrogates the mandatory provisions of this section, which requires a bond in an appeal of a civil case. Scheer v. Isaacs, 10 Va. App. 338, 392 S.E.2d 201 (1990).

     Insufficient bond of corporation.
    </b>
    - Defendant corporation gave what it thought was an appeal bond under this section with surety approved by the trial justice (now district court judge). The bond was executed by the president of the corporation, but the corporate seal was not affixed to the instrument. It was contended that there was a substantial compliance with this section, because the executed instrument provided ample security for the payment of any judgment in plaintiff's favor, in that defendant was bound by its written obligation and its surety could not, under other sections of the Code, deny its liability. It was held that there was no merit in the contention. Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, <cite class="va_code">182 Va. 538</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 406 (1944).

        <b>
     Effect of failure to require appeal bond.
    </b>
    - That it is the duty of a justice of the peace (now district court judge) before allowing an appeal, to require an appeal bond may be conceded, but his omission to require such bond does not oust the circuit court of its jurisdiction. Under
    
     §
    
    16.1-114.1, it is the duty of the court to correct the omission of the justice and require the execution of the bond, and upon due execution thereof to proceed with the trial of the case according to the principles of law and equity.

         Civil contempt of court did not alter nature of relief.
        </b>
        - Where judgment was for arrearages in child support payments established by the terms of a previously-entered property settlement agreement, and where husband filed his notice of appeal with the circuit court but posted no appeal bond, upon the expiration of 30 days, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal; the fact that husband also was found in civil contempt of court, and a sanction was imposed, did not alter the fundamental nature of the relief sought by wife; the case was treated as a civil proceeding in the juvenile and domestic relations court and the appeal to the circuit court was, therefore, civil in nature. Scheer v. Isaacs, 10 Va. App. 338, 392 S.E.2d 201 (1990).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No appeal bond was required by this section
        </b>
        where the juvenile and domestic relations proceeding from which defendant appealed was his motion to quash the department's withholding order and his motion to be allowed credit for Social Security benefits paid to his children and the order did not establish a support arrearage or enter judgment for an arrearage.

       <p>
        <b>
     Writ tax provisions mandatory.
    </b>
    - The provisions of the second paragraph of this section are mandatory, not merely directory. Unless the writ tax is paid to the district court clerk within 30 days from the judgment date, the district court has no authority to transmit the case to the circuit court. Thus, the intended appeal is not perfected and the circuit court does not obtain jurisdiction. Hurst v. Ballard, <cite class="va_code">230 Va. 365</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 284 (1985).

        <b>
     Timely payment of writ tax is jurisdictional.

    of whose pendency the defendant is already aware. The notice is required by this section to be served only upon the appellee or his attorney. The appellee often is the plaintiff, who could hardly be expected to respond to his own civil warrant or other similar pleading. No particular form is prescribed for the notice; the clerk is required merely to give notice that "such an appeal has been docketed in his office." Overnite Transp. Co. v.

    - A notice that an appeal has been docketed is not, by name, nature, or form, equivalent or even similar to a notice of motion for judgment. A notice of motion for judgment is notice to the defendant of a new action brought against him. In prescribed form, the notice specifically calls upon him timely to respond or suffer the enunciated danger of default. Overnite Transp. Co. v.

         Transmission of record to circuit court.
        </b>
        - By failing to transmit the case papers to the circuit court, the general district court (GDC) acted in derogation of strong policy reasons favoring certainty of results in judicial proceedings because its action called into question the finality of the judgment in the absence of a ruling from the circuit court; the GDC in effect delayed timely adjudication of the appeal de novo by declining to perform a ministerial act, namely the forwarding of its case papers to the circuit court. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020).

       <p>
        It is not the transmission of the case papers that creates the jurisdiction of the circuit court, but rather the filing of the notice of appeal. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020).

        <b>
         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - When a lower court procedurally impedes an appeal by failing to transmit its case papers to the upper court under the mistaken belief the circuit court does not have jurisdiction and the appellant has taken all steps in the lower court properly to invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court, then, in effect, the upper court has already acquired jurisdiction over the appeal. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus proceeding was unnecessary because the circuit court possessed jurisdiction over the cause, and merely did not have the general district court's (GDC) case papers; while the GDC did not transmit the relevant case papers to the circuit court, the circuit court acquired jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of the appeal by the filing of the notice of appeal in the GDC. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a disputed issue of first impression arises regarding the circuit court's jurisdiction, particularly interpretation of a new statutory provision, due process and prudence suggest the general district court clerk should transmit the case papers to the upper court to permit it to determine the issue of its jurisdiction; this concept of erring on the side of affording litigants meaningful opportunity to be heard should be of particular focus when the consequences of error could be dire. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020).

         General district court divested of jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Case was properly before the circuit court because the general district court having been divested of jurisdiction by virtue of a tenant's appeal, the obtaining of the case papers from the GDC became the province of the circuit court's inherent power to exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate those causes properly entrusted to the forum; the Calendar Control Judge thus appropriately set a hearing to consider whether the bond set by the GDC judge was required to perfect the appeal.

      </h3>
      <p>
       Every such appeal shall be tried by the court in a summary way, or, if the amount in controversy exceeds fifty dollars, by a jury if either party requires it. All legal evidence produced by either party shall be heard, whether or not it was produced before the court from which the appeal is taken. If judgment is recovered by the appellee, execution shall issue against the principal and his surety, jointly or separately, for the amount of the judgment, including interests and costs, with damages on the aggregate at the rate of ten percent annually, from the date of that judgment until payment, and for the costs of the appeal; and the execution shall be endorsed "No security is to be taken." If the decision is reversed, the party substantially prevailing shall recover his costs and the order or judgment shall be made or given as ought to have been made or given by the judge of the court from which the appeal was taken. When the appeal is from an order or judgment under §§ 16.1-119 through 16.1-121, the court shall enter such judgment respecting the property, the expense of keeping it, and any injury done to it, as may be equitable among the parties.

    - An appeal from the trial justice, properly perfected, transfers the entire record to the circuit court for a retrial as though originally brought therein.

     Right to jury trial not improperly denied where plaintiff did not follow procedure.

    - Dismissal of suit, which complained only of the denial of a trial by jury and asserted a collusion by defendants to deny him one, was proper, where plaintiff's own actions in bringing suit in the general district court rather than the circuit court deprived him of a trial by jury. Had he originally brought his personal injury claim in circuit court, as he was entitled to by

     Petty offenses not requiring jury trial.
    </b>
    - Notwithstanding the broad language of the Virginia Constitution, there are many petty offenses against statutes or municipal ordinances which are triable without a jury, because they were so triable when the Constitution was adopted, and the right of trial by jury which is secured is the right as it existed at the time the Constitution was adopted. This was decided in Ex parte Marx, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 40</cite>, 9 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 475</cite> (1889), and such is the settled law on the subject. Ragsdale v.

       Upon the trial of a warrant, the court may, upon its own motion or upon the request either of the attorney for the prosecution or for the accused, amend the form of the warrant in any respect in which it appears to be defective. But when the warrant is so defective in form that it does not substantially appear from the same what is the offense with which the accused is charged, or even when it is not so seriously defective, the judge of the court having examined on oath the original complainant, if there be one, or if he sees good reason to believe that an offense has been committed, then without examination of witnesses, may issue under his own hand his warrant reciting the offense and requiring the defendant in the original warrant to be arrested and brought before him. Upon the arrest of the defendant on the new warrant and his production or appearance in court the trial shall proceed upon the new warrant. When there is an amendment of the original warrant the trial shall proceed on the amended warrant. But whether the warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued, the court before proceeding to trial on the same may grant a continuance to the prosecution or to the defendant upon such terms as to costs as may be proper under the circumstances of the case; provided, however, that if the warrant be amended or if a new warrant be issued after any evidence has been heard, the accused shall be entitled to a continuance as a matter of right.

     Amendment did not render warrant defective.
    </b>
    - Arrest warrant issued was not defective as a result of having been amended sometime prior to a trial de novo in the lower appellate court, where the dates of the offense were amended, as the same particularity was not required in warrants of arrest as was required in formal indictments; pursuant to

        - Amendment to a warrant could not change the nature and character of the offense originally charged; a trial court erred when, after hearing the evidence and without the agreement of the parties or the request of either, sua sponte, amended a DUI warrant to reckless driving and convicted defendant, since reckless driving was not a lesser included offense of DUI.

      <p>
       In any criminal or traffic case in a court not of record, if the court rules that a statute or local ordinance is unconstitutional, it shall upon motion of the Commonwealth, or the locality if a local ordinance is the subject of the ruling, stay the proceedings and issue a written statement of its findings of law and relevant facts, if any, in support of its ruling and shall transmit the case, together with all papers, documents, and evidence connected therewith, to the circuit court for a determination of constitutionality. Either party may file a brief with the circuit court. Either party may request oral argument before the circuit court. The circuit court shall give the issue priority on its docket. If the circuit court rules that the statute or local ordinance is unconstitutional, the Commonwealth or the locality may appeal such interlocutory order to the Court of Appeals and thereafter to the Supreme Court; however, if the circuit court rules that the statute or local ordinance is constitutional, the circuit court shall remand the case to the court not of record for trial consistent with the ruling of the circuit court.

    - In a case in which a circuit court quashed defendant's appeal of a revocation of suspension of his sentence for contributing to the delinquency of a minor based on an excessive number of unexcused school absences of one of his four minor children, from the juvenile and domestic relations district court (juvenile court) because it was untimely, the circuit court incorrectly determined that the December 17, 2008, order was a final order by the juvenile court and that his appeal within ten days after entry of the February 11, 2009, order was untimely. Not until the juvenile court heard additional evidence on February 11, 2009, regarding compliance with the conditions of suspension did it make a final, appealable determination regarding whether to impose the previously suspended 30-day sentence or to re-suspend some or all of that time, and defendant's appeal was filed on the same day.

       <p>
        Defendant's appeal of his misdemeanor conviction in the general district court for a de novo trial in the circuit court fell precisely within the class of cases and controversies that the statutes granted the circuit court authority to adjudicate, and the question of whether his notice of appeal was timely filed concerned the circuit court's active jurisdiction, which could be waived if not preserved. Because defendant failed to preserve this argument in circuit court, it could not be addressed on appeal. Breznick v. Commonwealth, No. 0982-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va.

     Termination of district court's jurisdiction following appeal to circuit court.
    </b>
    - Where a case is brought in the circuit court on appeal from the district court, a de novo hearing on the merits must commence before the district court's jurisdiction to reopen the case is terminated; accordingly, where a defendant had noted his appeal to the circuit court and, at the only hearing in that court, the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial and the case was continued, such incidents did not rise to the dignity of a de novo hearing on the merits, the district court retained jurisdiction to reopen its judgment and the defendant could withdraw his appeal to the circuit court.

         Applicability.
        </b>
        - Statutory authority of
        §
        16.1-133.1 applies only to convictions not matters rendered nolle prosequi; while the district court may retain its revisory power over criminal sentences within the time frame allotted by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, it is clear the General Assembly did not statutorily authorize the district court, on application of the Commonwealth, to vacate the nolle prosequi once entered. Commonwealth v.

         Construction.
        </b>
        - While the statute does elongate the time of the revisory power of such courts, it does so only when application is made by the defendant; In addition, in excluding the Commonwealth from the ability to reopen cases, the statute appears to enjoin completely the Commonwealth from revisiting a judgment of conviction to exact an altered punishment. Commonwealth v. Darab, 99 Va. Cir. 138, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 2, 2018).

       <p>
        <b>
         Double jeopardy.
        </b>
        - Because the Commonwealth terminated a prosecution after jeopardy had attached, the nolle prosequi acted as an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, and, therefore, the cause had to be dismissed with finality. Commonwealth v. Darab, 99 Va. Cir. 138, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 2, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Litigants are entitled to the certainty that a nolle prosequi is not a mere fleeting grant of a temporary end of a prosecution easily reversed by a judge upon the whim of the moment, but instead triggers the statutory due process rights attendant to bringing charges anew. Commonwealth v. Darab, 99 Va. Cir. 138, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 2, 2018).

        <b>
         District court abused its discretion in vacating nolle prosequi order.
        </b>
        - District court's action of taking the uninvited initiative to cause the nolle prosequi to be vacated and proceeding to trial without the formal recharging of the offense constituted an abuse of discretion because it never announced in reversing its original ruling why its previous judgment was in error; the district court acted in a manner that could be interpreted as crossing the line between prosecuting and judging the case. Commonwealth v. Darab, 99 Va. Cir. 138, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 2, 2018).

         Statute does not apply to matters rendered nolle prosequi.

        - Statutory authority applies only to convictions not matters rendered nolle prosequi; while the district court may retain its revisory power over criminal sentences within the time frame allotted by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, it is clear the General Assembly did not statutorily authorize the district court, on application of the Commonwealth, to vacate the nolle prosequi once entered. Commonwealth v.

         Court cannot reacquire jurisdiction by vacating nolle prosequi order.
        </b>
        - District court could not vacate its written grant of a nolle prosequi motion because it divested itself of jurisdiction over defendant and thus, could not reacquire the same by vacating its divesting order; to re-institute the jurisdiction of the district court over defendant, due process required the reinstatement of the case through recharging, assuming double jeopardy was of no bar.

    - Circuit court committed clear error in denying a mother her right to a de novo appeal of an order awarding a father custody of the parties' child because the circuit court considered the transcript of the juvenile and domestic relations district court hearing on the matter and pronounced that its ruling would be the same unless the mother presented different evidence; the circuit court improperly shifted the burden of production and persuasion from the father to the mother by requiring the mother to present new or different evidence and imposed an award of attorney's fees as a punitive measure to punish the mother for pursuing her right to a trial de novo.

          Distinction between appeal and divestiture of further jurisdiction in juvenile court.
         </b>
         - Under the statutory scheme this distinction between an appeal under this section and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of subsection A of
         §
         16.1-244 is intentional and consistent with and conducive to the best interests of children who are the subjects of custody disputes between their natural parents, the protection of parental rights, and, less significantly, with the notion of judicial economy. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         In an appeal to the circuit court, the "advantage" granted to the noncustodial parent is simply the avoidance of the additional burden of proof imposed by the change in circumstance test; in the de novo appeal, the issue is simply what is in the best interests of the child. Accordingly, the procedural distinction between an appeal under this section and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of subsection A of
         §
         16.1-244 is significant and perhaps controlling in most cases. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).

     De novo review precludes issues concerning notice provided by JDR court.

     §
    
    16.1-136. Any issues concerning the notice provided by the JDR court were moot. Harris v. Burd,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 393</cite> (Aug. 22, 2006).

     Impartial de novo standard of review not denied.

    - Trial court did not deny a mother an impartial de novo standard of review on appeal from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court because although the trial court reviewed the JDR court's opinion in issuing its pendente lite order, the trial court stated that it reached its own conclusions; from the trial court's letter opinion, and the fact that the pendente lite hearing lasted for two days, it was apparent that the mother was allowed to put on evidence, and in addition, the final hearing took place over two days, with one day devoted to custody issues.

    - Record belied a parent's assertion that the trial court did not afford the parent a trial de novo and shifted the burden of going forward with evidence to the parent as a result of its admission of orders terminating the parent's residual parental rights. To the contrary, the record showed that the trial court admitted the orders, but limited their use to show the procedural history of the case, not the substantive history. Chappell v.

      <p>
       Upon the trial of the warrant on appeal the court may, upon its own motion or upon the request either of the attorney for the prosecution or for the accused, amend the form of the warrant in any respect in which it appears to be defective. But when the warrant is so defective in form that it does not substantially appear from the same what is the offense with which the accused is charged, or even when it is not so seriously defective, the judge of the court having examined on oath the original complainant, if there be one, or if he sees good reason to believe that an offense has been committed, then without examination of witnesses, may issue under his own hand his warrant reciting the offense and requiring the defendant in the original warrant to be arrested and brought before him. Upon the arrest of the defendant on the new warrant and his production or appearance in court the trial shall proceed upon the new warrant. When there is an amendment of the original warrant the trial shall proceed on the amended warrant. But whether the warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued, the court before proceeding to trial on the same may grant a continuance to the prosecution or to the defendant upon such terms as to costs as may be proper under the circumstances of the case; provided, however, that if the warrant be amended or if a new warrant be issued after any evidence has been heard, the accused shall be entitled to a continuance as a matter of right.

      </p>
      <p>
       When a warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued the costs already accrued shall be taxed against the defendant, if he is ultimately convicted, as a part of the costs arising under the new or amended warrant.

    - Under this section, on appeals from convictions before a mayor, justice of the peace or police justice (now district court judges), the appellate court has full power to amend the warrants in any particular, or to issue new warrants in lieu thereof.

    - When it was brought to the attention of the trial court by accused that the appeal warrant charged him with an offense against the State, whereas he had been tried before the police justice for an offense against a city ordinance, it became the duty of the trial court, under this section, to amend the warrant so as to conform it to the facts so brought to its attention.

     Amendment did not render warrant defective.

    - Arrest warrant issued was not defective as a result of having been amended sometime prior to a trial de novo in the lower appellate court, where the dates of the offense were amended, as the same particularity was not required in warrants of arrest as was required in formal indictments; pursuant to
    
     §§
    
    16.1-129.2 and 16.1-137, as long as the warrant was not so defective as to fail to notify the defendant of the nature and character of the offense charged, both district courts and circuit courts had the power to amend a warrant in any respect in which the warrant appeared to be defective, on the courts' own motion and without the consent of the parties. Raja v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 710, 581 S.E.2d 237, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 318</cite> (2003).

        Even though the trial court allowed the indictment to be amended, the indictment was not rendered defective by the amendment.

        <b>
     The jurisdiction, practice, and procedure of the juvenile and domestic relations district courts are entirely statutory,
    </b>
    and are set forth in this chapter. Walker v. Department of Pub. Welfare, <cite class="va_code">223 Va. 557</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 887 (1982).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Strict compliance with substantive statutes required.
        </b>
        - Taken as a whole, the Virginia cases compel strict compliance with the requirements of the juvenile statutes that are not merely procedural. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         But failure to comply with any statute may not be jurisdictional defect.
        </b>
        - Virginia cases do not indicate that the failure to comply with any juvenile statute is a jurisdictional defect and establish no per se rule to that effect. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

      <p>
       This law shall be construed liberally and as remedial in character, and the powers hereby conferred are intended to be general to effect the beneficial purposes herein set forth. It is the intention of this law that in all proceedings the welfare of the child and the family, the safety of the community and the protection of the rights of victims are the paramount concerns of the Commonwealth and to the end that these purposes may be attained, the judge shall possess all necessary and incidental powers and authority, whether legal or equitable in their nature.
       <br/>

      <p>
       This law shall be interpreted and construed so as to effectuate the following purposes:

       <li id="t16.1c11a01s16.1-227ol11">
        To divert from or within the juvenile justice system, to the extent possible, consistent with the protection of the public safety, those children who can be cared for or treated through alternative programs;

        To provide judicial procedures through which the provisions of this law are executed and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair hearing and their constitutional and other rights are recognized and enforced;

        To separate a child from such child's parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis only when the child's welfare is endangered or it is in the interest of public safety and then only after consideration of alternatives to out-of-home placement which afford effective protection to the child, his family, and the community; and
       </li>
       <li id="t16.1c11a01s16.1-227ol14">
        To protect the community against those acts of its citizens, both juveniles and adults, which are harmful to others and to reduce the incidence of delinquent behavior and to hold offenders accountable for their behavior.

        <b>
     The primary function of the juvenile courts
    </b>
    properly considered is not conviction or punishment for crime; but crime prevention and juvenile rehabilitation. Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">198 Va. 833</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 14 (1957).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Strict compliance with substantive statutes required.
        </b>
        - Taken as a whole, the Virginia cases compel strict compliance with the requirements of the juvenile statutes that are not merely procedural. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         But failure to comply with any statute may not be jurisdictional defect.
        </b>
        - Virginia cases do not indicate that the failure to comply with any juvenile statute is a jurisdictional defect and establish no per se rule to that effect. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

         Impeachment with prior juvenile adjudications.
        </b>
        - A prosecutor may not impeach the defendant with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications, and the attempt to so cross-examine defendant was not harmless error. Lavinder v. Commonwealth, 395 S.E.2d 211 (1990).

     Authority to issue interlocutory order.

    - Trial court properly affirmed juvenile and domestic relations court's order which held the juvenile in contempt for failing to attend school, as
    
     §
    
    16.1-227 provided the court with authority to issue the interlocutory order. B.P. v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 735, 568 S.E.2d 412, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 498</cite> (2002).

     Best interests of child.
    </b>
    - Mother and father's apparent stipulation to the correctness of the juvenile and domestic relations court's adjudicatory order making a nonspecific finding that their child was abused was not binding on the trial court to the extent that agreement conflicted with the trial court's duty to determine what disposition would serve the best interest of the child. Thus, the trial court needed to hear evidence and make findings about who was inflicting the abuse, and what type of abuse was being inflicted, since
    
     §
    
    16.1-227 expressed the intent of the legislature that the welfare of the child and the family were the paramount concerns of the Commonwealth. Anonymous B v. Anonymous C, 51 Va. App. 657, 660 S.E.2d 307, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (2008).

    8.01-380</a></cite> because the evidence supported a finding that it was in the best interests of her child for the trial court to transfer the right to advocate for the protective order to the father and the guardian ad litem, and since the mother was a respondent to the preliminary protective order, her right to nonsuit the case against her was subordinate to the welfare of the child; in cases where allegations of child sexual abuse have been presented to the trial court and a preliminary protective order has been issued pursuant to those allegations, an alleged abuser's "right" to nonsuit must be subordinate to the welfare of the child, and the right to advocate a protective order on behalf of the child can be transferred to a party of interest.

         Equitable powers of juvenile court.

        - Juvenile court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction over the petition the city social services agency filed that alleged the minor child was a child in need of services and that continued placement in the home would be contrary to the minor child's welfare; evidence showing that the mother had previously abused the minor child's brother was sufficient to invoke the juvenile court's equitable jurisdiction even though the evidence did not show that the minor child had been abused, as the juvenile court was authorized to prevent the minor child's placement with a known abuser and did not have to wait for the minor child herself to be abused.

     Contempt proceedings.
    </b>
    - A juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) court may enforce, through indirect contempt proceedings, a provision of an emergency protective order (EPO) granting the petitioner the possession of a companion animal when a magistrate has issued the EPO. The contempt proceedings may be initiated by a JDR court through the issuance of a show cause summons. A JDR court has discretion in imposing punishment for a violation of a companion animal provision in an EPO, but the punishment may not exceed a jail sentence in excess of six months or a fine in excess of $500 without affording the defendant the right to trial by jury.

Further, a decision by parents who have legal authority for the child or, in the absence of parents with legal authority for the child, any person with legal authority for the child who refuses a particular medical treatment for a child with a life-threatening condition shall not be deemed a refusal to provide necessary care if (i) such decision is made jointly by the parents or other person with legal authority and the child; (ii) the child has reached 14 years of age and is sufficiently mature to have an informed opinion on the subject of his medical treatment; (iii) the parents or other person with legal authority and the child have considered alternative treatment options; and (iv) the parents or other person with legal authority and the child believe in good faith that such decision is in the child's best interest.

        <b>
         Guardianship, legal custody distinguished.
        </b>
        - The distinction between "legal custody" and "guardianship" is a reflection of the extent of the power over, and the responsibility to, the child involved in each. Thus, in the Commonwealth, legal custody is the right to have physical charge of the child and generally direct the day-to-day activities of the child's life. Guardianship of the person and estate of a child, by contrast, is a broader power to have the custody of the ward and the right to take possession of the ward's estate, real and personal, and out of the proceeds of such estate provide for the ward's maintenance and education. Additionally, the legal custodian, while being required to provide for the child, is not fiduciary or guarantor of the child. Rather, it is the guardian of the person and estate who carries the burden of managing the ward's estate and making good the lawful debts of his ward. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475 (1994).

        <b>
     Legal custodian not required to pay support for child in physical custody of another.
    </b>
    - Under the definition of "legal custody" in this section, a divorced grandmother and grandfather who had been granted joint legal custody of their granddaughter had the duty to provide her "with food, shelter, education and ordinary medical care," but no more; the grandfather was required to provide these necessities for the child during the periods of the year that she stayed with him, but he was not similarly responsible for her needs while she was staying with her grandmother. Russell v. Russell, 35 Va. App. 360, 545 S.E.2d 548, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 224</cite> (2001).

    - Child protective order did not in effect change legal custody of a child from a parent to a grandparent because the order only expressed certain responsibilities the grandparent was authorized to exercise while the child remained in the grandparent's care.

         Code contemplates intervention where severe injury likely if child returned to parent.
        </b>
        - The Code contemplates intervention in circumstances, which are without realistic probability of improvement of conditions, by allowing for the emergency removal of children before placement into an environment where the child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irreversible injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parent.

         Definition of abused or neglected child does not require proof of actual harm.
        </b>
        - The statutory definitions of an abused or neglected child do not require proof of actual harm or impairment having been experienced by the child. The term "substantial risk" speaks in futuro. Jenkins v. Winchester Dep't of Social Servs., 12 Va. App. 1178, 409 S.E.2d 16 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to show that the mother's child was neglected, as it showed that the mother violated a protective order that directed her to keep the child away from the mother's suspected abusive boyfriend and no showing had to be made that the child had been actually harmed, as the evidence showed that the child was at a substantial risk of future harm from him becuase the mother would not keep the child away from him although he was already suspected of having abused the child once. S.V.R. v. Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0073-04-1, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 450</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving termination of residual parental rights, removal of a child was warranted based on a father's history of not having provided his children with appropriate housing and his lack of a plan for appropriate housing since the definition of abused or neglected child did not require proof of actual harm or impairment; the term "substantial risk" spoke in futuro, and the living conditions in a motel were not adequate to meet the child's needs. Williams-Kemp v. Prince Edward County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1979-14-2, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 41</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 10, 2015).

     Violation not established.
    </b>
    - Alleged violation of subsection 1 was not established because there was no evidence that the children suffered any injury; while the Commonwealth referenced the "flat affect" as the mental injury, there was no evidence causally linking the flat affect of the children to any act or omission of defendant. Wilmer v. Commonwealth, No. 0654-16-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 223</cite> (Aug. 29, 2017).

         No evidence of active abuse but court found "passive" abuse.
        </b>
        - Where appellant contended that because there was no visible evidence of active abuse and trial court found "passive" abuse, that the requirements of this section were unmet, this position was without merit. The fact that the child suffered no injury while her parent was under the influence of self-induced drugs was not a mitigating circumstance. The evidence clearly supported the trial court's finding of neglect. Deskin v. Clarke County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0623-97-4 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 25, 1997).

         Ties between parent and child severed forever when parental rights terminated.

However, the status of legal custodian does not require a non-governmental entity such as their insurance carrier to recognize their financial responsibility for her medical care. Therefore, their insurance carrier could decline to recognize the child as an insured person until they obtained the status of legal guardians of the person in order to comply with their contract.

        Trial court did not err in finding that the mother abused or neglected her child because the evidence proved that the child had threatened to harm herself, had a plan to do so, and had done so in the past; when the school asked the mother to get the child evaluated, she refused to seek the appropriate medical care for the child; she continually denied that the child had any mental health issues, despite the fact that the child had expressed an intent to harm herself and had a plan to do so; and she essentially abandoned the child when she left her at the hospital and would not even talk with the child's doctor there.

        In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to show that the mother committed an act of family abuse because she admitted that she locked her son - who had had heat-induced seizures in the past - in the backseat of a car with only one window slightly open and left him there alone for an extended period of time while she continued shopping.

     Reasonable apprehension of family abuse.

    - In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the daughter had a reasonable apprehension of facing the same form of family abuse as her brother because a child could reasonably expect to face treatment from her parent similar to that received by her twin sibling. Walker v. Pierce, No. 0452-02-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 297</cite> (Dec. 8, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was evidence of a father's previous physical abuse against a mother, his pursuit of the mother and child in a car chase, his contact with the child and the mother at the child's sporting events despite the court order prohibiting him from attending, and his assault of a family friend in a parking lot at night in the mother and child's presence, the father's actions in stalking the mother and the child placed both in a reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to prove that in stalking a mother and a child, a father committed an act of abuse against a family member, and, therefore, the circuit court was authorized to issue an order to protect the mother and the child; the father intended to cause fear or knew or should have known that his conduct would cause fear for the mother and child because he pursued the mother and child in a car chase, and he knew the mother had reported that the child feared him.

     Insufficient evidence of abuse and neglect.
    </b>
    - Trial court erred in convicting defendant of causing an act or omission that rendered a child abused or neglected because he did not create or inflict a physical or mental injury upon the children or cause them to be without care by an unreasonable absence; both, or either of the children's mothers independently, were responsible for the children's care during the time that defendant left the children with them, and neither of the children was injured or harmed.

       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in finding that a mother abused or neglected the mother's children because a social services department presented evidence that the mother had verbally, emotionally, and physically abused all the children by kicking the children, hitting the children, throwing objects at the children, yelling at the children, and pulling the hair of the children. One child had attempted suicide multiple times, yet the mother insisted that the child was just seeking attention and did not need mental health treatment. Jaffar v.

     Dismissal of abuse and neglect finding.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not err in dismissing an abuse and neglect finding against a father because the guardian ad litem for the minor children left the dismissal on the grounds of mootness uncontested, and the basis of mootness alone provided a sufficient legal foundation for the circuit court's ruling; although the guardian argued the issue of mootness before the circuit court, he did not raise it on appeal, and thus his failure to address the issue resulted in a waiver of any claim of error.

     Sufficient evidence of child in need of services.

    - Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's finding that sixteen-year-old was a "child in need of services" under this section where she was taken by appellant to her home where she spent the night with appellant's son without her parents' permission and was involved in sexual activity and appellant was involved in preplanning this event, took the child from her home, lied both to her parents and the police about her departure and the circumstances surrounding her overnight stay. The court was justified in concluding that her family needed assistance and services to regain control over their daughter and to remove appellant's detrimental influence. Watkins v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court did not err in finding that a father's children were in need of services and in awarding custody to a paternal aunt because behavioral issues associated with the children were affecting their well-being and safety - the children were lying, using drugs, and had been suspended from school - and the father was unable and perhaps unwilling to see to their needs.

       <p>
        Trial court properly found that a child was a child in need of services and approved the foster care plan with the goal of adoption because the child's mental condition was attributed to inconsistency in primary caregivers due in part to the frequent removals caused by the custodian's drug problems, the child needed the permanent stability that could only be found through continuing the foster care placement with the foster mother, and the trial court properly considered appropriate factors, including the best interests of the child, in making its decision.

         Purpose.
        </b>
        - This section, in effect, gives the Commonwealth's attorney some discretion in prosecuting certain criminal cases in the juvenile and domestic relations courts and requires him to prosecute all cases appealed to the circuit court. But the statute does not confer authority to represent parties in civil cases in which the Commonwealth is not a party in interest. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169 (1987).

        <b>
         Duty to prosecute foreign support orders.
        </b>
        - The Commonwealth's attorney has a duty to prosecute foreign support orders that are properly before a Virginia court pursuant to the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (
        §§
        20-88.12 to 20-88.31) [see now the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (
        <span class="s1">

        20-88.32 et. seq.)] Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169 (1987).

        <b>
         The word "case,"
        </b>
        as used in the second paragraph of this section, refers to the cases described in the paragraph immediately preceding it. The first paragraph provides that the Commonwealth shall prosecute felony charges before the juvenile court and may prosecute misdemeanor charges before that court, but shall be required to do so only when the court so directs. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The second paragraph of this section, which states that the Commonwealth shall represent the state in all cases appealed from the juvenile and domestic relations district court to the circuit court, refers only to cases in which the Commonwealth is a party or, at least, has an interest. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169 (1987).

        <b>
         Real party in interest has right to own counsel.
        </b>
        - In civil matters appealed to the circuit court, the Commonwealth may have a theoretical interest in seeing that the best interests of children are provided for in both custody disputes and support proceedings. However, the real party in interest has a right to his or her own counsel. Certainly the legislature never intended that under these circumstances the Commonwealth's attorney be allowed to control litigation in a purely civil case. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169 (1987).

      <p>
       In any case in which the juvenile is alleged to have committed a violent juvenile felony enumerated in subsection B of § 16.1-269.1, and for any charges ancillary thereto, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall be limited to conducting a preliminary hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the act alleged and that the juvenile was 16 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, and any matters related thereto. In any case in which the juvenile is alleged to have committed a violent juvenile felony enumerated in subsection C of § 16.1-269.1, and for all charges ancillary thereto, if the attorney for the Commonwealth has given notice as provided in subsection C of § 16.1-269.1, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall be limited to conducting a preliminary hearing to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the act alleged and that the juvenile was 16 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, and any matters related thereto. A determination by the juvenile court following a preliminary hearing pursuant to subsection B or C of § 16.1-269.1 to certify a charge to the grand jury shall divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction over the charge and any ancillary charge. In any case in which a transfer hearing is held pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-269.1, if the juvenile court determines to transfer the case, jurisdiction of the juvenile court over the case shall be divested as provided in § 16.1-269.6.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In all other cases involving delinquent acts, and in cases in which an ancillary charge remains after a violent juvenile felony charge has been dismissed or a violent juvenile felony has been reduced to a lesser offense not constituting a violent juvenile felony, the jurisdiction of the juvenile court shall not be divested unless there is a transfer pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-269.1.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority of the juvenile court to adjudicate matters involving the custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child shall not be limited to the consideration of petitions filed by a mother, father or legal guardian but shall include petitions filed at any time by any party with a legitimate interest therein. A party with a legitimate interest shall be broadly construed and shall include, but not be limited to, grandparents, step-grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members. A party with a legitimate interest shall not include any person (i) whose parental rights have been terminated by court order, either voluntarily or involuntarily, (ii) whose interest in the child derives from or through a person whose parental rights have been terminated by court order, either voluntarily or involuntarily, including, but not limited to, grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members, if the child subsequently has been legally adopted, except where a final order of adoption is entered pursuant to § 63.2-1241, or (iii) who has been convicted of a violation of subsection A of § 18.2-61, § 18.2-63, subsection B of § 18.2-366, or an equivalent offense of another state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, when the child who is the subject of the petition was conceived as a result of such violation. The authority of the juvenile court to consider a petition involving the custody of a child shall not be proscribed or limited where the child has previously been awarded to the custody of a local board of social services.
      </p>
      <p>
       A1. Making specific findings of fact required by state or federal law to enable a child to apply for or receive a state or federal benefit. For the purposes of this subsection only, when the court has obtained jurisdiction over the case of any child, the court may continue to exercise its jurisdiction until such person reaches 21 years of age, for the purpose of entering findings of fact or amending past orders, to include findings of fact necessary for the person to petition the federal government for status as a special immigrant juvenile, as defined by 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(J).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for felonies over which the court has jurisdiction, jurisdiction shall be limited to determining whether or not there is probable cause. Any objection based on jurisdiction under this subsection shall be made before a jury is impaneled and sworn in a jury trial or, in a nonjury trial, before the earlier of when the court begins to hear or receive evidence or the first witness is sworn, or it shall be conclusively waived for all purposes. Any such objection shall not affect or be grounds for challenging directly or collaterally the jurisdiction of the court in which the case is tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a hearing, a judge shall issue an order authorizing a physician to perform an abortion, without the consent of any authorized person, if he finds that (i) the minor is mature enough and well enough informed to make her abortion decision, in consultation with her physician, independent of the wishes of any authorized person, or (ii) the minor is not mature enough or well enough informed to make such decision, but the desired abortion would be in her best interest.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the judge authorizes an abortion based on the best interests of the minor, such order shall expressly state that such authorization is subject to the physician or his agent giving notice of intent to perform the abortion; however, no such notice shall be required if the judge finds that such notice would not be in the best interest of the minor. In determining whether notice is in the best interest of the minor, the judge shall consider the totality of the circumstances; however, he shall find that notice is not in the best interest of the minor if he finds that (a) one or more authorized persons with whom the minor regularly and customarily resides is abusive or neglectful and (b) every other authorized person, if any, is either abusive or neglectful or has refused to accept responsibility as parent, legal guardian, custodian or person standing in loco parentis.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The minor may participate in the court proceedings on her own behalf, and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor. The court shall advise the minor that she has a right to counsel and shall, upon her request, appoint counsel for her.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of this subsection shall govern proceedings relating to consent for a minor's abortion. Court proceedings under this subsection and records of such proceedings shall be confidential. Such proceedings shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay in order to serve the best interests of the minor. Court proceedings under this subsection shall be heard and decided as soon as practicable but in no event later than four days after the petition is filed.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       An expedited confidential appeal to the circuit court shall be available to any minor for whom the court denies an order authorizing an abortion without consent or without notice. Any such appeal shall be heard and decided no later than five days after the appeal is filed. The time periods required by this subsection shall be subject to subsection B of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c2.1a02s1-210" target="_blank">§ 1-210</a></cite>. An order authorizing an abortion without consent or without notice shall not be subject to appeal.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       No filing fees shall be required of the minor at trial or upon appeal.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If either the original court or the circuit court fails to act within the time periods required by this subsection, the court before which the proceeding is pending shall immediately authorize a physician to perform the abortion without consent of or notice to an authorized person.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed to authorize a physician to perform an abortion on a minor in circumstances or in a manner that would be unlawful if performed on an adult woman.
       <br/>

         Constitutionality of parental notice provision.
        </b>
        - The Parental Notice Act, as legislation that respects the fundamental interests of responsible parents in the rearing and in the educational, moral and religious development of their children, without unduly burdening the fundamental abortion right, is facially constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The unmistakable implication in this section and the guidelines given by the supreme court to its lower courts is that, whenever possible, bypass petitions should be resolved within the four-day statutory period required for holding hearings and no more is required to sustain the statute against a facial challenge to its constitutionality. Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The imposing confidentiality protections provided for in this and other statutes and promulgated by the supreme court in the form of instructions to the judges and clerks who will handle cases under the parental notification law, would be adequate to sustain a statute requiring parental consent and they are clearly adequate to sustain this statute requiring only notice. Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provided that a parental notice statute, such as this one, does not condition the minor's access to abortion upon notice to abusive or neglectful parents, absent parents who have not assumed their parental responsibilities or parents with similar relationships with their daughters, nothing more is required in order to withstand a facial challenge to its constitutionality. Planned Parenthood of the Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F.3d 352 (4th Cir. 1998).

        Juvenile and Domestic Relations District (JDR) court and a circuit court on appeal were not required to make findings supporting a child's application for Special Immigrant Juvenile status when awarding custody because these courts did not decide if any such findings made when awarding custody helped a child achieve such status.

     Award of custody to non-parents.
    </b>
    - Because there was sufficient evidence to show that child's father was unfit, there was a compelling state interest for the court to award custody to non-parents; the father, therefore, was not deprived of substantive due process and this section was not unconstitutional. Switzer v. Smith, Nos. 0779-00-3, 1159-00-3, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 454</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 31, 2001).

    - While defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that she was a contributing factor to her daughter's need for supervision as required under this section, the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that she contributed to the need for supervision and, therefore, the juvenile court had jurisdiction to order the alcohol evaluation.

Therefore, since defendant was never brought before a juvenile and domestic relations district court for the purpose of determining probable cause, or for any purpose, but rather was brought before the general district court which acted in the absence of jurisdiction and thus had no power to certify the case to the circuit court, the forgery conviction should be vacated.

    - The defendant burglarized the house of the widow of his father. He was brought before general district court for a preliminary hearing, indicted, and tried in the circuit court. The fact that the defendant was the illegitimate son of the victim's deceased husband was stipulated. The defendant contended that he was a stepchild of the victim and should have been tried under this section. Without a former marriage no stepchild is possible and the defendant fell under neither the technical definition of a stepchild nor in the statutory intent to protect and preserve family harmony. Consequently, the general district court was the proper forum for the defendant's criminal prosecution to begin. Bell v. Commonwealth, No. 0799-95-1, 1996 <cite class="va_code">Va.

        Circuit court properly dismissed a mother's appeal-of an order denying her motions to restore her parental rights and for full custody of her child-for lack of jurisdiction because the mother was not a "party with a legitimate interest" where her parental rights had been terminated, the child adopted, and she had exhausted her appeals of that decision, and the record did not reflect that she filed any objections to the transcript with the clerk of the circuit court.

        </b>
        - Parents did not waive their challenge to the validity of entrustment agreements signed by their children's aunt when the termination issue was tried de novo in the circuit court because the question of whether requirements of this section were met, and particularly whether the children were the subjects of a valid entrustment agreement, was jurisdictional in nature; because the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived by the parties, the validity of the entrustment agreements was properly before the circuit court even assuming the parents had entered an agreed order in the juvenile and domestic relations court approving the execution of the challenged agreements.

        - Since petitioner was a child's foster parent for the first eighteen months of the child's life, cared for the child continuously during that period, held the same place in the emotional life of the foster child, and fulfilled the same socializing functions as a natural family, she qualified as a "persona with a legitimate interest" and had standing to pursue her petition for custody of the child.

        - Although parents claimed they did not cause their 11-month-old daughter's injuries and did not allow someone else to cause her injuries, a doctor's testimony that the child displayed symptoms of shaken baby syndrome was sufficient for the court to find that the child was abused or neglected, within the meaning of
        §

         Jurisdiction over child in need of services petition.

        - Juvenile court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction over the petition the city social services agency filed that alleged the minor child was a child in need of services and that continued placement in the home would be contrary to the minor child's welfare; evidence showing that the mother had previously abused the minor child's brother was sufficient to invoke the juvenile court's equitable jurisdiction even though the evidence did not show that the minor child had been abused, as the juvenile court was authorized to prevent the minor child's placement with a known abuser and did not have to wait for the minor child herself to be abused.

       <p>
        Because a mother nonsuited a petition for child support in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, her current petition for child support was not before the circuit court on an appeal; therefore, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over the petition in that manner, and the filing of the petition in the circuit court was not an appropriate proceeding because child support was not incidental to the custody trial the circuit court would hear.

       <p>
        Father's motion to dismiss a mother's petition for child support for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was granted because the juvenile and domestic relations district court was not without jurisdiction to hear the petition, and there was no good cause to bring it before the circuit court; any perceived convenience for the parties did not amount to "good cause," especially when the juvenile and domestic relations district court retained jurisdiction to hear the petition.

         Generally, under statutory scheme, juvenile courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in custody cases unless and until circuit courts assume jurisdiction.
        </b>
        The circuit courts may assume jurisdiction either by an appeal from the juvenile courts or by the direct filing of an appropriate proceeding in the circuit courts. The procedural standard to be applied in the circuit courts is dictated by the manner in which those courts assume jurisdiction. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).

         Waiver of jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Nothing in either
        §
        16.1-241 or this section permits the juvenile court to "waive" its jurisdiction and allow a party to bring an original action in the circuit court without meeting the statutory requirements. Willis v. Gamez, 20 Va. App. 75, 455 S.E.2d 274 (1995).

         Mere filing of divorce suit by husband prior to participating in subsequent juvenile court proceeding did not sufficiently "challenge" juvenile court order

     Courts of equity not divested of all power to determine custody of children.
    </b>
    - It is evident, as indicated by the language of this section, that it was not the purpose of the legislature to divest courts of equity of all power to determine the custody of children. Under this section a court of record has concurrent jurisdiction to determine the custody of children: (1) upon a writ of habeas corpus; and (2) in a suit in equity when custody is incidental to the determination of the cause. Poole v. Poole, <cite class="va_code">210 Va. 442</cite>, 171 S.E.2d 685 (1970).

        <b>
     Jurisdiction of circuit court over custody petition.
    </b>
    - Although a circuit court had acquired jurisdiction solely by virtue of an appealed visitation petition, custody was incidental to visitation under the circumstances and the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to transfer custody. Cintron v. Long, No. 2169-99-2, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 487</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 5, 2000).

        <b>
         Authority of circuit court to reinstate case on docket.
        </b>
        - Circuit court had authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to entertain the parties' motions to enforce visitation rights and to modify child support after having transferred "all matters . . . pertaining to child support, visitation rights [and] custody of the minor children" to the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to
        §
        20-79(c). Although a final divorce decree had been entered, when the case was reinstated on the docket of the circuit court, the case was "pending" for consideration of those matters over which the circuit court had continuing jurisdiction. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A "transfer" of "any other matters pertaining to support and maintenance . . . and custody" to the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to
        §
        20-79(c) conveys concurrent jurisdiction on the juvenile and domestic relations district court to hear those matters, but the transfer does not divest the circuit court of its continuing jurisdiction to consider those issues, should it exercise its discretion to do so. Accordingly, the circuit court had the authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to consider the motions to modify child support and visitation. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883 (1993).

        <b>
         Distinction between appeal and divestiture of jurisdiction.
        </b>
        - Under the statutory scheme this distinction between an appeal under
        §
        16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of subsection A is intentional and consistent with and conducive to the best interests of children who are the subjects of custody disputes between their natural parents, the protection of parental rights, and, less significantly, with the notion of judicial economy. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an appeal to the circuit court, the "advantage" granted to the noncustodial parent is simply the avoidance of the additional burden of proof imposed by the change in circumstance test; in the de novo appeal, the issue is simply what is in the best interests of the child. Accordingly, the procedural distinction between an appeal under
        §
        16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of this section is significant and perhaps controlling in most cases. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The procedural distinction between an appeal under
        §
        16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of this section relating to divorce proceedings is significant. An order adjudicating an appeal from the juvenile court to the circuit court is not entitled to the procedural convenience of transfer provided by
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        20-79. Rather, such order, together with related issues embraced by the appeal, rests within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court pending disposition by that court. Calfee v. Calfee, 29 Va. App. 88, 509 S.E.2d 552 (1999).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Divestiture of jurisdiction in juvenile court simply provides for orderly transfer of concurrent jurisdiction
        </b>
        to the sole jurisdiction of the superior circuit court. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Unlike an appeal, divestiture provisions of subsection A do not annul judgment of juvenile court
        </b>
        as if no previous hearing occurred. Rather the judgment of the juvenile court remains in full force and effect until modified by the circuit court to which jurisdiction has been transferred. In modifying the prior order, the procedural standard to be applied is the "change in circumstances" test which affords the benefit of stability to the child. It further ensures an orderly administration of the judicial process in both levels of courts with concurrent jurisdiction in these cases in which natural parents regrettably too often find themselves. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232 (1988).
        <br/>
       </p>

        <b>
     Hearing not scheduled as required; divestiture not successful.
    </b>
    - Although husband fully utilized the concurrent jurisdiction initially available to him in both the trial and juvenile and domestic courts, simultaneously filing a bill of complaint for divorce in the trial court seeking, inter alia, child custody and support, and a petition pursuing identical relief in the juvenile and domestic court, the record did not reveal that a hearing on the matters of custody or support was thereafter scheduled in the trial court for a date certain to be heard within 21 days of filing, as required by subsection A. Thus, the institution of the divorce proceedings, together with the related prayers, did not divest the juvenile and domestic court from shared jurisdiction. Rose v. Bartlett, No. 2776-99-3, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 438</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 13, 2000).

        <b>
         Jurisdiction over adoption petition.
        </b>
        - Adoptive parents' failure to timely appeal the juvenile court's visitation order was of no legal consequence because there was no need for them to file a separate pleading to seek the termination of biological grandparents' visitation when entry of the order of adoption divested the grandparents of any right to visitation; the petition for adoption necessarily implied a question of the grandparents' ongoing visitation, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition.

The juvenile and domestic relations district courts of Virginia have general jurisdiction over all proceedings involving the custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child, except as otherwise provided in this section.

       In any civil case heard in a juvenile and domestic relations district court involving allegations of child abuse or neglect or family abuse, any party may present evidence, by a report from the treating or examining health care provider as defined in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-581.1" target="_blank">§ 8.01-581.1</a></cite> or the records of a hospital, medical facility or laboratory at which the treatment, examination or laboratory analysis was performed, or both, as to the extent, nature, and treatment of any physical condition or injury suffered by a person and the examination of the person or the result of the laboratory analysis.
    <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A medical report shall be admitted if the party intending to present such evidence at trial or hearing gives the opposing party or parties a copy of the evidence and written notice of intention to present it at least 10 days, or in the case of a preliminary removal hearing under § 16.1-252 or in preliminary protective order hearings under § 16.1-253 or 16.1-253.1 at least 24 hours, prior to the trial or hearing and if attached to such evidence is a sworn statement of the treating or examining health care provider or laboratory analyst who made the report that (i) the information contained therein is true, accurate, and fully describes the nature and extent of the physical condition or injury and (ii) the patient named therein was the person treated or examined by such health care provider; or, in the case of a laboratory analysis, that the information contained therein is true and accurate.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A hospital or other medical facility record shall be admitted if attached to it is a sworn statement of the custodian thereof that the same is a true and accurate copy of the record of such hospital or other medical facility. If thereafter a party summons the health care provider or custodian making such statement to testify in proper person or by deposition taken de bene esse, the court shall determine which party shall pay the fees and costs for such appearance or depositions, or may apportion the same among the parties in such proportion as the ends of justice may require. If such health care provider or custodian is not subject to subpoena for cross-examination in court or by a deposition de bene esse, then the court shall allow a reasonable opportunity for the party seeking the subpoena for such health care provider or custodian to obtain his testimony as the ends of justice may require.

     Introduction into evidence of psychological evaluation.
    </b>
    - In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the court properly allowed the introduction into evidence of the mother's psychological evaluation as the report was previously made a part of the file in the juvenile court and the juvenile court documents were admitted in evidence.

     Admission of medical records harmless error.
    </b>
    - Assuming the circuit court erred in admitting a child's medical records, the error was harmless because the county department of family services presented sufficient evidence to terminate the mother's parental rights without the admission of the medical records; the trial court found that the mother had limitations that affected her ability to adequately care for the child and his siblings and she was unwilling to accept assistance.

    - Denial of bond to the juvenile defendant was supported by the finding that there was probable cause to believe defendant committed the charged weapons offenses, as the uncontested facts showed officers saw defendant with bulge in his pocket that looked like a gun and a loaded gun was found near where the bulge mysteriously disappeared. Moreover, it was uncontested that the alleged acts would have been a Class 1 misdemeanor if committed by an adult and violated the terms of his parole for what would have been felony if committed by an adult.

The director of the facility or his designee may proceed to obtain the records from the provider if such consent is refused or is not readily obtainable and the records are necessary (i) for the provision of health care to the juvenile, (ii) to protect the health and safety of the juvenile or other residents or staff of the facility or (iii) to maintain the security and safety of the facility.
       <br/>
      </p>

         Code contemplates intervention where severe injury likely if child returned to parent.
        </b>
        - The Code contemplates intervention in circumstances, which are without realistic probability of improvement of conditions, by allowing for the emergency removal of children before placement into an environment where the child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irreversible injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parent.

     Relation to custody statutes.
    </b>
    - Court of appeals erred when the court upheld a circuit court's decision awarding custody of a child who had been adjudicated as abused and neglected and removed the child from the child's parents, pursuant to
    
     §§
    
    16.1-251 and 16.1-252, giving custody to the child's grandparents, based on the court's conclusion that language in subsection A of

    16.1-241 and subsection B of
    <span class="s1">

    16.1-278.15 subordinated Virginia statutes on foster care to Virginia's general custody statutes. The only interpretation of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.016.1.html" target="_self">Titles 16.1</a></cite> and 20 that gave effect to both statutory schemes and the intent of the Virginia General Assembly was that a trial court had to make the specific factual findings required by the foster care statutes in a custody case involving a child who was subject to a foster care plan.

     Statute is procedural and directory.
    </b>
    - Because subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-251 does not expressly prohibit the juvenile and domestic relations district court from conducting a preliminary removal hearing beyond the five-business-day period, is not prohibitive or limiting, and does not contain any manifestation of a contrary intent, subsection B of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    16.1-251 is procedural and directory, rather than mandatory and jurisdictional; although subsection B does provide that the hearing shall be held "in no event" later than five business days after the removal of the child, this phrase does not suggest an intent that the statute be deemed mandatory and jurisdictional because subsection B of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    16.1-251 contains no explicit penalty for failure to comply with the five-day requirement nor explicitly renders a hearing held beyond the five-day period invalid. Marrison v.

    16.1-251 was procedural and directory, rather than mandatory and jurisdictional, and the parents failed to show that they suffered any prejudice as a result of the juvenile and domestic relations district court's alleged failure to comply with subsection B of

    16.1-241, the department's action invoked the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court, upon appeal to the circuit court, the circuit court's jurisdiction was derivative of that of the district court, and therefore, if the district court had subject matter jurisdiction, so too did the circuit court upon appeal from the district court order.

     Evidence of neglect supported emergency order of removal.
    </b>
    - Evidence showed that father's action in taking his children to a bank where he and the mother uttered a forgery, which caused the police to take the father and mother away to jail, caused the father to be unreasonably absent and the children to be without parental care; accordingly, the trial court's finding that the children were neglected, for the purposes of the city welfare agency's request for an emergency order of removal of the children, was not clearly erroneous and was affirmed.

     Removal appropriate.
    </b>
    - In a case involving termination of residual parental rights, removal of a child was warranted based on a father's history of not having provided his children with appropriate housing and his lack of a plan for appropriate housing since the definition of abused or neglected child did not require proof of actual harm or impairment; the term "substantial risk" spoke in futuro, and the living conditions in a motel were not adequate to meet the child's needs.

        Trial court did not err in its decision approving the removal and initial foster care plans relating to two children because the record supported the findings that the children were abused and neglected where the children were residing in a hotel room that was filthy. The trial court did not err by finding that there was no less drastic alternative than removal and foster care placement due to the fact that a grandmother's house was not an option due to the lack of space; moreover, the father failed to clean and maintain the hotel room after a court hearing informed him of the need to do so.

        Circuit court did not err in finding sufficient evidence of abuse or neglect or in ordering that children remain with their fathers because the mother had numerous reports, investigations, and family assessments over the years; the department of social services (DSS) did not fail to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal because the mother not only failed to provide DSS an opportunity to inspect and approve possible homes but also relocated her children without notifying DSS.

        Prior to the removal hearing, notice of the hearing shall be given at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing to the guardian ad litem for the child, to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis of the child and to the child if he or she is 12 years of age or older. If notice to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis cannot be given despite diligent efforts to do so, the hearing shall be held nonetheless, and the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis shall be afforded a later hearing on their motion regarding a continuation of the summary removal order. The notice provided herein shall include (i) the time, date and place for the hearing; (ii) a specific statement of the factual circumstances which allegedly necessitate removal of the child; and (iii) notice that child support will be considered if a determination is made that the child must be removed from the home.

The provisions of § 63.2-1521 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the use of two-way closed-circuit television except that the person seeking the order shall apply for the order at least 48 hours before the hearing, unless the court for good cause shown allows the application to be made at a later time.

The court's order transferring temporary custody to a person with a legitimate interest should provide for compliance with any preliminary protective order entered on behalf of the child in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-253; initiation and completion of the investigation as directed by the court and court review of the child's placement required in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-278.2; and, as appropriate, ongoing provision of social services to the child and the temporary custodian.

        - Although parents claimed they did not cause their 11-month-old daughter's injuries and did not allow someone else to cause her injuries, a doctor's testimony that the child displayed symptoms of shaken baby syndrome was sufficient for the court to find that the child was abused or neglected, within the meaning of

       <li id="t16.1c11a04s16.1-253ol1A">
        Upon the motion of any person or upon the court's own motion, the court may issue a preliminary protective order, after a hearing, if necessary to protect a child's life, health, safety or normal development pending the final determination of any matter before the court. The order may require a child's parents, guardian, legal custodian, other person standing in loco parentis or other family or household member of the child to observe reasonable conditions of behavior for a specified length of time. These conditions shall include any one or more of the following:
        <ol>
         <li id="t16.1c11a04s16.1-253ol1A1">
          To abstain from offensive conduct against the child, a family or household member of the child or any person to whom custody of the child is awarded;
         </li>
         <li id="t16.1c11a04s16.1-253ol1A2">
          To cooperate in the provision of reasonable services or programs designed to protect the child's life, health or normal development;

         <li id="t16.1c11a04s16.1-253ol1A3">
          To allow persons named by the court to come into the child's home at reasonable times designated by the court to visit the child or inspect the fitness of the home and to determine the physical or emotional health of the child;
         </li>
         <li id="t16.1c11a04s16.1-253ol1A4">

          To refrain from such contact with the child or family or household members of the child, as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such person from the residence of the child. However, prior to the issuance by the court of an order removing such person from the residence of the child, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such person's probable future conduct would constitute a danger to the life or health of such child, and that there are no less drastic alternatives which could reasonably and adequately protect the child's life or health pending a final determination on the petition; or

        A preliminary protective order may be issued ex parte upon motion of any person or the court's own motion in any matter before the court, or upon petition. The motion or petition shall be supported by an affidavit or by sworn testimony in person before the judge or intake officer which establishes that the child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that delay for the provision of an adversary hearing would be likely to result in serious or irremediable injury to the child's life or health. If an ex parte order is issued without an affidavit being presented, the court, in its order, shall state the basis upon which the order was entered, including a summary of the allegations made and the court's findings. Following the issuance of an ex parte order the court shall provide an adversary hearing to the affected parties within the shortest practicable time not to exceed five business days after the issuance of the order.

        If a petition alleging abuse or neglect of a child has been filed, at the hearing pursuant to this section the court shall determine whether the allegations of abuse or neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Any finding of abuse or neglect shall be stated in the court order. However, if, before such a finding is made, a person responsible for the care and custody of the child, the child's guardian ad litem or the local department of social services objects to a finding being made at the hearing, the court shall schedule an adjudicatory hearing to be held within 30 days of the date of the initial preliminary protective order hearing. The adjudicatory hearing shall be held to determine whether the allegations of abuse and neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Parties who are present at the hearing shall be given notice of the date set for the adjudicatory hearing and parties who are not present shall be summoned as provided in § 16.1-263. The adjudicatory hearing shall be held and an order may be entered, although a party to the hearing fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, provided personal or substituted service was made on the person, or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effort, or in the case of a person who is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office address cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort.

The order may be issued in an ex parte proceeding upon good cause shown when the petition is supported by an affidavit or sworn testimony before the judge or intake officer. If an ex parte order is issued without an affidavit or a completed form as prescribed by subsection D of § 16.1-253.4 being presented, the court, in its order, shall state the basis upon which the order was entered, including a summary of the allegations made and the court's findings. Immediate and present danger of family abuse or evidence sufficient to establish probable cause that family abuse has recently occurred shall constitute good cause. Evidence that the petitioner has been subjected to family abuse within a reasonable time and evidence of immediate and present danger of family abuse may be established by a showing that (i) the allegedly abusing person is incarcerated and is to be released from incarceration within 30 days following the petition or has been released from incarceration within 30 days prior to the petition, (ii) the crime for which the allegedly abusing person was convicted and incarcerated involved family abuse against the petitioner, and (iii) the allegedly abusing person has made threatening contact with the petitioner while he was incarcerated, exhibiting a renewed threat to the petitioner of family abuse.

        Evidence was sufficient to prove that in stalking a mother and a child, a father committed an act of abuse against a family member, and, therefore, the circuit court was authorized to issue an order to protect the mother and the child; the father intended to cause fear or knew or should have known that his conduct would cause fear for the mother and child because he pursued the mother and child in a car chase, and he knew the mother had reported that the child feared him.

     Sufficient evidence of furtive entry.
    </b>
    - Defendant was properly convicted of a felony violation of
    
     §
    
    16.1-253.2 because sufficient evidence demonstrated that defendant "furtively entered" the home a victim protected by a protective order, as the noise caused when defendant broke a window to enter the home did not cause the entry not to be "furtive," as the noise and brazenness of defendant's subsequent assault was irrelevant, since the violation was complete as soon as defendant entered the home.

        <b>
     Evidence of social media contact supported conviction.
    </b>
    - Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for violation of a protective order, as he intentionally directed the communication to the victim by using the public forum available through the social media forum, Twitter; the post specifically instructed anyone reading it to relay the message to the victim, and once she learned of the post, she viewed it and felt intimidated and shocked. Defendant intentionally contacted the victim, albeit indirectly. Green v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 193, 843 S.E.2d 389, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 174</cite> (2020).

        <b>
     Sufficient evidence to support conviction.
    </b>
    - Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that defendant was on the complaining party's property in violation of a protective order because (1) the complaining party received a phone call, which informed the party that defendant was released from jail; (2) about an hour later the complaining party, after hearing knocking at the bedroom window and front door, saw defendant walking away from the party's house; (3) the complaining party's friend and neighbor then heard knocking at the front door and saw defendant leave; and (4) a responding police officer then encountered defendant a block from the complaining party's house.

       </p>
       <p>
        Rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating a protective order because there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant was present in the victim's house and that he was barred from the house; the protective order barring defendant from the premises was admitted into evidence, and defendant pawned rings taken from the jewelry box in the victim's bedroom, the obvious inference being he obtained the rings by entering the house.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of violating a preliminary protective order because the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant made contact with the victim in violation of a protective order in that defendant's proximity to the victim's home while taking pictures posed a threat to the victim's mental and physical health and the victim's safety.

        Victim's testimony that defendant gestured her in a threatening manner and made the sign of a pistol with his hand and then pulled an imaginary trigger, and judicial notice of the fact that defendant would have been within 1,000 feet of the victim anywhere in the subject parking lot was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for violating a protective order.

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of violating a protective order by committing an assault and battery that resulted in bodily injury because the victim testified that defendant bit her on the leg or knee and that she screamed; although defendant had forcibly entered the victim's house without permission and in violation of the protective order, she did not scream until after defendant had bitten her; the timing of her scream evinced pain and hurt based on defendant's bite; and, although the evidence did not demonstrate that defendant left bite marks on the victim, the Commonwealth was not required to prove that she suffered any observable wounds, cuts, or breaking of the skin to sustain a conviction.

     Conviction for violating protective order reversed.
    </b>
    - Because insufficient evidence showed that defendant had notice of the terms of a protective order entered against her, and the victim never testified that a judge verbally ordered defendant to have no further contact with him, defendant's conviction for disobeying the terms of said order, in violation of

         Enforcement of protective orders.
        </b>
        - A law-enforcement agency should not remove a protective order from Virginia Criminal Information Network (VCIN) unless it receives a court order of dissolution or the protective order has expired by its own terms or by operation of law.
    Where more than one active protective order exists involving the same parties, an individual may be charged with violating a discrete provision of either order. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Steve A. Hutcherson, Campbell County Sheriff's Office, 19-006, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 37 (12/20/19).

     Contempt proceedings.
    </b>
    - A juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) court may enforce, through indirect contempt proceedings, a provision of an emergency protective order granting the petitioner the possession of a companion animal when a magistrate has issued the emergency protective order. The contempt proceedings may be initiated by a JDR court through the issuance of a show cause summons. A JDR court has discretion in imposing punishment for a violation of a companion animal provision in an emergency protective order, but the punishment may not exceed a jail sentence in excess of six months or a fine in excess of $500 without affording the defendant the right to trial by jury.

Filson, Chief Judge, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for the 25th Judicial District, No.<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.14.html#t14c14-033" target="_blank"> 14-033</a></cite>, 2014 Va.

    - A juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) court may enforce, through indirect contempt proceedings, a provision of an emergency protective order granting the petitioner the possession of a companion animal when a magistrate has issued the emergency protective order. The contempt proceedings may be initiated by a JDR court through the issuance of a show cause summons. A JDR court has discretion in imposing punishment for a violation of a companion animal provision in an emergency protective order, but the punishment may not exceed a jail sentence in excess of six months or a fine in excess of $500 without affording the defendant the right to trial by jury.

        All matters alleged to be within the jurisdiction of the court shall be commenced by the filing of a petition, except as provided in subsection H and in § 16.1-259. The form and content of the petition shall be as provided in § 16.1-262. No individual shall be required to obtain support services from the Department of Social Services prior to filing a petition seeking support for a child. Complaints, requests, and the processing of petitions to initiate a case shall be the responsibility of the intake officer. However, (i) the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county may file a petition on his own motion with the clerk; (ii) designated nonattorney employees of the Department of Social Services may complete, sign, and file petitions and motions relating to the establishment, modification, or enforcement of support on forms approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia with the clerk; (iii) designated nonattorney employees of a local department of social services may complete, sign, and file with the clerk, on forms approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia, petitions for foster care review, petitions for permanency planning hearings, petitions to establish paternity, motions to establish or modify support, motions to amend or review an order, and motions for a rule to show cause; and (iv) any attorney may file petitions on behalf of his client with the clerk except petitions alleging that the subject of the petition is a child alleged to be in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinquent. Complaints alleging abuse or neglect of a child shall be referred initially to the local department of social services in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ 63.2-1500 et seq.) of Title 63.2. Motions and other subsequent pleadings in a case shall be filed directly with the clerk. The intake officer or clerk with whom the petition or motion is filed shall inquire whether the petitioner is receiving child support services or public assistance. No individual who is receiving support services or public assistance shall be denied the right to file a petition or motion to establish, modify, or enforce an order for support of a child. If the petitioner is seeking or receiving child support services or public assistance, the clerk, upon issuance of process, shall forward a copy of the petition or motion, together with notice of the court date, to the Division of Child Support Enforcement. If a petitioner is seeking to establish child support, the intake officer shall provide the petitioner information on the possible availability of medical assistance through the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) plan or other government-sponsored coverage through the Department of Medical Assistance Services.

        The appearance of a child before an intake officer may be by (i) personal appearance before the intake officer or (ii) use of two-way electronic video and audio communication. If two-way electronic video and audio communication is used, an intake officer may exercise all powers conferred by law. All communications and proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as if the appearance were in person, and any documents filed may be transmitted by facsimile process. The facsimile may be served or executed by the officer or person to whom sent, and returned in the same manner, and with the same force, effect, authority, and liability as an original document. All signatures thereon shall be treated as original signatures. Any two-way electronic video and audio communication system used for an appearance shall meet the standards as set forth in subsection B of § 19.2-3.1.

        The intake officer shall accept and file a petition in which it is alleged that (i) the custody, visitation, or support of a child is the subject of controversy or requires determination, (ii) a person has deserted, abandoned, or failed to provide support for any person in violation of law, (iii) a child or such child's parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis is entitled to treatment, rehabilitation, or other services which are required by law, (iv) family abuse has occurred and a protective order is being sought pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-253.4, or 16.1-279.1, or (v) an act of violence, force, or threat has occurred, a protective order is being sought pursuant to § 19.2-152.8, 19.2-152.9, or 19.2-152.10, and either the alleged victim or the respondent is a juvenile. If any such complainant does not file a petition, the intake officer may file it. In cases in which a child is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinquent, if the intake officer believes that probable cause does not exist, or that the authorization of a petition will not be in the best interest of the family or juvenile or that the matter may be effectively dealt with by some agency other than the court, he may refuse to authorize the filing of a petition. The intake officer shall provide to a person seeking a protective order pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-253.4, or 16.1-279.1 a written explanation of the conditions, procedures and time limits applicable to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-253.4, or 16.1-279.1. If the person is seeking a protective order pursuant to § 19.2-152.8, 19.2-152.9, or 19.2-152.10, the intake officer shall provide a written explanation of the conditions, procedures, and time limits applicable to the issuance of protective orders pursuant to § 19.2-152.8, 19.2-152.9, or 19.2-152.10.

       <li id="t16.1c11a05s16.1-260ol1D">
        Prior to the filing of any petition alleging that a child is in need of supervision, the matter shall be reviewed by an intake officer who shall determine whether the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need of supervision have utilized or attempted to utilize treatment and services available in the community and have exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial remedies which are available to them. When the intake officer determines that the parties have not attempted to utilize available treatment or services or have not exhausted all appropriate nonjudicial remedies which are available, he shall refer the petitioner and the child alleged to be in need of supervision to the appropriate agency, treatment facility, or individual to receive treatment or services, and a petition shall not be filed. Only after the intake officer determines that the parties have made a reasonable effort to utilize available community treatment or services may he permit the petition to be filed.

        If the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition relating to an offense that if committed by an adult would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor or as a felony, when such refusal is based solely upon a finding that no probable cause exists, the complainant shall be notified in writing at that time of the complainant's right to apply to a magistrate for a warrant. The application for a warrant to the magistrate shall be filed within 10 days of the issuance of the written notification. The written notification shall indicate that the intake officer made a finding that no probable cause exists and shall provide notice that the complainant has 10 days to apply for a warrant to the magistrate. The complainant shall provide the magistrate with a copy of the written notification upon application to the magistrate. If a magistrate determines that probable cause exists, he shall issue a warrant returnable to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. The warrant shall be delivered forthwith to the juvenile court, and the intake officer shall accept and file a petition founded upon the warrant. If the court is closed and the magistrate finds that the criteria for detention or shelter care set forth in § 16.1-248.1 have been satisfied, the juvenile may be detained pursuant to the warrant issued in accordance with this subsection. If the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition relating to a child in need of services or in need of supervision, a status offense, or a misdemeanor other than Class 1, his decision is final. If the intake officer refuses to authorize a petition relating to an offense that if committed by an adult would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor or as a felony when such refusal is based upon a finding that (i) probable cause exists, but that (ii) the matter is appropriate for diversion, his decision is final and the complainant shall not have a right to apply to a magistrate for a warrant.

A petition alleging that a juvenile committed a violent juvenile felony shall be filed with the court.

The intake officer may defer filing the petition and proceed informally by developing a truancy plan, provided that (1) the juvenile has not previously been proceeded against informally or adjudicated in need of supervision on more than two occasions for failure to comply with compulsory school attendance as provided in § 22.1-254 and (2) the immediately previous informal action or adjudication occurred at least three calendar years prior to the current complaint. The juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis must agree, in writing, for the development of a truancy plan. The truancy plan may include requirements that the juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis participate in such programs, cooperate in such treatment, or be subject to such conditions and limitations as necessary to ensure the juvenile's compliance with compulsory school attendance as provided in § 22.1-254. The intake officer may refer the juvenile to the appropriate public agency for the purpose of developing a truancy plan using an interagency interdisciplinary team approach. The team may include qualified personnel who are reasonably available from the appropriate department of social services, community services board, local school division, court service unit, and other appropriate and available public and private agencies and may be the family assessment and planning team established pursuant to <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.2.html#t2.2sIIp0Bc52s2.2-5207" target="_blank">§ 2.2-5207</a></cite>.

         This section, in pertinent part, requires filing of petition to invoke jurisdiction of juvenile court
        </b>
        and subsection F of this section does not waive the requirement of the filing of a petition but, rather, addresses the duties of the intake officer and the actions taken in regard to the petition. Rader v. Montgomery County Dep't of Social Servs., 5 Va. App. 523, 365 S.E.2d 234 (1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Separation of powers.
    </b>
    - Because juvenile intake officers exercise only a limited judicial function, and the juvenile and domestic relations district court retains actual control over the juveniles, the intake officer's authority to issue criminal petitions does not violate the separation of powers guaranteed by the Virginia Constitution. Roach v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">251 Va. 324</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 98, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 951, 117 S. Ct. 365, 136 L.

        <b>
     Procedural defects do not divest juvenile court of jurisdiction.
    </b>
    - Juvenile and domestic relations district court acted on a petition of the guardian ad litem, and therefore exercised jurisdiction over residential placement proceedings notwithstanding any latent procedural defect. Comprehensive Servs. Act Office v. J.M., No. 1620-98-2, 1999 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 473</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 3, 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court had jurisdiction to terminate the father's parental rights and approve the goal of adoption pursuant to the petitions filed by the Department and the failure so sign an affidavit did not divest the court of jurisdiction. Beim v. Roanoke Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0506-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 248</cite> (Sept. 25, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court had jurisdiction to terminate a mother's parental rights and approve the goal of adoption pursuant to the separate petitions filed by the county department of social services where the department filed the requisite foster care plans and the petitions for termination of parental rights, and the mother had notice of, and participated in, the foster care proceedings, including the hearings regarding the termination of her parental rights. Musolff v. Roanoke Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0521-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 247</cite> (Sept. 25, 2018).

     Designated nonattorney employees of the Department of Social Services.
    </b>
    - Circuit court properly affirmed the juvenile and domestic relations court's termination of the parties' parental rights because the lower courts acquired active jurisdiction to adjudicate the matters where, while the emergency removal and permanency planning petitions were not signed by an attorney, the 2008 and 2016 statutory amendments clearly demonstrated the General Assembly's express agreement that certain nonattorney employees of local departments of social services could complete, file, and sign form petitions and motions and would not invalidate prior filings or petitions. Rudolph v. City of Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., 67 Va. App. 140, 793 S.E.2d 831, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 355</cite> (2016).

     Proceeding seeking the issuance of a protective order.

    - Plea in bar was not proper in proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order because (1) a protective order was solely a creature of statute, (2) a plea in bar responded to a complaint, but a petition for a protective order was not a complaint, and (3) a protective order was not a cause of action.

     Settlement agreements.
    </b>
    - In proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order, it was error to sustain a plea in bar arguing a settlement agreement barred evidence of alleged abuse occurring before the agreement because the agreement did not affect the rights of the parties' children to a protective order, as the children were not parties to the agreement.

    - In proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order, it was error to sustain a plea in bar arguing a settlement agreement barred evidence of alleged abuse occurring before the agreement because the agreement did not affect the rights of the parties' children to a protective order, as the children were not parties to the agreement.

        After a petition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the juvenile, if the juvenile is twelve or more years of age, and another to at least one parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis, and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings.

        The summons shall advise the parties of their right to counsel as provided in § 16.1-266. A copy of the petition shall accompany each summons for the initial proceedings. The summons shall include notice that in the event that the juvenile is committed to the Department or to a secure local facility, at least one parent or other person legally obligated to care for and support the juvenile may be required to pay a reasonable sum for treatment of the juvenile pursuant to § 16.1-290. Notice of subsequent proceedings shall be provided to all parties in interest. In all cases where a party is represented by counsel and counsel has been provided with a copy of the petition and due notice as to time, date, and place of the hearing, such action shall be deemed due notice to such party, unless such counsel has notified the court that he no longer represents such party.

        No such summons or notification shall be required if the judge shall certify on the record that (i) the identity of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable or (ii) in cases in which it is alleged that a juvenile has committed a delinquent act, crime, status offense, or traffic infraction or is in need of services or supervision, the location, or in the case of a parent or guardian located outside of the Commonwealth the location or mailing address, of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit. In cases referred to in clause (ii), an affidavit of a law-enforcement officer or juvenile probation officer that the location of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided that there is no other evidence before the court which would refute the affidavit.

       Any such summons shall be deemed a mandate of the court, and willful failure to obey its requirements shall subject any person guilty thereof to liability for punishment for contempt.

        - Where juvenile court had address of defendant's mother but issued a summons to a different jurisdiction and later issued another summons at a time which made mother's timely arrival at transfer hearing impossible, transfer of jurisdiction over defendant from juvenile to circuit court was ineffectual and subsequent convictions were void.

    - Defendant's biological father was not his parent within the meaning of subsection A of this section as it read at the time of transfer proceedings and was not entitled to notice under this section, because an earlier final adoption order divested the defendant's biological parents of all legal rights with respect to him.

     Failure to serve father required reversal of conviction.
    </b>
    - Without either a certification on the record that the identity of a juvenile's father was not reasonably ascertainable or proof of service of a summons on the father by publication, the provisions of this section requiring service of process on the parents of a juvenile have not been met and noncompliance with these requirements necessitated reversal of the juvenile's conviction.See note below Baker v.

         Notice requirements must be met.
        </b>
        - The notice requirements of subsection E, requiring notice of juvenile proceedings to a child's parent, are jurisdictional rather than procedural and, more specifically, bear directly on whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a particular case, and failure to strictly adhere to the notice procedures results in the denial of a juvenile defendant's substantial right and constitutional guarantee of due process.

        Where father of defendant, a juvenile, was not notified of the juvenile or transfer proceedings that were initiated against defendant as required by former
        §

        </b>
        - The failure of a juvenile court to comply with statutory requirements of procedure, such as the notice requirements of this section, renders a certification to another court void, and any subsequent conviction in that court also void, and, since the notice requirement is considered to be jurisdictional, and particularly subject matter jurisdiction, it is not waivable despite the existence of waiver provisions. Commonwealth v. Carter, 54 Va. Cir. 230, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 583 (Norfolk 2000).

A subpoena may also be issued in a civil proceeding by an attorney-at-law who is an active member of the Virginia State Bar at the time of issuance, as an officer of the court. Any such subpoena shall be on a form approved by the Committee on District Courts, signed by the attorney as if a pleading and shall include the attorney's address. A copy, together with the attorney's certificate of service pursuant to Rule 1:12, shall be mailed or delivered to the clerk's office of the court in which the case is pending on the day of issuance by the attorney. The law governing subpoenas issued by a clerk shall apply mutatis mutandis, except that attorneys may not issue subpoenas in those cases in which they may not issue a summons as provided in <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-407" target="_blank">§ 8.01-407</a></cite>.

      <p>
       If the time for compliance with a subpoena issued by an attorney is less than 14 days after service of the subpoena, the person to whom it is directed may serve upon the party issuing the subpoena a written objection setting forth any grounds therefor. If objection is made, the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued and served shall not be entitled to compliance, except pursuant to an order of the court, but may, upon notice to the person to whom the subpoena was directed, move for an order to compel compliance. Upon such timely motion, the court may quash, modify or sustain the subpoena.

         Legislative intent.
        </b>
        - The General Assembly did not intend to require a circuit court to appoint a guardian ad item whenever the court issues a subpoena to compel a juvenile's testimony or where the circuit court initiates criminal contempt proceedings against the juvenile where juvenile is represented by counsel. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 318, 477 S.E.2d 7 (1996).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Purpose.
        </b>
        - This section is a prophylactic device designed to ensure that before a child and his parent or legal guardian waives assistance of counsel, the child understands the consequences of waiver and waiver is in the best interest of the child. Grogg v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 598, 371 S.E.2d 549 (1988).

        <b>
     Applicability.
    </b>
    - Trial court did not err in allowing the guardian ad litem to remain on the child custody case even after the mother appealed the decision of the juvenile and domestic relations district court awarding primary custody to the father to the trial court. The mother could not use subsection F of
    
     §
    
    16.1-266, which the mother cited, as a sword to remove the guardian ad litem. Lewis v. Hyman, No. 2133-07-4, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 281</cite> (June 10, 2008).

         Counsel not required where loss of parental rights not sought.
        </b>
        - A trial court erred in finding that counsel for the parents was required at the time of a hearing in which entrustment agreements were signed by the children's aunt and approved by the juvenile and domestic relations court, because no petition for termination of parental rights was either filed or pending at that time and, therefore, neither parent could be subjected to the loss of residual rights and responsibilities at the time of that hearing.

    - That statutory mandate, to inquire as to financial ability to pay guardian ad litem fees as required by
    
     §
    
    16.1-267 A applies only to a guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to subsection A or B of this section.

     Reimbursement by parents of guardian ad litem fee.
    </b>
    - Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a mother to pay one-half of a guardian ad litem's fee, where the evidence presented demonstrated that the guardian was appointed to protect the interests of the children and favorably addressed an issue related to the mother's successful treatment for depression.

     Substantive rights and interests of child.
    </b>
    - This section recognizes that the substantive rights and interests of the child are often separate and distinct from those of the other parties to the litigation, and that these rights and interests are best protected by an independent party.

     Failure to appoint counsel for child.
    </b>
    - In a termination of parental rights case, it was not an abuse of discretion not to appoint counsel for the subject child, in addition to the child's guardian ad litem, because (1) it was not alleged that the guardian ad litem did not comply with Va. Sup. Ct. R. 8:6, (2) the guardian ad litem disclosed the child's desire to live with the child's family, contrary to the guardian ad litem's position, and (3) the child so testified. Tackett v.

        In a termination of parental rights case in which the mother was a 16-year-old minor, the trial court did not err by dismissing the mother's appeal because, contrary to mother's assertions, the trial court was not required to appoint a guardian ad litem for the mother as she was represented by counsel; it was within the trial court's discretion whether to appoint a guardian ad litem; and it was within the trial court's discretion to appoint an attorney and a guardian ad litem to represent a parent involved in an abuse or neglect case or a termination of parental rights matter.

    - Trial court was authorized to allow the guardian ad litem to remain on the child custody case despite the mother seeking to remove the guardian ad litem after appealing an adverse decision from the juvenile and domestic relations district court to the trial court. This section authorized a properly appointed guardian ad litem to remain on such a case, and the mother did not show that the guardian ad litem was not properly appointed. Lewis v.

         - In effect, if not intent, this section and
         §
         16.1-241 provide a chance for different, less rigorous treatment for certain persons whose immaturity at the time of the offense works not only to make special rehabilitation efforts more fitting but also decreases the moral blame attached to the act, and the punishment flowing from it.

          Effect of 1990 amendment.
         </b>
         - A de novo hearing is required under subsection E of this section on the issue of transfer and the 1990 amendment to this section did not do away with the de novo hearing requirement, but merely prohibited the circuit court from redetermining the juvenile court's finding of probable cause.

        <p>
         <b>
     A juvenile is entitled to the protection of the juvenile system
    </b>
    and the Commonwealth can only try the juvenile as an adult if the requirements for juvenile transfer proceedings under this section have been strictly followed; for without such an approach, there may be grounds for concern that the child receives the worst of both worlds: that he gets neither the protections accorded to adults nor the solicitous care and regenerative treatment postulated for children. In re Baskins, 16 Va. App. 241, 430 S.E.2d 555 (1993), but see Jamborsky v. Baskins, <cite class="va_code">247 Va. 506</cite>, 442 S.E.2d 636 (1994).

     Indictment in circuit court cures failure to notify biological father.
    </b>
    - The failure to notify a defendant's biological father of the initiation of juvenile proceedings was a defect but, under this section, that defect was cured when the grand jury returned indictments against the defendant on the offenses certified to it by the juvenile court and this section permitted the circuit court to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction and to try the defendant on the offenses set forth in the indictments. Moore v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">259 Va. 405</cite>, 527 S.E.2d 415 (2000), rev'd on other grounds, Pope v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 451, 559 S.E.2d 388 (2002).

          Review of juvenile court record in making determination on transfer issue.
         </b>
         - The critical requirement is that the circuit court make an independent determination on the issue of transfer but it is permissible for the circuit court to review the transcripts and written records from the juvenile court. Grogg v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 598, 371 S.E.2d 549 (1988).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     No appeal of transfer decision.
    </b>
    - Trial court properly denied a juvenile's motion to quash the indictments because, while the trial court found substantial compliance with the transfer statute and advised the Commonwealth's attorney that he could seek an indictment, the court was not required to do so as the transfer decision had not been appealed. Waters v. Commonwealth, No. 1092-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 175</cite> (July 3, 2018).

          Cameras in courtroom.
         </b>
         - Once a juvenile is transferred to the circuit court pursuant to this section, he is thereafter prosecuted as an adult. In such circumstances, a decision to permit cameras in the courtroom rests with the sound discretion of the trial court, and absent a showing of prejudice of constitutional dimensions, the mere presence of cameras does not result in an unfair trial.

          Waiver based solely on seriousness of offense contemplated.

         - It would strain reason to hold that a juvenile is not afforded the right to a different circuit judge at an adjudicatory hearing following appeal of the transfer to circuit court, when the juvenile has that right pursuant to specific language in subsection D for the identical proceeding in juvenile court, and in subsection E for the identical proceeding in circuit court incident to the Commonwealth's appeal; therefore, the circuit court erred in failing to follow the procedure in this section for transfer hearings by denying defendant his right to a different judge at the adjudicatory hearing.

         <b>
          All constitutional rights of adult need not be available to juvenile.
         </b>
         - The United States Supreme Court has never held that all rights constitutionally assured to an adult accused of crime also are to be enforced or made available to the juvenile in his delinquency proceeding. Brown v. Cox, 481 F.2d 622 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1136, 94 S. Ct. 881, 38 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1976).

         <b>
          Test.
         </b>
         - The United States Supreme Court has enunciated the test for ascertaining to what extent constitutional requirements are to be "superimposed" on the juvenile process. That test is a two-fold one, namely, whether the application of the right is necessary to the achievement of "fundamental fairness" and whether it will disrupt the juvenile court system. Brown v. Cox, 481 F.2d 622 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1136, 94 S. Ct. 881, 38 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1976).

          Due process.
         </b>
         - The juvenile hearing need not conform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing, but it must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment. Cradle v. Cox, 327 F. Supp. 1169 (E.D. Va. 1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Juvenile waiver of jurisdiction hearings requires basic elements of procedural due process, including a hearing, effective assistance of counsel and a statement of reasons. The procedures under this section generally provide appropriate constitutional safeguards. Wansley v. Miller, 353 F. Supp. 42 (E.D. Va.), rev'd on other grounds, 487 F.2d 90 (4th Cir. 1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         A juvenile is entitled to the assistance of counsel in having a court of proper jurisdiction determine, upon proper facts, whether he should be tried and sentenced as a juvenile. Cradle v. Cox, 327 F. Supp. 1169 (E.D. Va. 1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Juvenile charged with first degree murder was barred from claiming a deprivation of due process for not being allowed a preliminary hearing before being transferred for prosecution as an adult because this section did not mandate a preliminary hearing prior to a dismissal of the charges in juvenile court. Lampkins v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 709, 607 S.E.2d 722, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 22</cite> (2005).

         There was no reversible error in denying defendant's appeal of the order of the juvenile court certifying the charges against defendant to the grand jury pursuant to subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-269.1, because, while defendant's parents were not provided with notification of the advisement hearing or the transfer hearing, there was no violation of defendant's constitutional due process rights because no such rights exist with regard to non-adjudicatory hearings. Angel v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">281 Va. 248</cite>, 704 S.E.2d 386, 2011 Va. LEXIS 26 (2011), cert. denied, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 7091, 132 S. Ct. 344, 181 L. Ed. 2d 216 (U.S. 2011).

         <b>
     Violation of speedy trial statute.
    </b>
    - When the district court certified and transferred defendant for trial as an adult in the circuit court, the district court necessarily found the requisite probable cause contemplated by the speedy trial statute. Because the transfer order directed that defendant be "remanded to jail," the prescribed five month limitation of
    
     §
    
    19.2-243 commenced on October 4, 1995. It was immaterial that such custody coincided with detention of defendant incidental to an unrelated commitment. Irrespective of the trial court's order to quash, the initial indictments of defendant were a nullity, obtained without the benefit of the enabling order required by subsection B of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    16.1-269.6, and the court simply remedied of record an error or oversight in the proceedings, without disturbing the legal efficacy of the pending transfer order or effecting a nolle prosequi. Accordingly, defendant was held continuously in custody from the finding of probable cause in the district court on October 4, 1995, until trial on July 11, 1996, in violation of Section 19.2-243, and the court had to reverse and dismiss the convictions. Price v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 655, 492 S.E.2d 447 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="va_code">256 Va. 373</cite>, 506 S.E.2d 317 (1998).

    - Juvenile court's certification to the grand jury of the murder charge filed against defendant, a 14-year-old, did not violate defendant's constitutional rights even though defendant was not granted a transfer hearing as no constitutional right existed to a transfer hearing and the juvenile court had made the required statutory findings that defendant was 14 years old or older and probable cause existed to believe defendant committed the murder at issue.

     Scope of hearing.
    </b>
    - A hearing held under the Juvenile and Domestic Relations (District) Court Law is not as limited in its scope as a preliminary hearing under the criminal procedures applicable to an adult. The juvenile court judge is expressly empowered with the discretion of either retaining jurisdiction of the child charged with the commission of a felony or certifying the child for criminal proceedings in a proper court of record. Peyton v. French, <cite class="va_code">207 Va. 73</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 739 (1966).

         <b>
          Distinction between transfer and adjudicatory proceedings.
         </b>
         - Distinction should be made for double jeopardy purposes between the transfer or certification proceeding and an adjudicatory or dispositional proceeding. A confinement order "imposes a sentence of confinement" and will constitute jeopardy. On the other hand, a certification order transfers the case to another court for original determination whether the accused child shall be confined. In such order, the court makes no finding of innocence or guilt, only a finding that the juvenile should stand trial on the merits in another court. Brown v. Cox, 481 F.2d 622 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1136, 94 S. Ct. 881, 38 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1976).

         Juvenile's indictment in circuit court cured any defect that may have occurred in his transfer proceedings in juvenile and domestic relations district court. Ballard v. Commonwealth, No. 0075-99-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 21, 2000).

         Although defendant juvenile timely raised her objection to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, once the grand jury returned an indictment, the alleged defects in the transfer proceedings from the juvenile court to the circuit court were cured by the indictment; also, because any procedural errors in the appeal were cured by the indictment, the circuit court was not in any manner divested of its jurisdiction to try defendant on the charges set forth in the indictment. Thus, the circuit court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over the felony charges against defendant. Overdorff v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 222, 609 S.E.2d 626, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va.

     Confession of juvenile prior to certification and transfer.
    </b>
    - If a juvenile has been fully advised of his constitutional rights, and it is apparent from the totality of the circumstances that a criminal prosecution might follow, his confession, if freely and voluntarily made, is admissible in a criminal trial in a circuit court notwithstanding the confession was made prior to certification and transfer of the juvenile case by the juvenile and domestic relations district court.

    as a result of the three-day delay in the circuit court's assumption of jurisdiction over his felony charges; in fact, at oral argument in this appeal, his counsel acknowledged that the 21-day requirement is procedural in that it does not convey a substantive right, and that the defendant did not suffer even minor prejudice because of the delay.

     Defects in juvenile court cured by indictment.
    </b>
    - Under the plain language of this statute, an indictment by a grand jury cures any defect or error, except one regarding a juvenile's age, which has occurred in any juvenile court proceeding. Ballard v. Commonwealth, No. 0075-99-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 21, 2000).

        <p>
         Assuming that, in addition to notifying a juvenile's legal custodian, the Commonwealth was required to notify both of the juvenile's biological parents of the commencement of proceedings, any failure to do so was cured when the grand jury returned indictments on the charges against him.

          Each case considered on own facts in determining remedy.
         </b>
         - While ordinarily a reconstructed transfer hearing is the appropriate remedy where a prior transfer order of the juvenile court has been invalidated on procedural due process grounds and the juvenile court has lost jurisdiction of the defendant by reason of his age, each case must be considered on its own facts, and, if some other remedy or determination will not result in fundamental unfairness to the petitioner and is more appropriate under the facts of the case and will contribute to a more expeditious resolution of the issue, that procedure should be adopted. Brown v. Cox, 481 F.2d 622 (4th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1136, 94 S. Ct. 881, 38 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1976).

     Certification of lesser offense not bar to indictment for greater offense.
    </b>
    - Even if it was assumed that the juvenile court found the evidence insufficient to establish probable cause to believe a defendant committed a more serious offense and intended to certify a lesser offense to the grand jury, the Commonwealth was free to proceed by direct indictment for the original offense, notwithstanding such order. Nelson v. Commonwealth, No. 0283-99-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 245</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 4, 2000).

         - Testimony of deputy clerk of the circuit court as to date of receipt of case from juvenile court did not impeach the accuracy of the record but, rather, established a fact not evident on the face of the record therefore the date of the receipt of the juvenile court case by the circuit court was properly a part of the record in the proceedings to determine whether request to have juvenile be prosecuted as an adult was timely.

    - When defendant sought de novo review in the circuit court of the order of the juvenile court transferring his prosecution for arson and related offenses to the circuit court, the record showed the circuit court properly conducted such a review by holding a hearing and taking substantial evidence on the issue, before finding defendant was not a proper person to remain within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.

     Defects in transfer to Circuit Court cured.
    </b>
    - Although defendant juvenile timely raised her objection to the jurisdiction of the circuit court, once the grand jury returned an indictment, the alleged defects in the transfer proceedings from the juvenile court to the circuit court were cured by the indictment; also, because any procedural errors in the appeal were cured by the indictment, the circuit court was not in any manner divested of its jurisdiction to try defendant on the charges set forth in the indictment. Thus, the circuit court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over the felony charges against defendant. Overdorff v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 222, 609 S.E.2d 626, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va.

     Return to juvenile court no longer required.
    </b>
    - The nolle prosequi in the instant case did not have the same effect as it would have if decided under the old statute. Under the new statute, the circuit court retains jurisdiction and the Commonwealth may, as it did, seek new indictments without having to return to the juvenile court. Dara v. Commonwealth, No. 2795-95-1, 1997 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 11, 1997).

        <b>
     Violation of speedy trial statute.
    </b>
    - When the district court certified and transferred defendant for trial as an adult in the circuit court, the district court necessarily found the requisite probable cause contemplated by the speedy trial statute. Because the transfer order directed that defendant be "remanded to jail," the prescribed five month limitation of Section 19.2-243 commenced on October 4, 1995. It was immaterial that such custody coincided with detention of defendant incidental to an unrelated commitment. Irrespective of the trial court's order to quash, the initial indictments of defendant were a nullity, obtained without the benefit of the enabling order required by subsection B, and the court simply remedied of record an error or oversight in the proceedings, without disturbing the legal efficacy of the pending transfer order or effecting a nolle prosequi. Accordingly, defendant was held continuously in custody from the finding of probable cause in the district court on October 4, 1995, until trial on July 11, 1996, in violation of
    
     §
    
    19.2-243, and the court had to reverse and dismiss the convictions. Price v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 655, 492 S.E.2d 447 (1997), aff'd, <cite class="va_code">256 Va. 373</cite>, 506 S.E.2d 317 (1998).

    - The plain language of this section clearly manifests legislative intent that any defect in the transfer proceedings conducted in the juvenile court as provided in this article is waived unless the juvenile raises an objection based on a defect in the juvenile court transfer hearing prior to arraignment in the circuit court. It is beyond question that the legislature has the authority to provide for a waiver of a defect in the transfer proceeding in this manner. Moore v.

    - A juvenile who has been convicted as an adult in circuit court under the provisions of this article is not entitled to a transfer hearing in juvenile court for any pending unrelated allegations of delinquency which have not been disposed of by the juvenile court at the time of the criminal conviction. A prior conviction in the circuit court for unrelated offenses precludes the juvenile court from thereafter exercising jurisdiction regardless of the defendant's age at the time of the institution of the proceedings.

     Probable cause finding divested juvenile court of jurisdiction for future offenses.
    </b>
    - Defendant juvenile, tried as an adult on a charge of malicious wounding and convicted of the lesser included offense of unlawful wounding, could not have the case transferred back to the juvenile court, as once the juvenile court made a probable cause finding, the juvenile court had no further jurisdiction; the juvenile court was also precluded from taking jurisdiction subsequent offenses committed by that juvenile, pursuant to

        <b>
     Applicability of statute.
    </b>
    - Section 16.1-271 was not applicable because the events giving rise to defendant's prior convictions occurred chronologically after the shooting of the victim, so that the shooting of the victim was not an alleged future criminal act. Furthermore, the charges against defendant for the victim's shooting were not pending at the time of defendant's prior convictions. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 63 Va.

     Prior conviction as adult renders transfer procedures inapplicable.
    </b>
    - A defendant's argument that original indictments were void because the circuit court failed to review the transfer record from the juvenile court as required by statute before the indictments were obtained was without merit because the defendant previously had been tried and convicted as an adult in another circuit court for rape and such prior conviction as an adult eliminated the requirement that the circuit court review the transfer proceedings.

     Juvenile procedures inapplicable to subsequent offense.
    </b>
    - Where the defendant had previously been tried as an adult and convicted of a rape which occurred several days before the rape and capital murder with which he was presently charged, the later rape and capital murder constituted "alleged future criminal acts" for purposes of this section and rendered inapplicable the procedures for transferring a case so that a juvenile may be charged as an adult and for giving notice to the juvenile's parents. Johnson v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">259 Va. 654</cite>, 529 S.E.2d 769, 2000 Va. LEXIS 60, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 981, 121 S. Ct. 432, 148 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2000).

     Failure to challenge certification in other proceeding.
    </b>
    - Because the defendant failed to raise the jurisdictional issue of lack of notice to his father when he was certified for trial as an adult in another county before the indictments were returned in the circuit court in the instant case, failure to comply with the parental notification provisions of the statutes did not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction in the instant case.

     Sentencing by a jury.
    </b>
    - The fact that a defendant was convicted as an adult of crimes committed when he was a juvenile after he had previously been convicted of another crime as an adult did not mean he was entitled to be sentenced by a jury. The offenses for which he was to be sentenced occurred before the offense of which he had previously been convicted as an adult and were not, therefore, "future criminal acts," nor were they the subject of delinquency allegations pending in the juvenile court at the time of his first conviction as an adult. Ingram v. Commonwealth, No. 1791-01-1, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 593</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 8, 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury sentencing was proper in a minor defendant's adult trial because
    
     §

        When defendant appeared before a circuit court for sentencing on criminal charges under
    
     §
    
    16.1-269.1, the jury was correctly allowed to sentence defendant because he was not a juvenile in that he had been previously convicted as an adult on an unrelated charge and given an adult sentence. Section 16.1-272 did not apply to youthful offenders who fell within the scope of

     Rational basis exists for different sentencing procedure for juveniles.

    - A rational basis does exist for the classification under which sentences of adults are fixed by juries but sentences of juveniles transferred to the circuit court are fixed by the judge. While, for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence, a transferred juvenile is treated as an adult, and although he may be subject to adult penalties in the sentencing phase of his case, this section permits a circuit court to treat him in all respects as a juvenile, with the full panoply of beneficent alternatives available in juvenile court, including the use of a juvenile probation officer.

    - In enacting this section, the General Assembly obviously opted for judge-sentencing for transferred juveniles because it perceived the inability of juries to adequately comprehend the differences in the sentencing of a juvenile defendant as an adult, and the treatment of that same child within the framework of the juvenile court laws.

    - Defendant juvenile, tried as an adult on a charge of malicious wounding and convicted of the lesser included offense of unlawful wounding, could not have the case transferred back to the juvenile court, as once the juvenile court made a probable cause finding, the juvenile court had no further jurisdiction; the trial court had express authority to impose sentence on defendant, under subsection A of
    
     §

     Discretion of court.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a juvenile was properly certified to a court of record in connection with offenses committed when he was sixteen and thereafter was tried as an adult when he was seventeen, there was no merit in the contention that the trial court erred in not trying him as a juvenile. It was not shown that there was abuse of the discretion given the court of record by this section. Holt v. City of Richmond, <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 364</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 394 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 917, 84 S. Ct. 672, 11 L. Ed. 2d 613 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, a juvenile who was certified to be tried as adult, was properly sentenced to an adult facility because, his assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, the trial court was aware of its authority to allow him to serve part of his sentence in a juvenile facility; it simply elected not to do so.

        Circuit court's revocation of defendant's previously suspended sentence of incarceration in the Tennessee Department of Corrections was a proper exercise of both its discretion to impose conditions and to revoke a suspended sentence.

    - Trial court lacked authority to modify a sentencing order because the court's order to vacate, which was entered more than twenty-one days after the original sentencing order, came too late under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, and the court lacked jurisdiction to enter the second order because the original order was not void. McClease v. Commonwealth, No. 2209-13-1, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va.

     Preparation and filing of reports.
    </b>
    - Statutory law permitted court-appointed special advocate to submit to the court a written report of the advocate's investigation into what was best for the child's welfare in a proceeding to terminate parental rights and directed the advocate to file that report with the clerk of the court directing the investigation, and, thus, the trial court did not err in admitting that report into evidence; accordingly, the father's objection that the report violated the hearsay rule had to be rejected.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The juvenile court or the circuit court may cause any juvenile within its jurisdiction under the provisions of this law to be physically examined and treated by a physician or to be examined and treated at a local mental health center. If no such appropriate facility is available locally, the court may order the juvenile to be examined and treated by any physician or psychiatrist or examined by a clinical psychologist. The Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall provide for distribution a list of appropriate mental health centers available throughout the Commonwealth. Upon the written recommendation of the person examining the juvenile that an adequate evaluation of the juvenile's treatment needs can only be performed in an inpatient hospital setting, the court shall have the power to send any such juvenile to a state mental hospital for not more than 10 days for the purpose of obtaining a recommendation for the treatment of the juvenile. No juvenile sent to a state mental hospital pursuant to this provision shall be held or cared for in any maximum security unit where adults determined to be criminally insane reside; the juvenile shall be kept separate and apart from such adults. However, the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services may place a juvenile who has been certified to the circuit court for trial as an adult pursuant to § 16.1-269.6 or 16.1-270 or who has been convicted as an adult of a felony in the circuit court in a unit appropriate for the care and treatment of persons under a criminal charge when, in his discretion, such placement is necessary to protect the security or safety of other patients, staff or the public.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the parent or other person responsible for the care and support of a juvenile is determined by the court to be financially unable to pay the costs of such examination as ordered by the juvenile court or the circuit court, such costs may be paid according to procedures and rates adopted by the Department from funds appropriated in the general appropriation act for the Department.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The juvenile court or the circuit court may cause any juvenile within its jurisdiction who is found to be delinquent for an offense that is eligible for commitment pursuant to subdivision A 14 of § 16.1-278.8 or § 16.1-285.1 to be placed in the temporary custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice for a period of time not to exceed 30 days for diagnostic assessment services after the adjudicatory hearing and prior to final disposition of his or her case. Prior to such a placement, the Department shall determine that the personnel, services and space are available in the appropriate correctional facility for the care, supervision and study of such juvenile and that the juvenile's case is appropriate for referral for diagnostic services.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever a juvenile concerning whom a petition has been filed appears to be in need of nursing, medical or surgical care, the juvenile court or the circuit court may order the parent or other person responsible for the care and support of the juvenile to provide such care in a hospital or otherwise and to pay the expenses thereof. If the parent or other person is unable or fails to provide such care, the juvenile court or the circuit court may refer the matter to the authority designated in accordance with law for the determination of eligibility for such services in the county or city in which such juvenile or his parents have residence or legal domicile.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In any such case, if a parent who is able to do so fails or refuses to comply with the order, the juvenile court or the circuit court may proceed against him as for contempt or may proceed against him for nonsupport.

     §
    
    16.1-278.2 was without merit because that code section only limited the duration of a protective order excluding from the home parents or other adults living in the same dwelling with the abused child, and at the time the order was entered, the father was no longer living in the same home as the child; further, the five-year limitation on visitation was clearly within the trial court's discretion as appropriate to protect the child's life, health, and normal development, pursuant to

         Factors rebutting presumption that custody of parent serves best interests.
        </b>
        - The law presumes that the child's best interests will be served when in the custody of its parent unless that presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence of certain facts. These factors are: (1) parental unfitness; (2) a previous order of divestiture; (3) voluntary relinquishment; (4) abandonment; and (5) special facts and circumstances constituting an extraordinary reason for taking a child from its parent. Ferris v. Underwood, 3 Va. App. 25, 348 S.E.2d 18 (1986).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Consideration of less drastic alternatives.
    </b>
    - The trial court properly did not place the child at issue with other relatives, rather than terminating the mother's parental rights, where the social services district explored placement with other relatives, but found such placement to be unavailable or unadvisable, and the mother's past behavior did not demonstrate a strong potential for rehabilitation. Gentry v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Social Services Dist., No. 1340-97-3, 1998 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ct. of Appeals March 17, 1998).

         Continuation to allow further services to parent.
        </b>
        - In addition to statutorily created alternatives to termination of residual parental rights, the trial court may use its discretion to continue a case on its docket in order to allow further services to be rendered to a parent in the hope that termination of the parent's residual parental rights would not be necessary. Edwards v. County of Arlington, 5 Va. App. 294, 361 S.E.2d 644 (1987).

        <b>
         Finality in litigation
        </b>
        is only one of the factors used in determining a child's best interests. Since circumstances affecting a child's best interests may change periodically, finality is not a paramount consideration. Concerns for finality particularly diminish in comparison to concerns that a child may be at risk of being abused or neglected by a parent or custodian who has been adjudicated as having abused or neglected another child in the care of the parent or custodian. Whether a child custody disposition should be reopened is, therefore, determined by the child's best interests. Accomack County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Muslimani, 12 Va. App. 220, 403 S.E.2d 1 (1991).

        <b>
     Dispositional hearings.
    </b>
    - Mother's contention that the trial court erred by issuing dispositional orders without conducting separate dispositional hearings was rejected because she failed to show that there were no dispositional hearings, as the record showed that the trial court scheduled March 2, 2020, to make both determinations and then held both adjudicatory and dispositional hearings during the March 2 proceeding.

        in which the father, who admitted to having sexual relations with his 11-year-old stepdaughter, was awarded custody of three minor children; the motion to reopen the hearing was based on an affidavit by a psychiatrist which bore directly on the children's best interest, the credibility of the testimony relied upon by the trial court in the original hearing and the correctness of the earlier order.

     Waiver.
    </b>
    - Because a parent did not appeal the juvenile and domestic relations district court's dispositional order to the circuit court, the parent waived any argument regarding the finding of abuse or neglect.

    16.1-278.2 D, 16.1-252, and 16.1-296 A provided that a preliminary removal order was not a dispositional order and was not a final order, the trial court did not err in finding that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain a department of social services' appeal of a juvenile court's order. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2261-05-2, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 263</cite> (June 13, 2006).

     Appeals to circuit court.
    </b>
    - Circuit court did not err in dismissing a mother's appeals of a juvenile and domestic relations district court's adjudicatory orders that her children were abused and neglected because the juvenile and domestic relations district court's dispositional orders, the final orders, were not entered until July 16, 2010, but the mother never appealed those orders, and the filing of the dispositional order appeal forms on June 1, 2010, was premature since there were no final orders from which the mother could appeal at that time; pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-296, only final orders of the district court could be appealed to the circuit court, and adjudicatory orders entered by a district court in child abuse and neglect cases are not final orders for purposes of appeal because they are not entered pursuant to

    16.1-278.2 as required by the General Assembly. Chavis v. Hopewell Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1762-10-2, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 118</cite> (Apr. 5, 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of appeals was not procedurally empowered to correct the error a mother alleged in her assignment of error because her opportunity to contest the finding of abuse or neglect had long since passed; in dispositional orders, the juvenile and domestic relations district court transferred custody of the children to the Department of Human Services, but the mother did not exercise her right to appeal those dispositional orders. Dilaura v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0223-17-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 289</cite> (Nov. 21, 2017).

       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear a mother's appeal because the circuit court's orders, that her children were abused or neglected or were at risk of abuse or neglect, were not final orders where the orders were adjudicatory in nature, did not make any of the seven statutory dispositions, and did not make any final determinations regarding custody.

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Findings not required.
    </b>
    - Circuit court was not required to make findings pursuant to subsection A1 and could not have erred in failing to do so because no "transfer" to a "relative" took place since the children remained with their fathers; the circuit court ordered that custody remain with the children's biological fathers, which was not a "transfer" of custody, and the children's fathers were not "relatives." Gerald v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0918-18-2, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 62</cite> (Mar. 19, 2019).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Evidence sufficient to find child abused and neglected.
    </b>
    - As the evidence established a mother either abandoned her 19-month-old daughter at her apartment building despite her neighbors' refusal to be responsible for the child, or she left the child with a person who was unable to remember she had agreed to care for the child, left the child with no provisions or emergency contact information, and did not return at the time she promised, the juvenile court properly found that the mother's irresponsible behavior rendered the child abused and neglected. MacLean v. Roanoke County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1789-07-3, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 37</cite> (Jan. 22, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly entered a child protective order against a father that "required sight and sound visitation" because the father's untreated mental health situation endangered the child, especially considering the father's actions toward his own dog - slicing its neck - after the child's paternal great uncle and wife asked him to leave and it was unfair for a child to carry the responsibility of maintaining the stability of the father's behavior.

     Sufficient evidence to support transfer of child to grandparent.
    </b>
    - Public agency presented sufficient evidence to support transferring physical custody of a child, who had been abused and neglected, to a grandparent because the child's parent did not show the ability to care for the child, while the child's health and performance at school improved under the grandparent's care. Moreover, the court imposed appropriate conditions for the care of the child and preserved the parent's parental rights until the parent could demonstrate long-term change in the parent's parenting and living circumstances.

    </b>
    - Circuit court properly dismissed a grandfather's petitions for custody of his grandsons because, inter alia, the court considered the four statutory factors and found that the grandfather did not establish that he was willing or qualified to care for the grandsons or that he was willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with them, the living arrangement proposed by the grandfather was not suitable considering the grandsons' profound needs and a recommendation that they live separately, the grandfather did not establish that he could protect the grandsons from abuse and neglect, and the the grandfather's "barrier crimes" did not bar the court from placing the grandsons with him.

         Foster care plan rejected.
        </b>
        - Court rejected a juvenile court's approval of a foster care plan with respect to a father's daughter as the plan's goal of relative placement instead of return to parent was not supported by the evidence within the meaning of
        §§
        16.1-278.2 and 16.1-281 and was not in the daughter's best interest. However, since the daughter had been in foster care for seven months and her relationship with her father was very strained, the court postponed the entry of an order for fifteen business days, giving the interested parties time to respond.

     Commitment for probation violation.
    </b>
    - Because defendant juvenile did not provide a transcript or refer to it in the appellate brief, as required by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:8(b) and 5A:20(c), the appellate court was unable to consider whether the proper underlying offense was present to commit defendant to the Department of Juvenile Justice. Williams v.

     Commitment for probation violation improper.
    </b>
    - Because the plain language of subdivision A 14 of this section bars the commitment of a juvenile absent a delinquency finding on either a felony or a second Class 1 misdemeanor, a probation violation is insufficient to commit a juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice. Salvatierra v. City of Falls Church, 35 Va. App. 453, 546 S.E.2d 214, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 265</cite> (2001).

        <b>
     Commitment to Department of Juvenile Justice.
    </b>
    - Trial court did not err in finding, upon determining that the juvenile violated the juvenile's probation, that the juvenile should be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period; although the juvenile argued that the "original disposition" and "current offense" for such a disposition had to be a felony or Class 1 misdemeanor and the juvenile's case merely involved a probation violation, the underlying offense on which the juvenile received probation was a felony robbery, and, thus, commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice was permissible because it could have been made in originally deciding the juvenile's punishment even though the juvenile's proceeding was indeed a probation revocation proceeding. Kerns v. Commonwealth, No. 0230-06-4, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 175</cite> (May 1, 2007).

     §§
    
    16.1-278.8 and 16.1-291 to impose a suspended Department of Juvenile Justice commitment upon defendant juvenile's violation of the conditions of his probation because defendant's underlying offense, larceny of animals, was a form of grand larceny, and it remained a felony each time defendant came before the trial court on a probation violation; the term, "original disposition" in subsection B of

        - Statute authorizes the chief judge of a juvenile and domestic relations district court to order that local law-enforcement personnel shall be responsible for transporting violent and disruptive juveniles to court-ordered out-of-state destinations; when a local law-enforcement officer is transporting a prisoner in another state, he has only such law-enforcement authority over the prisoner as may be provided by the laws of that state.

     ICE detainer is merely a request.
    </b>
    - It does not create for a law enforcement agency either an obligation or legal authority to maintain custody of a prisoner who is otherwise eligible for immediate release from local or state custody. For that reason, an adult inmate or a juvenile inmate with a fixed release date should be released from custody on that date notwithstanding the agency's receipt of an ICE detainer. If a juvenile is being held pursuant to an indeterminate commitment, the Department of Juvenile Justice may exercise its discretion to hold the juvenile until ICE officials assume custody, provided the Department does not hold the juvenile longer than thirty-six continuous months or past his twenty-first birthday.

Discharge and dismissal under these provisions shall be without an adjudication of guilt but a record of the proceeding shall be retained for the purpose of applying this section in subsequent proceedings.

      <p>
       The court, in its discretion and upon a demonstration of hardship, may authorize the use of a restricted permit to operate a motor vehicle by any child who has a driver's license at the time of the offense or at the time of the court's finding as provided in subsection A1 or A2 for any of the purposes set forth in subsection E of § 18.2-271.1 or for travel to and from school, except that no restricted license shall be issued for travel to and from home and school when school-provided transportation is available and no restricted license shall be issued if the finding as to such child involves a violation designated under clause (iii) or (iv) of subsection A, or if it involves a second or subsequent violation of any offense designated in subsection A, a second finding by the court of failure to comply with school attendance and meeting requirements as provided in subsection A1, or a second or subsequent finding by the court of a refusal to take a blood test as provided in subsection A2. The issuance of the restricted permit shall be set forth within the court order, a copy of which shall be provided to the child, and shall specifically enumerate the restrictions imposed and contain such information regarding the child as is reasonably necessary to identify him. The child may operate a motor vehicle under the court order in accordance with its terms. Any child who operates a motor vehicle in violation of any restrictions imposed pursuant to this section is guilty of a violation of § 46.2-301.

         License suspension.

        - Court-imposed penalties for traffic infractions were penal in nature and served to deter and punish drivers who violated the rules of the road, while an administrative license suspension by the Commissioner was primarily remedial in nature and was a reflection of the legislature's concern for young drivers and the public safety. Thus, the juvenile's petition to have the court review the suspension of her operator's license was denied because there was no conflict between the permitted punishment that could be imposed by the court and the administrative action of the Commissioner.

        In cases involving the custody, visitation or support of a child pursuant to subdivision A 3 of § 16.1-241, the court may make any order of disposition to protect the welfare of the child and family as may be made by the circuit court. The parties to any petition where a child whose custody, visitation, or support is contested shall show proof that they have attended within the 12 months prior to their court appearance or that they shall attend within 45 days thereafter an educational seminar or other like program conducted by a qualified person or organization approved by the court. The court may require the parties to attend such seminar or program in uncontested cases only if the court finds good cause. The seminar or other program shall be a minimum of four hours in length and shall address the effects of separation or divorce on children, parenting responsibilities, options for conflict resolution and financial responsibilities. Once a party has completed one educational seminar or other like program, the required completion of additional programs shall be at the court's discretion. Parties under this section shall include natural or adoptive parents of the child, or any person with a legitimate interest as defined in § 20-124.1. The fee charged a party for participation in such program shall be based on the party's ability to pay; however, no fee in excess of $50 may be charged. Whenever possible, before participating in mediation or alternative dispute resolution to address custody, visitation or support, each party shall have attended the educational seminar or other like program. The court may grant an exemption from attendance of such program for good cause shown or if there is no program reasonably available. Other than statements or admissions by a party admitting criminal activity or child abuse or neglect, no statement or admission by a party in such seminar or program shall be admissible into evidence in any subsequent proceeding. If support is ordered for a child, the order shall also provide that support will continue to be paid for a child over the age of 18 who is (i) a full-time high school student, (ii) not self-supporting, and (iii) living in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support, until the child reaches the age of 19 or graduates from high school, whichever occurs first. The court may also order that support be paid or continue to be paid for any child over the age of 18 who is (a) severely and permanently mentally or physically disabled, and such disability existed prior to the child reaching the age of 18 or the age of 19 if the child met the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii); (b) unable to live independently and support himself; and (c) residing in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support. Upon request of either party, the court may also order that support payments be made to a special needs trust or an ABLE savings trust account as defined in § 23.1-700.

        In any proceeding before the court for custody or visitation of a child, the court may order a custody or a psychological evaluation of any parent, guardian, legal custodian or person standing in loco parentis to the child, if the court finds such evaluation would assist it in its determination. The court may enter such orders as it deems appropriate for the payment of the costs of the evaluation by the parties.

Such order directing a party to provide a copy of such custody or visitation order shall further require such party, upon any subsequent change in the child's school enrollment, to provide a copy of such custody or visitation order to the new school at which the child is subsequently enrolled within three business days of such enrollment.

If the court finds that the respondent has failed to perform or comply with such order, and personal or substitute service has been obtained, the court may issue a civil show cause summons or a capias pursuant to this section. The court also may order the commitment of the person as provided in § 20-115 or the court may, in its discretion, impose a sentence of up to 12 months in jail, notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and 18.2-458, relating to punishment for contempt. If the court finds that an employer, who is under a payroll deduction order pursuant to § 20-79.1, has failed to comply with such order after being given a reasonable opportunity to show cause why he failed to comply with such order, then the court may proceed to impose sanctions on the employer pursuant to subdivision B 9 of § 20-79.3.

        Each juvenile and domestic relations district court may enter judgment for money in any amount for arrears of support and maintenance of any person in cases in which (i) the court has previously acquired personal jurisdiction over all necessary parties or a proceeding in which such jurisdiction has been obtained has been referred or transferred to the court by a circuit court or another juvenile and domestic relations district court and (ii) payment of such money has been previously ordered by the court, a circuit court, or another juvenile and domestic relations district court. Such judgment shall include reasonable attorneys' fees in cases where the total arrearage for support and maintenance, excluding interest, is equal to or greater than three months of support and maintenance. However, no judgment shall be entered unless the motion of a party, a probation officer, a local director of social services, or the court's own motion is duly served on the person against whom judgment is sought, in accordance with the applicable provisions of law relating to notice when proceedings are reopened.

     §
    
    16.1-278.19 precludes an award of fees when a party is represented by a nonprofit legal organization that does not charge for its services.

     Attorney fees award authorized.
    </b>
    - Trial court was authorized to award costs and attorney's fees to the mother in a case brought by a father seeking to terminate his parental obligations; additionally, the appellate court awarded the mother attorney's fees for an appeal of the dismissal of the father's petition. Cartwright v. Cartwright, 49 Va. App. 25, 635 S.E.2d 691, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 473</cite> (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in awarding a father attorney's fees in his child custody action because it denied the mother a de novo review on appeal and used the attorney's fees award as a punitive measure to punish the mother for pursuing her right to a trial de novo; the circuit court's action imposed upon the mother the burden of proving that the juvenile and domestic relations court judge had decided the parties' custody dispute wrongly and/or had weighed the evidence incorrectly, and the circuit court abdicated its responsibility to independently weigh the evidence, make its own credibility determinations, and decide in the exercise of its sound discretion in which parent custody would be vested so as to serve the best interest of the child. Alexander v. Flowers, 51 Va. App. 404, 658 S.E.2d 355, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 139</cite> (2008).

        Since a divorce matter did not arise from the juvenile and domestic relations district court,
    
     §

       </p>
       <p>
        In a child support modification case, an award of appellate attorney's fees to the mother was appropriate because the father only prevailed on one of essentially twenty-seven assignments of error. Barrett v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Soc. Servs., Div. of
    Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Barrett,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 245</cite> (July 26, 2011).

       <p>
        Pursuant to
    
     §
    
    16.1-278.19, a mother was entitled to an award of appellate attorney's fees because the father's appeal of an order finding him in contempt for failing to pay his child support obligation only added to the complexity, expense, and delay of the litigation, with no effect on the outcome. Barrett v. Commonwealth, No. 1381-10-3, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 246</cite> (July 26, 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child support dispute, a circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a father to pay $13,930.60 of the mother's attorney's fees and $15,000 of her expert fees because the father had a greater ability to pay than the mother, the case was long and intricate and required detailed testimony, and the father's less than desirable record keeping abilities caused the mother's expert to have to "reconstruct invoices and payments." James v. Owens, No. 1830-12-1, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 203</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 16, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother was properly awarded attorney fees because (1) the mother's pro bono representation did not bar an award, and (2) a father's ability to pay the award was considered. Barrett v. Minor, No. 1250-16-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 284</cite> (Oct. 23, 2018), appeal dismissed, mot. denied, sanctions allowed, 843 S.E.2d 749, 2020 Va. LEXIS 63 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate mandate directing an award of attorney fees was proper because (1) the award was statutorily authorized, and (2) a failure to raise the issue in a prior appeal barred relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. Barrett v. Minor, No. 1250-16-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 284</cite> (Oct. 23, 2018), appeal dismissed, mot. denied, sanctions allowed, 843 S.E.2d 749, 2020 Va. LEXIS 63 (2020).

     §
    
    16.1-278.19 that was filed by grandparents who were sued by a social services division after they were awarded custody of their grandchild. The court erred as a matter of law when the court denied the grandparents' request for attorney's fees because the statute required the court to evaluate the request based on the relative financial abilities of the parties, but the court based the decision on a non-statutory standard, namely, that the grandparents were not entitled to attorney's fees because the division's claims were not unreasonable. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, <cite class="va_code">276 Va. 465</cite>, 666 S.E.2d 361, 2008 Va. LEXIS 97 (2008).

    - On the husband's appeal from the parties' final decree of divorce, because the husband was not able to provide evidence of the amount of attorney fees he owed, and because he engaged in conduct that negatively impacted the trial proceedings, it was not unreasonable for the circuit court to deny his request for attorney fees.

        Legislature's use of the word "may" indicates that
    
     §
    
    16.1-278.19 is non-compulsory, as the trial court may award attorney's fees and costs, and similarly, the phrase "on behalf of any party" clearly indicates that fees and costs must first be incurred by the party before the trial court may make the award; thus,
    <span class="s1">
     §

    16.1-278.19 is clearly designed to give the trial court authority to shift the burden of attorney's fees and costs from one party to another and does not set out a requirement that a guardian ad litem's fees must be divided among the parties based on their relative financial abilities.

     Evidence of stalking to support protective order.
    </b>
    - Issuance of a protective order in a divorce action was upheld where the evidence showed that after the parties' separation the wife was stalked and harassed by the husband and was afraid for her personal safety to the extent that she saw a counselor, who diagnosed the wife as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. McBride v. McBride, No. 3258-03-4, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 640</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 28, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was evidence of a father's previous physical abuse against a mother, his pursuit of the mother and child in a car chase, his contact with the child and the mother at the child's sporting events despite the court order prohibiting him from attending, and his assault of a family friend in a parking lot at night in the mother and child's presence, the father's actions in stalking the mother and the child placed both in a reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury. Vechery v. Cottet-Moine, No. 0636-20-4, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 94</cite> (June 15, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to prove that in stalking a mother and a child, a father committed an act of abuse against a family member, and, therefore, the circuit court was authorized to issue an order to protect the mother and the child; the father intended to cause fear or knew or should have known that his conduct would cause fear for the mother and child because he pursued the mother and child in a car chase, and he knew the mother had reported that the child feared him. Vechery v. Cottet-Moine, No. 0636-20-4, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 94</cite> (June 15, 2021).

     Failure of proof.
    </b>
    - Where wife, who sought a permanent protective order after receiving from her former husband a CD on which two songs containing threatening lyrics had been burned, described no reasonable fear of immediate, serious bodily harm, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that she did not prove an actual threat or that her former husband's conduct was abuse within the meaning of
    
     §
    
    16.1-279.1. Martin v. Martin, No. 2740-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 350</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 18, 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a wife's petition for a protective order against her husband was not error under circumstances in which the parties presented different versions of the extent and content of the argument which led to the petition, and the trial court heard testimony from both parties and announced it found the wife's testimony less than credible; the trial court disbelieved the wife's version of the events and repeatedly admonished the wife during the hearing for interrupting the court with her outbursts and erratic behavior. Blake v. Blake,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 306</cite> (Aug. 14, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a mother's application for a protective order for her daughter, the trial court did not err in finding that child abuse was not proven as the father's witnesses amply corroborated the father's testimony that abuse did not occur, and the bruises on child were not so frequent nor were the injuries so grave that a pattern of abuse emerged as the only possible explanation. Jaouni v. Said Samir Ibrahim Salah, Nos. 0168-11-4, 0378-11-4, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 15</cite> (Jan. 24, 2012).

    - In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to show that the mother committed an act of family abuse because she admitted that she locked her son - who had had heat-induced seizures in the past - in the backseat of a car with only one window slightly open and left him there alone for an extended period of time while she continued shopping.

    </b>
    - In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the daughter had a reasonable apprehension of facing the same form of family abuse as her brother because a child could reasonably expect to face treatment from her parent similar to that received by her twin sibling.

    - Trial court did not err when it failed to include the parties' child in a protective order that was issued by that court. While plenty of testimony was provided concerning the hostility of the mother towards the father, aside from a denied allegation concerning a threat to burn down the father's house, the father made no other allegation that was in the record that demonstrated hostility on the part of the mother towards the child since she was born.

     Evidence of stalking to support protective order.
    </b>
    - Issuance of a protective order in a divorce action was upheld where the evidence showed that after the parties' separation the wife was stalked and harassed by the husband and was afraid for her personal safety to the extent that she saw a counselor, who diagnosed the wife as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. McBride v. McBride, No. 3258-03-4, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 640</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 28, 2004).

        <b>
     Failure of proof.
    </b>
    - Where wife, who sought a permanent protective order after receiving from her former husband a CD on which two songs containing threatening lyrics had been burned, described no reasonable fear of immediate, serious bodily harm, the evidence supported the trial court's finding that she did not prove an actual threat or that her former husband's conduct was abuse within the meaning of
    
     §
    
    16.1-279.1. Martin v. Martin, No. 2740-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 350</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 18, 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a wife's petition for a protective order against her husband was not error under circumstances in which the parties presented different versions of the extent and content of the argument which led to the petition, and the trial court heard testimony from both parties and announced it found the wife's testimony less than credible; the trial court disbelieved the wife's version of the events and repeatedly admonished the wife during the hearing for interrupting the court with her outbursts and erratic behavior.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a mother's application for a protective order for her daughter, the trial court did not err in finding that child abuse was not proven as the father's witnesses amply corroborated the father's testimony that abuse did not occur, and the bruises on child were not so frequent nor were the injuries so grave that a pattern of abuse emerged as the only possible explanation. Jaouni v. Said Samir Ibrahim Salah, Nos. 0168-11-4, 0378-11-4, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 15</cite> (Jan. 24, 2012).

     Sufficient evidence of family abuse.
    </b>
    - In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to show that the mother committed an act of family abuse because she admitted that she locked her son - who had had heat-induced seizures in the past - in the backseat of a car with only one window slightly open and left him there alone for an extended period of time while she continued shopping.

     Reasonable apprehension of family abuse.
    </b>
    - In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the evidence was sufficient to prove that the daughter had a reasonable apprehension of facing the same form of family abuse as her brother because a child could reasonably expect to face treatment from her parent similar to that received by her twin sibling. Walker v. Pierce, No. 0452-02-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 297</cite> (Dec. 8, 2020).

     Order authorized.
    </b>
    - Where the evidence showed that husband grabbed, pushed, and elbowed his former wife during a verbal argument relating to visitation schedule, evidence was sufficient to show that husband committed an act of abuse against a family member, and the trial court was authorized to issue a protective order. Lord v. Lord, No. 0049-02-4, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 362</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 25, 2002).

        Issuing a protective order was not error where the wife's testimony about the events, her injuries, and her fear of her husband were found more credible. Ward v. Baig-Ward, No. 0708-17-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 328</cite> (Dec. 19, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly granted a two-year family abuse protective order because the decision of the juvenile and domestic relations district court denying the protective order was a final order for purposes of appeal where the statutory protective order language was expansive rather than limiting. Jacobs v. Wilcoxson, 71 Va. App. 521, 838 S.E.2d 63, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 42</cite> (Feb. 18, 2020).

       <p>
        <b>
     Proceeding seeking the issuance of a protective order.
    </b>
    - Plea in bar was not proper in proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order because (1) a protective order was solely a creature of statute, (2) a plea in bar responded to a complaint, but a petition for a protective order was not a complaint, and (3) a protective order was not a cause of action. Baldwin v. Baldwin, No. 0310-19-4, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 290</cite> (Dec. 10, 2019).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Failure to serve order.
    </b>
    - Since a father had actual notice of the protective order preventing him from having contact with his children, the trial court properly held that it remained in effect, even though he was not served with a permanent protective order by the juvenile and domestic relations district court as required by this section. Grant v. Quigley, No. 0999-14-4, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 3</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 13, 2015).

        <b>
     Failure to include child in protective order.
    </b>
    - Trial court did not err when it failed to include the parties' child in a protective order that was issued by that court. While plenty of testimony was provided concerning the hostility of the mother towards the father, aside from a denied allegation concerning a threat to burn down the father's house, the father made no other allegation that was in the record that demonstrated hostility on the part of the mother towards the child since she was born.

         Implicit findings in protective order.
        </b>
        - Whether a finding that defendant represented a credible threat was explicit in the protective order's language or not, it was a necessary step in the state court's decision to issue the injunctive order under subdivision A 2 of
        §
        16.1-279.1, and the district court, in connection with defendant's conviction under 18 U.S.C.S.

      </h3>
      <p>
       When any juvenile court has found a juvenile to be in need of services or delinquent pursuant to the provisions of this law and reasonably believes such juvenile has mental illness or intellectual disability, the court may commit him to an appropriate hospital or order mandatory outpatient treatment in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 (§ 16.1-335 et seq.) or admit him to a training center in accordance with the provisions of § 37.2-806 for observation as to his mental condition. No juvenile shall be committed pursuant to this section or Article 16 (§ 16.1-335 et seq.) to a maximum security unit within any state hospital where adults determined to be criminally insane reside. However, the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services may place a juvenile who has been certified to the circuit court for trial as an adult pursuant to § 16.1-269.6 or 16.1-270 or who has been convicted as an adult of a felony in the circuit court in a unit appropriate for the care and treatment of persons under a criminal charge when, in his discretion, such placement is necessary to protect the security or safety of other patients, staff, or the public. The Commissioner shall notify the committing court of any placement in such unit. The committing court shall review the placement at 30-day intervals.

     Permanent foster care is distinct and secondary alternative to adoption.

    - A petition for permanent foster care is not a less drastic alternative to termination of parental rights.
    The court can only consider permanent foster care after it has determined that adoption, upon termination of residual parental rights, is not an alternative in a given case.
    Given this statutory preference, permanent foster care is a distinct and secondary alternative to adoption. Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep't of Social Servs., 10 Va. App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199 (1990), aff'd, Stanley v. Fairfax, <cite class="va_code">242 Va. 60</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991).

     Challenge to order amending foster care plan subsumed by affirmance of termination order.
    </b>
    - Circuit court's order terminating a mother's parental rights to her oldest son was upheld on appeal, based upon her concession that her residual parental rights to her youngest child were previously terminated, and her ability to parent her oldest son was impaired by her history of drug abuse, criminal and incarceration record, exposing son to a convicted child molester, and failure to respond to prior rehabilitation efforts; moreover, this decision to affirm the termination of parental rights necessarily subsumed the mother's appeal of the circuit court's companion order amending the Department of Social Service's foster care plan to authorize adoption because a preponderance of the evidence standard governed judicial modifications of foster care plans.

     §
    
    16.1-282, that changing the goal of a foster care service plan to "adoption" was in the best interests of a child as: (1) a father continued to use illegal drugs; (2) DSS had referred the father to a substance abuse treatment program on several occasions, and he never completed the treatment; (3) the father stated that he planned to use marijuana unless a court required him to stop; (4) the father failed to finish a parenting class, and failed to complete other recommended services despite being referred to the services by DSS; and (5) the father did not maintain regular visitation with the child, and failed to sustain contact with DSS or to involve himself in planning for the child.

     Preponderance of the evidence met.

    - Where the mother did not address the responsibilities identified by the department of social services to regain custody of her daughter, the department of social services proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the mother did not comply with the foster care plan; therefore, the trial court did not err in affirming an order changing the goal of the foster care plan to adoption.

       <p>
        Hampton Department of Social Services met its burden to show that it was in the best interests of the child to have her services plan have a goal of adoption where: (1) the child's father was periodically incarcerated while the child was in foster care and failed to address the responsibilities identified by DSS in order to regain custody of his child; (2) the child was thriving in foster care; (3) the father had no bond with the child; and (4) the father failed to regularly visit the child.

        In the case of a child who was the subject of a foster care plan filed with the court pursuant to § 16.1-281, a permanency planning hearing shall be held within 10 months of the dispositional hearing at which the foster care plan pursuant to § 16.1-281 was reviewed if the child (a) was placed through an agreement between the parents or guardians and the local board of social services where legal custody remains with the parents or guardians and such agreement has not been dissolved by court order; or (b) is under the legal custody of a local board of social services or a child welfare agency and has not had a petition to terminate parental rights filed on the child's behalf, has not been placed in permanent foster care, or is age 16 or over and the plan for the child is not independent living. The board or child welfare agency shall file a petition for a permanency planning hearing 30 days prior to the date of the permanency planning hearing scheduled by the court. The purpose of this hearing is to establish a permanent goal for the child and either to achieve the permanent goal or to defer such action through the approval of an interim plan for the child.

          The board or child welfare agency shall petition for alternative (vi) of subsection A only if the child has a severe and chronic emotional, physical or neurological disabling condition for which the child requires long-term residential treatment; and the board or child welfare agency has thoroughly investigated the feasibility of the alternatives listed in clauses (i) through (v) of subsection A and determined that none of those alternatives is in the best interests of the child. In a foster care plan filed with the petition pursuant to this section, the board or agency shall document the following: (i) the investigation conducted of the placement alternatives listed in clauses (i) through (v) of subsection A and why each of these is not currently in the best interest of the child; (ii) at least one compelling reason why none of the alternatives listed in clauses (i) through (v) is achievable for the child at the time placement in another planned permanent living arrangement is selected as the permanent goal for the child; (iii) the identity of the long-term residential treatment service provider; (iv) the nature of the child's disability; (v) the anticipated length of time required for the child's treatment; and (vi) the status of the child's eligibility for admission and long-term treatment. The court shall ensure that the local department has documentation of the intensive, ongoing, and, as of the date of the hearing, unsuccessful efforts made to return the child home or secure a placement for the child with a fit and willing relative, including adult siblings, or an adoptive parent, including through efforts that utilize search technology, including social media, to find the child's biological family members. The court shall ask the child about the child's desired permanency outcome and make a judicial determination, accompanied by an explanation of the reasons that the alternatives listed in clauses (i) through (iii) of subsection A continue to not be in the best interest of the child.

If the board or agency petitions for alternative (vi), alternative (vi) may be approved by the court for a period of six months at a time.

The board or child welfare agency shall file such petitions for review pursuant to the provisions of § 16.1-282 and shall, in addition, include in the petition the information required by subdivision A2 1. The petition for foster care review shall be filed no later than 30 days prior to the hearing scheduled in accordance with subdivision A2 3. At the conclusion of the foster care review hearing, if alternative (vi) of subsection A remains the permanent plan, the court shall enter an order that states whether reasonable efforts have been made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to monitor the child's status in another planned permanent living arrangement.

     Challenge to order amending foster care plan subsumed by affirmance of termination order.
    </b>
    - Circuit court's order terminating a mother's parental rights to her oldest son was upheld on appeal, based upon her concession that her residual parental rights to her youngest child were previously terminated, and her ability to parent her oldest son was impaired by her history of drug abuse, criminal and incarceration record, exposure of that son to a convicted child molester, and failure to respond to prior rehabilitation efforts; moreover, this decision to affirm the termination of parental rights necessarily subsumed the mother's appeal of the circuit court's companion order amending the Department of Social Service's foster care plan to authorize adoption because a preponderance of the evidence standard governed judicial modifications of foster care plans.

        The residual parental rights of a parent or parents may be terminated by the court as hereinafter provided in a separate proceeding if the petition specifically requests such relief. No petition seeking termination of residual parental rights shall be accepted by the court prior to the filing of a foster care plan, pursuant to § 16.1-281, which documents termination of residual parental rights as being in the best interests of the child. The court may hear and adjudicate a petition for termination of parental rights in the same proceeding in which the court has approved a foster care plan which documents that termination is in the best interests of the child. The court may terminate the residual parental rights of one parent without affecting the rights of the other parent. The local board of social services or a licensed child-placing agency need not have identified an available and eligible family to adopt a child for whom termination of parental rights is being sought prior to the entry of an order terminating parental rights.

     Constitutionality.

    - This section does not violate the provisions of the Va. Const., Art. I,
    
     §§
    
    1 and 11. Knox v. Lynchburg Div. of Social Servs., <cite class="va_code">223 Va. 213</cite>, 288 S.E.2d 399 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section is not void for vagueness, since the statute contains clear and specific guidelines for its application in particular cases. Helen W. v. Fairfax County Dep't of Human Dev., 12 Va. App. 877, 407 S.E.2d 25 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing in the Constitution guarantees continuation of the parent-child relationship once fundamentally fair procedures have been followed to prove parental unfitness. Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Social Servs., 16 Va. App. 821, 433 S.E.2d 500 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1050, 115 S. Ct. 651, 130 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1994).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Due process requirement.
         </b>
         - Due process requires the trial courts to comply strictly with the statutory scheme for disposition of child custody cases. Rader v. Montgomery County Dep't of Social Servs., 5 Va. App. 523, 365 S.E.2d 234 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Before a state may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of a parent in his or her natural child, due process requires that the state support its allegations of parental unfitness by at least clear and convincing evidence. Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Social Servs., 16 Va. App. 821, 433 S.E.2d 500 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1050, 115 S. Ct. 651, 130 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1994).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Due process rights held not violated.
         </b>
         - Where no evidence was presented that less drastic measures were available to the trial court, and the statutory requirements for termination of parental rights were met, the trial court's order terminating the parents' residual parental rights did not violate the parents' fourteenth amendment due process rights. Helen W. v. Fairfax County Dep't of Human Dev., 12 Va. App. 877, 407 S.E.2d 25 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's due process rights were not violated by terminating her parental rights to her son where the Department of Social Services (DSS) provided her with one-on-one assistance from a therapeutic foster mother, mental retardation services, psychiatric treatment, employment counseling, and mentoring services; and there were no other services that DSS could provide. Given the son's cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, developmental delays, astigmatism, hearing problem, eczema, a tear duct deformity requiring several therapies and medications, and the mother's cognitive limitations, it was unlikely she would ever be able to parent the son. Porter v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 58</cite> (Feb. 5, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father had adequate notice of a termination proceeding because credible evidence supported the trial court's finding that a county department of social services made adequate efforts to give the father notice of the proceedings in the case; the department issued an order of publication in a local newspaper, and the father's due process rights were not violated when the order of publication was published in English because he would have been put on notice to seek a translation of the document. Perez-Velasquez v. Culpeper County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0360-09-4, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 293</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 30, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Court properly denied a mother's motion to dismiss a petition to terminate her parental rights based on alleged noncompliance with the notice requirements of subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, as the petitions, summonses, and notices provided her with notice sufficient to satisfy the threshold constitutional standard of fundamentally fair procedures, and she never expressed any doubt as to the nature of the proceedings. Burch v. Alexandria Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Mar. 13, 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the termination hearing began almost two years after the child entered foster care, the 12-month time period in this section was not arbitrary or capricious and resulted in a deprivation of due process. Hough v. Mathews Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 306</cite> (Sept. 9, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a parental rights termination case, a father's due process rights were not violated because the trial court ruled consistent with any applicable due process requirements. Rucker v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., No. 0931-17-4, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 110</cite> (Apr. 24, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         When the father appeared before the circuit court, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court's ruling had been annulled, and, at that point, the father had approximately eight months' notice of the intention of the Department of Social Services to change the goal to adoption and termination of his parental rights; thus, the father had sufficient notice of the change, and his due process rights were not violated. Sabir v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1866-18-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 126</cite> (May 28, 2019).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Actual notice received.
    </b>
    - In a parental rights termination case, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying a mother's motion for a continuance because the evidence supported the circuit court's factual findings that the mother had actual notice of the termination hearing but did not appear. Santos v. Bedford Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0727-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 292</cite> (Oct. 30, 2018).

         <b>
     Construction of termination statutes.
    </b>

    - Circuit court erred in denying a petition filed against a mother and a father terminating their parental rights by holding that both parents were victims of their poverty, as such was an incorrect standard to its review of the evidence; both the statutes and the case law governing termination of parental rights did not support the conclusion that severe poverty, per se, mitigated against termination.

          Separate proceeding needed.

Cogan v. Fairfax County Dep't of Human Dev., No. 0019-93-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 22, 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "separate proceeding," as used in this section, means a hearing separate and distinct from an abuse and neglect adjudication, entrustment disposition, or foster care placement; the term does not mean that a totally separate case must be initiated in the juvenile court.
    Rather, the statute requires that initially, a petition must be filed specifically requesting termination of parental rights so that proper notice is given. Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep't of Social Servs., 10 Va. App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="va_code">242 Va. 60</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in hearing petitions for termination and custody simultaneously in a case where the mother was mentally retarded and the trial court was searching for a placement of her child because the mother was unable to care for the child; the term "separate proceeding" meant that the termination hearing had to be separate and distinct from an abuse and neglect adjudication, entrustment disposition, or foster care placement and review, and not necessarily a custody hearing. Rouse v. Russell County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0944-04-3, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 15, 2005).

        <p>
         Because the term, "separate proceeding" in
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 only required the trial court to hold a separate hearing to ensure that the termination issue was not confused with other issues to be resolved under the statutory scheme, and the trial court did hold separate hearings for the abused and neglected determination and the termination decision, the court did not err by dismissing the petitions for termination as premature.

     Permanent foster care not less drastic alternative to parental rights termination.
    </b>
    - A petition for permanent foster care is not a less drastic alternative to termination of parental rights.
    The court can only consider permanent foster care after it has determined that adoption, upon termination of residual parental rights, is not an alternative in a given case.
    Given this statutory preference, permanent foster care is a distinct, and secondary, alternative to adoption. Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep't of Social Servs., 10 Va. App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="va_code">242 Va. 60</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991).

    - In providing a foster care plan filing requirement in this section, the legislature contemplated that the most recent plan of record would recommend termination of parental rights.
    Thus this section implicitly requires that the petition seeking termination of parental rights be directly preceded or accompanied by a foster care plan documenting that termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child.

         Where the Department of Social Services did not file a foster care plan that recommended termination of both parents' parental rights to their five children, the circuit judge was not authorized to terminate the parents' parental rights; moreover, if the Department wished to pursue termination of the parental rights, it had a duty to first file a foster care plan in the district court with the goal of terminating parental rights, and absent such, it failed to follow its obligations under both

         Court of appeals found that it could not provide relief to a father who appealed a circuit court's decision affirming a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court's order approving a foster care plan for his child because the father had not appealed a separate order issued by the JDR district court that terminated his residual parental rights. As such, nothing the court could do in the father's appeal - even if it reversed the foster care plan recommendations - would change the fact that the father had no parental rights left to protect.

        </p>
        <p>
         Statutory framework of the statute was followed because the juvenile and domestic relations district (JDR) court held a separate hearing related to the petitions for termination and entered orders terminating a mother's parental rights to the children on that date; the mother filed notices of appeal for the JDR court orders terminating her parental rights, and the prior appeals of the permanency planning orders did not affect the jurisdiction of the JDR court to consider termination petitions.

        <p>
         Statute does not require the approval of a foster care plan with the goal of adoption before a court can consider a petition to terminate residual parental rights; rather, the statute requires the filing of the requisite foster care plan before a court can consider a petition to terminate residual parental rights.

         Before termination of parental rights by the court, the agency seeking termination has an affirmative duty to investigate all reasonable options for placement with immediate relatives, but the agency does not have a duty to investigate the home of every relative of the children, however remote, as a potential placement.

         A county department of social services (DSS) is mandated to produce sufficient evidence so that the court may properly determine whether there are relatives willing and suitable to take custody of the child, and to consider such relatives in comparison to other placement options; thus, where DSS investigated a father's mother as a possible placement for the father's child at the time of the child's removal and presented the facts to the trial court for its consideration, DSS complied with the mandate of

         Trial court exercised reasonable diligence in investigating five family members with whom the court sought to place a child prior to terminating the parent's residual parental rights as required by subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. There was no evidence any of the relatives the parent proffered for placement were suitable or willing to care for the child, particularly in light of the child's developmental delays.

         Where the Department of Social Services investigated the maternal grandmother, as identified by the mother, as a possible relative placement for the child, but found that the grandmother was not a suitable custodian based on the grandmother's health issues and other obligations, the Department made reasonable efforts and was not required to go in search of other possible relative placements not proffered by the mother.

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in rejecting the mother's sister as a suitable candidate for relative placement without further investigation by the Department of Social Services because the sister's testimony at the ore tenus hearing provided the trial court with sufficient evidence to determine whether the sister was a relative willing and suitable to take custody of the children.

         Trial court did not err in concluding that the Department of Social Services satisfactorily investigated possible relative placements pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because the department presented sufficient evidence to the trial court regarding the relatives offered by the parents as possible placements; the department was not required to undergo a vain and useless undertaking by investigating a Georgia aunt who was elderly and did not want custody of the children, and another aunt did not have suitable housing for the children.

         Contrary to mother's arguments, the social services department investigated several of the mother's relatives for placement, but her sister did not pick up the child from the hospital, the mother's brother had custody for three weeks, then returned the child, the grandmother was unable to care for the child, and although an aunt expressed interest in custody, she did not pursue it.

        <p>
         It was the responsibility of the department of social services to investigate all reasonable potential relative placements, but there was no evidence that the father's aunt was suitable or willing to care for the child, plus the father did not suggest the aunt and the department was not required to investigate the home of every relative; the department sent letters to relatives but received no responses, evaluating and investigating alternative placement is a very important part of the process when considering whether to terminate parental rights, and the trial court did not err in finding that the requirements were met in this case.

         Circuit court was not plainly wrong in finding that a county department of social services made reasonable efforts to investigate a mother's relatives and to place the children with relatives because department of social services was not required to consider a family member as a placement option after that individual was incarcerated or to make further efforts to investigate non-immediate family members; the great-aunt and great-uncle were not immediate relatives and never became engaged in the placement process.

         Department of Social Services satisfied its duty to consider placement of the child with a relative prior to terminating the father's parental rights, finding that the grandmother had not attempted to forge a relationship with the child, while the child was in a stable and secure environment with foster parents, with whom she had a healthy relationship and her siblings, with whom she had a close bond.

         Record supported the finding that the department sufficiently investigated possible relative placements where the maternal grandmother had not completed the paperwork and expressed doubt as to her husband's willingness to go through the process, and the department had not received positive responses from any possible relatives.

         Trial court did not err in finding that the Department of Social Services had no duty to investigate a person as a possible relative placement because there was no evidence to suggest that the person named in the note was a person with a legitimate interest, as the father could not recall her name or where she lived, and he had not asked her to come to any of the court hearings.

     Termination of incarcerated parent's rights.
    </b>
    - Trial court properly terminated incarcerated father's residual parental rights under subdivision C 2 of this section, as evidence was clear and convincing that beyond the biological fact of parentage, no relational history existed between the father and child, that father was not aware that he was child's father until the Department of Social Services contacted him, and that he never developed any type of relationship with the child; child's need for stability and proof that direct contact with father would be detrimental provided additional support that termination was in the child's best interest.

That the grandmother did not present herself to the Department of Social Services or the trial court as an alternative placement for the children to the termination of parental rights was not material. The Department had the duty to investigate her for that purpose; she did not have a duty to present herself as an alternative. Sauer v. Franklin County Dep't of Social Servs., 18 Va.

    - Circuit court was not required to make an express finding as to the completion or adequacy of the department's investigation of maternal grandparents as an alternative placement option; the circuit court is only required to consider granting custody to persons with a legitimate interest, and the record showed that the circuit court considered placement with the grandparents, found that they had not done what was required to meet the child's needs, and dismissed their petitions for custody and visitation, which ruling was not plainly wrong.

         Social services agency satisfied its duty to investigate and present evidence of the suitability of children's relatives as suitable custodians for the children prior to an order terminating parental rights; the agency was not required to investigate the home of every relative, especially those whom the parents failed to suggest to the agency.

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court gave adequate consideration to the aunt as a potential custodian before determining that it would not be proper to place the two children with the aunt because the aunt was only 18-years-old, did not have a long employment history, and lived with a boyfriend at a location where she had resided less than six months; accordingly, the mother's parental rights in her two children were properly terminated.

         Because there was no relative with whom a father's child could be placed, the trial court properly found that it was in the child's best interests to change the goal of a permanency planning order from return to parent to adoption.

         Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to consider the child's relative as alternatives to foster care where, the maternal grandmother was 79 years old, resided half the year in assisted living that did not allow children, had suffered a series of minor strokes, was a cancer survivor, and was unable to identify anyone to help the grandmother if the grandmother was unable to care for the child.

         Because the circuit court considered granting custody of a mother's children to relatives and because there was sufficient evidence to support its decision to approve the goal of adoption, the circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's residual parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of

         Trial court did not err in failing to investigate relative placement with the father's brother as required by
    
     §

     §
    
    16.1-283; therefore, they did not qualify as "immediate relatives" entitled to consideration for custody of the child after the mother's parental rights were terminated. Bagley v.

        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court did not err in placing the child with the mother's cousin because placement with the paternal grandmother was not in the child's best interests as she would allow the father, who had been convicted of the rape and aggravated sexual battery of one of his biological children, to live with her and to contact his children if he were released from prison, and another living adjustment would be damaging in itself and not in the child's best interest considering that the child was happy where she was and doing well; and the mother's cousin testified that the child was doing very well at his home, and that he was willing and qualified to care for and provide a suitable home for the child.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because there were no suitable relative placements as it was not in the child's best interests to be sent to another state to live with an uncle whom the child did not know well when the child had a local support system that was actively addressing the child's special needs.

         Termination of a father's parental rights instead of placement of the child with the paternal grandfather was appropriate because the court found that it was not in the child's best interest to grant custody to the grandfather as the child had significant physical and mental issues which required therapy and it would have been difficult for the elderly grandfather to have raised the child. The child needed a permanent home, which the grandfather was unable to provide in the long term, while the foster parents wanted to adopt the child. Sonberg v.

         Trial court did not err in entering a judgment that terminated the father's parental rights in the two children he had with the wife; even though it was true that the county social services department did not offer him rehabilitative services, the termination of his parental rights were due to his abuse of other children residing with the father and his incarceration, and, thus, the county social services department was not required to provide reasonable and necessary social services, as it was not reasonably likely that the conditions which led to the abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the safe return of the children to the father within a reasonable period of time.

         Father's incarceration, standing alone, was insufficient to support the termination of his parental rights, but it was a valid and proper circumstance which, when combined with other evidence about the parent/child relationship, supported the termination of the father's rights; the father had no bond with his three year old child, and had seen her once, while he was in prison.

         Because a mother's incarceration was the only factor supporting termination of her parental rights and the only reason that the mother was unable to timely remedy the conditions that led to her child's placement in foster care, the trial court erred in finding that termination of the mother's parental rights was in her child's best interest; the mother had shown a willingness and ability to take advantage of all the parenting and skill development classes offered to her during her incarceration, had continual contact with her child during her incarceration by having visits with him once or twice a month and by sending him notes, cards, and worksheets, and upon her release, planned to pay off her debts, provide stable housing, and provide stable care for her child.

    - Because a mother had just been through a prior involuntary termination proceeding, the circuit court had no authority to order additional services be provided to her; hence, the circuit court did not err in approving the adoption foster care plan for the mother's oldest son without first insisting that the Department of Social Services provide remedial services in aid of reunification.

         Father's parental rights were properly terminated under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as subsections B and C provided individual bases upon which a county department of social services could seek to terminate residual parental rights, and rehabilitative services were not prerequisite to termination under subsection B; the father's destructive pattern of alcohol abuse and domestic violence, and his inability to meet the basic needs of his children, provided clear and convincing evidence that the neglect or abuse suffered by the children presented a serious and substantial threat to their lives, health, or development, and made it not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in such neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the children's safe return to the father within a reasonable period of time.

     Failure to remedy conditions.
    </b>
    - Under
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 C 2, an agency made reasonable efforts to help a mother remedy the conditions causing the placement of her children and she, without good cause, did not substantially remedy those conditions, where the agency helped her obtain parenting instruction and a psychological evaluation, as well as in-home therapy assistance, but she did not show, when a trial return of the children home was attempted, an ability to control their deteriorating behavior or supervise them and she placed her eldest child in a caretaking role as to the other three, and showed an inability to control her anger. Van Buren v. City of Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 2622-02-2, 2623-02-2, 2624-02-2, 2625-02-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 222</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 15, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating parental rights where the parent's violent behavior both inside and outside the home, and the parent's refusal to take required medication, thereby exacerbating anger management problems, established by clear and convincing evidence that the parent's willful failure to remedy the conditions led to and required the continued foster care placement of the children.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that 3 1/2 years after their placement in foster care, the mother was still unable to provide for the children, and the mother failed to progress to the point where she could protect her children from harm. K.H. v. Newport News Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1800-03-1, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 51</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 3, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that 18 months after their placement in foster care the mother was still unable to provide for the children, the mother failed to maintain a safe and stable living environment, she inconsistently participated in visitation, she did not demonstrate an ability to put her children's physical and emotional needs ahead of her own, and she failed to maintain contact with the Department; thus, demonstrating that the mother failed to make significant progress on most of her goals and responsibilities under the foster care service plan.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's rights was in the children's best interests and there was no error in failing to continue the case. The mother did not follow the treatment recommendations as required under the foster care plans, she continued to live with her boyfriend, a convicted sex offender, even though she was warned that doing so would place the children at risk, and she failed to: maintain adequate housing, follow through on counseling, and obtain adequate and regular employment.

        <p>
         Where a mother failed to take advantage of extensive opportunities and housing, utilities, medical supplies, social services, substance abuse counseling, parenting classes, clothing and other household items, and the acceptance of money, clothes, baby supplies, and payment of utilities failed to get her to the point where she could parent her child, clear and convincing evidence was presented to establish that she was unable or unwilling to remedy the conditions which caused placement of the child with the Division of Social Services; thus, the appeals court summarily affirmed the the trial court's decision.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's residual parental rights was upheld where the court found that she failed to meaningfully avail herself of the offered services and failed to remedy the conditions that resulted in foster care placement; the evidence showed that the mother failed to maintain any one job for more than a few weeks, failed to make and keep appointments, failed to follow treatment plans, failed to acknowledge that she displayed erratic behavior during visitation, failed to acknowledge that she was involved in an abusive relationship for which she would not seek assistance, and failed to improve any areas identified by the Department of Social Services.

        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were terminated where he failed to meaningfully improve the conditions that resulted in foster care placement; the father attended parenting classes and received intensive services from Family Preservation Services, but failed to implement the skills and proved to be unable to apply what they taught him, he failed to follow through with counseling, he discontinued marital counseling, he floated from job to job, he failed to pay utility bills despite having adequate income, and he failed to respond to recommendations for rectifying his circumstances.

        </p>
        <p>
         The mother failed to complete a nutrition and safety program, failed to attend a second mental health appointment, and failed to appear for a scheduled psychiatric evaluation; in addition, the mother was required to obtain stable housing independent of her mother, but she leased an apartment only three days prior to the termination hearing and there was no furniture in the apartment, and the mother was required to obtain stable employment, but the evidence proved she worked at one job for approximately one month prior to the termination hearing and had another job for a short period of time.

        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated the father's parental rights, as the city social services department showed by the required clear and convincing evidence that the father failed to remedy the conditions that caused his two minor children to be placed into foster care and the two minor children were not required to wait indefinitely for him to remedy those conditions, especially since his failure to do so resulted from his frequent incarceration. Butler v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 234</cite> (June 14, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Record supported a trial court's finding that the best interests of a father's children would be served by terminating the father's parental rights, because the evidence was clear and convincing that the father had failed to substantially remedy his unstable and unsafe home environment by maintaining a job and a safe home for six months, as required by the social services department, and although he had participated in parenting classes required by the department, he completed neither of the programs that he attended. Blair v. Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 187</cite> (May 10, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of a mother's parental rights to her children, because although she was offered assistance and services, she failed to make any progress in addressing the sexual abuse of her children by their father. Rather, the mother threatened to kidnap the children from their caregivers and threatened to harm those caring for her children. Williams v. Buckingham Dep't of Soc.

         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights, giving due weight to the efforts she made to remedy the concerns that led to the foster care placement of her minor children, and notwithstanding the reasonable efforts made by the Department of Social Services, as the record evidence showed that the mother failed to remedy the problems that led to foster care placement in the first place, she lacked stable housing, and had a history of domestic violence and alcohol addiction. Viar v. Chesterfield-Colonial Heights Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 59</cite> (Feb. 14, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of the mother's parental rights; the neglect and abuse suffered by the child presented a substantial threat to the child's life, health, and development, and the mother failed to substantially remedy the conditions that resulted in removal within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed 12 months, despite the services offered by the Harrisonburg Rockingham Social Services District. Harris v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 363</cite> (Aug. 8, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was upheld based on the court's finding that, at time of the termination hearing, the father had failed to remedy the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement; the father had not maintained stable housing or employment, had not received the recommended psychiatric treatment, had not completed parenting classes, and had not maintained regularly scheduled visits with the child.

         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, as the evidence established that she failed to sufficiently improve the living conditions in her home that led to the removal of her special needs child, and that she failed to maintain contact with the child, whose condition had significantly improved while in foster care and whose foster mother wanted to adopt her. Fauncher-Whitney v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 449</cite> (Oct. 10, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was affirmed where the mother cooperated with the county department of social services and took advantage of the services offered, but the mother's mental capacity rendered her unable to remedy the conditions that led to the children's placement in foster care; one child was not bonded to the mother and resisted visitation with her, but had dramatically improved while in foster care, and both children had evolved from "wild animals" to wonderful, well behaved children. Ratcliff v. Dickenson County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 432</cite> (Sept. 26, 2006).

         Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her son pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, because a county department of social services presented clear and convincing evidence that the mother failed to seek substance abuse treatment or mental health counseling, and failed to provide for the child's needs. Buchanan v. Bedford County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 30</cite> (Jan. 30, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that the mother was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the child's removal; despite 18 months of intensive services, the mother's home was still not safe for the children, having stacked dishes in the sink, open box cutters in multiple rooms, mattresses without sheets, laundry strewn about the house, and food in the bedrooms. Bailey v. City of Alexandria Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 244</cite> (June 19, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         As reasonable and appropriate efforts were expended by the Department of Social Services (DSS) to assist a mother in remedying the conditions that led to the removal of her minor child from her custody, and the mother consistently frustrated those efforts, by: (1) providing false information; (2) missing scheduled appointments; (3) not communicating with the DSS; (4) missing most visitations with the minor child; and (5) attending visits with that child immediately after she had abused drugs, the trial court did not err in terminating her residual parental rights to said child.

        <p>
         Where a mother asserted that cultural reasons and her 25-year-old illegal immigration status were good cause for her failure to remedy a situation that led to her son's foster care placement, a fact finder was entitled to reject those reasons and conclude that the mother failed to show good cause for the delay in remedying the situation and that termination of her residual parental rights was in her son's best interests under
    
     §

        <p>
         Record supported a trial court's finding that the evidence proved by clear and convincing evidence that the father's parental rights to his children had to be terminated pursuant to subsection B and subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 and that the termination of his parental rights was in the children's best interests because despite all of the services and interventions that were provided, the father was unable to maintain a clean house and safe environment for the children; the father failed to follow through on many of the requirements of the department of social services, including counseling, medication management, and obtaining his GED [now the High school equivalency examination], and one of the children had profound developmental delays when he was removed from the father's care, but after time with his foster family, he improved dramatically.

        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights because the evidence proved that the mother had significant substance abuse problems that presented a serious threat to the child; despite the fact that the child was in foster care for approximately three years, the mother was unable to substantially remedy the problems that led to the child being placed, and remaining, in foster care.

     Grounds for termination under subsection B.
    </b>
    - Under subsection B, the residual rights of a parent of a child placed in foster care because of parental neglect or abuse may be terminated only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that (1) termination is in the best interests of the child; (2) the neglect or abuse suffered by the child presented a serious and substantial threat to the child's life, health or development and (3) it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in the neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated to allow the child's safe return to his parent within a reasonable period of time.

        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's residual parental rights to her son were properly terminated where evidence of her psychological problems and her exposing the child to an abusive boyfriend clearly and convincingly established that the abuse or neglect suffered by her son presented a serious threat to his life, health, or development; that she failed to remedy the conditions that led to his placement in foster care; and that termination was in his best interest. Arthur v. Campbell County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 50</cite> (Feb. 7, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Social services department proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights was in a minor child's best interests and that it was not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in the child's neglect or abuse were to be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child's safe return to the parent within a reasonable period of time pursuant to subdivision B 2. The department's evidence was sufficient to clearly and convincingly prove that the parent was suffering from a mental or emotional illness or mental deficiency of such severity that there was no reasonable expectation that the parent would be able to undertake responsibility for the care needed by the child in accordance with the child's age and stage of development. Robeson v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 553</cite> (Dec. 23, 2008).

        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the mother allowed an older child, who had previous sexual contact with a younger child, to have contact with the younger children and did not recognize there to be a problem. Mayanes v. Shenandoah Valley Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 37</cite> (Feb. 8, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supported termination of parental rights as it showed that the father failed to complete most of the requirements established by the agency to return his child home, he could not feed the child properly and frequently became frustrated, the father was diagnosed with mental health issues and was involuntarily hospitalized for these issues, and he never completed counseling sessions. Masch v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0222-13-3, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 208</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 23, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because the father's mental illness prevented him from being able to take care of his child as he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; he had very little insight regarding keeping the child safe; the child had several delays and needed ongoing therapy; and there was no evidence that the father was able to meet the child's mental health needs. Perry v. Prince George Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2350-14-2, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 194</cite> (June 9, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights, as the evidence showed that the children had tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana and suffered various side effects from such exposure, the father had abused alcohol and illegal drugs, received disability for a back injury, was not employed, had a history of domestic violence, and had complaints of abuse and neglect regarding his other children, and the father did not take advantage of the services offered to him.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights and approval of foster care goal of adoption was appropriate because the father sexually abused one of the children and neglected all of the children, the father had anger management issues and reluctantly participated in rehabilitation services, and the children required extensive counseling. Further, the 17-year-old child expressed a desire to be in permanent foster care in the same foster home, while the younger children were doing very well in foster care and had bonded with their foster mother.

     §
    
    16.1-283, and the mother appealed, the Petersburg Department of Social Services presented clear and convincing evidence that her neglect of her four children presented a serious and substantial threat to their life, health or development, and it was not reasonably likely that the conditions could be substantially corrected within a reasonable period of time. After the father was convicted of felony child abuse of one of her children and accused of molesting two of her children, the mother continued to maintain a relationship with him. Strother v.

         </b>
         - Termination was in the best interest of a child due to a mother's inability to remedy the conditions that led to the removal and the child's wish to be adopted by the "right family." The trial court considered the child's age, the length of time she resided in an agency's placement, and the mother's failure to remedy the conditions that caused the child to be placed in foster care in 2005.

        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests as it was not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated because she had a history of mental illness; in February and July 2017, she was hospitalized for attempting suicide and, in January 2019, for having suicidal thoughts; she did not regularly attend counseling; she did not visit with the children for months; she did not show that she had developed coping skills and was capable of parenting the children safely; and the parents had habitually abused intoxicating drugs and liquors, to the point where it made it difficult or impossible to care for the children.

         - Language of this statute is not limited to the petitioning agency or even to agencies within Virginia; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support a termination of a mother's parental rights because it was proper to consider the nature and breadth of services that had been provided to the mother in Tennessee when the child was originally removed from her care in 2005. The trial court also considered the fact that a Tennessee agency assumed custody of the child because there was clear and convincing evidence of on-going and substantial harm if the child was returned to the mother's custody, and the mother could not remedy the conditions that led to removal in a reasonable amount of time.

    - Evidence was sufficient to terminate a mother's parental rights on the basis that the children were abused or neglected because the mother's continued drug use created an unsafe environment, and the mother's failure to adequately address one child's medical needs created an unsafe environment for all the children because a doctor expressed concerns regarding the child's weight and malnourishment.

         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because she had sexually abused her oldest child, violated a safety plan by assuming care of the children when she knew she was only allowed supervised visitation, left the children unsupervised and alone when they were locked out of the house, did not participate or take advantage of the services offered, and it was not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in such neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated.

         Clear and convincing evidence supported terminating a father's residual parental rights to three children on grounds the children were abused or neglected because the children were affected by the father's substance abuse and incarceration, and the father beat the children, failed to complete any of the required conditions in the service plan, did not maintain contact with the Department of Social Services, and failed to appear at all court proceedings after June 2011.

         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's residual parental rights because she did not protect her seven-year-old child against the long-standing sexual abuse by the mother's boyfriend, the mother placed her own needs above those of the child, and, despite counseling, was unwilling and unable to substantially remedy the conditions that resulted in the child's neglect or abuse.

         Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of residual parental rights because, despite a panoply of services provided to the father over the years, he continued to abuse or neglect his children, lapse into substance abuse, or engage in violence or other criminal activities.

         Trial court did not err in terminating parental rights because a county department of social services considered more than the parent's imprisonment when it decided to file petitions to terminate the parental rights, as it also considered the children's situation prior to their removal. Moreover, while the trial court considered the parent's reduction in prison time, it was concerned that the children would be placed back in the environment from which they were removed. Moore v.

         Mother's parental rights were terminated because she did not substantially remedy the situation that would have returned the children to her care, the children had been in foster care for 23 months, and termination was in the best interest of the children.

         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper and in the child's best interests because the child only weighed 33 pounds at 15; the mother did not address the issues concerning his health and nutritional needs; a doctor testified that when the child was admitted to the hospital the child's condition was critical in that his severity of hypothyroidism was life-threatening; the doctor opined that the child's total long-term height would be lower than if he had been offered adequate nutrition throughout his life and his severe hypothyroidism long-term would affect what his ultimate cognitive potential was; and, while in foster care, the child gained weight, grew taller, and started attending school and interacting with others.

         Record supported the circuit court's decision to terminate the parents' parental rights, as there was an abundance of evidence that the children suffered neglect; poor conditions were repeatedly pointed out to the parents but they failed to remedy them, the children often had serious medical issues, yet the parents failed to follow through with necessary treatment, and the parents were unable to effectively improve their parenting skills, despite any education and training that could be provided.

         Evidence was sufficient to find that it was not reasonably likely that the mother could substantially correct or eliminate the conditions so as to allow the children to return given that her severe intellectual disabilities significantly impaired her cognitive and emotional functioning, as well as her life skills, and while she now lived in her own home, she was unable to provide consistent basic necessities.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights because the family had a history of domestic violence, the Department of Social Services had previously removed the children and provided services to the parents, but after the children were returned to the father's custody they had to be removed again after he was arrested for a road rage incident. The children were at risk in the father's care as evidenced by his convictions for assault and battery, reckless driving, and hit and run, one child revealed that the father had hit him with his hand and a belt, and the father chose not to participate in anger management classes, psychological testing, or counseling.

         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper, as the conditions that resulted in the abuse or neglect could not have been substantially corrected to allow the children to return home, and in the children's best interests because the mother had a major drug problem and no treatment was ever followed through on; she did not participate in other required services, other than a six-week parenting class that took her six months to complete; she did not apply what she had learned in the parenting class; the children had been in foster care for almost 22 months; and the mother had not completed the Department of Social Services' requirements and was not in a position to care for the children.

        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper and in the child's best interest because the Department of Social Services presented extensive evidence regarding the family's history of domestic violence and the mother's mental illness; the child had a history of emotional and behavioral concerns that the parents could not handle; the Department previously had provided numerous services to the parents; the child had spent almost half of her life in foster care; and a doctor feared that the mother could not keep the child safe and opined that the mother should not be the primary custodian of the child.

         Circuit court did not err in finding that it was in the child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights because no effort on the mother's part would correct her mental deficits within a reasonable period of time,and the child would be in significant danger if left in her custody; a doctor recommended that the mother not be the child's primary caregiver because she did not have the ability to be a full-time parent and custodian and keep herself and her child safe.

         Termination of a father's parental rights and approval of foster care goal of adoption for father's child were appropriate because the circuit court found by clear and convincing evidence that termination due to abuse and neglect was in the best interests of the child as the father had a history of domestic violence and substance abuse, the father did not show that the father could remain sober and was capable of caring for the child, and the child had been in foster care for approximately two years.

     Consideration of rehabilitation services.
    </b>
    - Subsection B required only that a circuit court consider whether rehabilitation services, if any, had been provided to a parent, but nothing in this section or the larger statutory scheme required that such services be provided in all cases as a prerequisite to termination; because the evidence supported the trial court's decision that reunification was inconsistent with children's health and safety, the department's failure to provide rehabilitation services in aid of reunification was not a viable ground for reversal of a termination order. Toms v. Hanover Dep't of Soc. Servs., 46 Va. App. 257, 616 S.E.2d 765, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 308</cite> (2005).

         Trial court properly terminated a mother's residual parental rights to her newborn child pursuant to subdivision B 2 a of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because there was no requirement that a department of social services provide rehabilitative services to the mother; termination pursuant to subsection B only required that the trial court consider whether any rehabilitative services were provided to the mother.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subsection B, was supported by evidence that the mother failed to take advantage of the services that the county provided to address the mother's parenting skills and substance abuse issues.

          Failure to assist mother following initial neglect voided subsequent parental rights termination.
         </b>
         - Where social services department simply sought termination of parental rights without first offering rehabilitation or other programs which would have assisted mother to regain custody of her children when and if released from police custody following her robbery arrest, it could not be determined whether in fact mother was unwilling or unable, if given the opportunity, to correct or eliminate the conditions which resulted in the initial neglect; thus, trial court's termination of her parental rights was reversed.

    - Nothing required that services be provided in all cases as a prerequisite to termination under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283; a child was abused and neglected when she was left alone with the father, because this violated the father's probation and parole. Credible evidence supported a trial court's order of termination of the father's parental rights. Seibert v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., No. 1158-06-4, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va.

     Requirements of subdivision B 2 met.
    </b>
    - Showing by Department of Social Services that mother of three infant daughters without good cause failed to respond to its rehabilitative efforts was prima facie evidence of the conditions set forth in subdivision B 2 of this section, and where the mother did not go forward with sufficient evidence to the contrary, the requirements of subdivision B 2 were proven.

         Evidence supported the termination of a father's parental rights to his two daughters under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 where, in addition to the fact that the father was incarcerated and would not be released until after the girls reached the age of majority, the evidence showed that the girls had been removed from their mother's custody due to abuse, the father had very little contact with the girls, and the father had failed to present any plan for care of the girls during their lengthy period of foster care.

        <p>
         Where the record was replete with evidence that a mother failed to maintain proper housing, placed her children in danger by driving with them while intoxicated, dated someone with a criminal record and a drinking problem, caused abuse and neglect to her children while they were in her custody, the children's cognitive health and development was stunted by her failures, and the mother's depression and anxiety problems continued to render her unable to parent her children, the trial court's order terminating her residual parental rights was upheld.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's rights to her two minor children was appropriate under subdivision B 2 because the children had significant special needs that could not be addressed with the mother's limited parenting skills and visitation with the mother had resulted in a founded complaint of physical abuse; evidence indicated that it was not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in the children's neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated.

         Termination of a parents' rights to a son under
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 B 2 a was supported by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the son's best interests based on the fact that the parent's prior neglect had heightened the possibility the son would commit suicide, the parent's current inability to parent, and the son's special parenting needs; there was no reasonable expectation that the parent would be able to undertake responsibility for the care needed by the son in accordance with the son's age and stage of development.

         Evidence that a father's children were in foster care for 18 months; that, due to parental abuse and neglect, they needed long-term continued and specialized treatment; and that removing them from foster care and returning them to their parents would be detrimental to their health, safety, and recovery, supported termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision B 2 of

         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated under subdivision B 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as: (1) although the mother participated in a substance abuse class in jail, she was unable to remedy her underlying substance abuse problems; (2) she was unable to provide a stable home environment for the child as she did not have an independent home for the child or a job to support the child; and (3) the mother was a slave to substance abuse and had never been able to take care of herself, much less her child. Owens v. Winchester Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 369</cite> (Nov. 20, 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's residual parental rights were properly terminated as the mother's continued substance abuse and refusal to address her alcohol abuse was prima facie evidence it was not reasonably likely she would correct the conditions that resulted in the children's neglect or abuse so the children could be safely returned to her custody; although the mother had made progress addressing her phencyclidine addiction and had made some attempts to follow the child services agency's recommendations, she failed to remedy the conditions that resulted in the children's neglect or abuse and subsequent removal during the 15 months the children were in foster care.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated the parent's parental rights because both parents abused drugs and/or alcohol, did not get a letter or certificate to show their progress in counseling, the father was arrested for domestic violence, and the evidence regarding the parents' previous terminations was not unduly prejudicial where the circuit court recognized that they improved their housing situation, which was an issue with their previous children.

        <p>
         Considering the totality of the evidence, the circuit court did not err in terminating the parental rights of a mother and a father pursuant to Va. Code Ann.
    
     §
    
    16.1-283(B)(2), as the evidence supported the trial court's rulings that the parents did not substantially remedy their underlying problems, which included mental or emotional issues. Carwile v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 6</cite> (Jan. 13, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights where she failed to appear for and complete scheduled parenting and anger management classes following her release from jail, she tested positive for drug use, her living arrangements were unclear, and the child had been in and out of foster care. Fields v. Russell Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0526-15-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 92</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 29, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supported a circuit court's finding that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interest because the mother did not participate in various evaluations and meetings in a meaningful manner when one of the mother's children had an acute outbreak of genital herpes, which the mother and the father of three of the four children contracted prior to the child becoming infected. Moreover, the mother never demonstrated the ability to provide a safe environment for the children. Velazquez v. Prince Edward Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0800-16-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 289</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 1, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights because, while her child suffered from neglect or abuse, it was also in the child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights for failure to remedy substantially the conditions that led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement where the mother had inadequate housing, was inconsistent with services, had substance abuse and mental health issues, and failed to improve her own inconsistent behaviors when she was informed that the child became dysregulated when she was not sure that the mother would follow through, and would decompensate, cry, be angry, and be aggressive in programming if the mother did not come. Davis v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0951-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 33</cite> (Feb. 13, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights to the mother's minor children was appropriate because, although the mother did make some efforts to correct the conditions that led to the children's removal and foster care placement, it was not reasonably likely that the mother would remedy the issues within a reasonable time. Furthermore, a county department of social services provided the mother with a number of services, but the mother declined to take advantage of them. Willoughby v. Albemarle Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1619-17-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 235</cite> (Aug. 28, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err by finding that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because it properly evaluated all of the mother's efforts to substantially correct or eliminate the conditions leading to the children's placement in foster care and concluded that she still did not have a stable living situation, her employment history was sporadic, and she had not completed therapy for domestic violence.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating mother's parental rights because the Department of Social Services presented extensive evidence of the family's history of domestic violence and the mother's mental illness, the Department had previously removed the children from the parents' custody and provided numerous services to the parents, the mother did not comply with the services offered and was never in a position to care for the children, the mother remained unstable and tested positive for drug use, and the children spent the majority of their lives in foster care.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that it was in the children's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights and that the evidence was sufficient to support termination under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 where the evidence proved that the department of social services had provided numerous services to mother over the years, but she had not availed herself of those services, the children were doing well in foster care with their paternal grandmother, but continued to need services, and the mother acknowledged that she was not able to care for them at the time of the circuit court hearing.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err by finding that termination of the parents' rights was in the children's best interest because they had been in foster care for two and a half years, they were receiving treatment and therapy to help them cope with their neglect, and the parents had made no serious attempts to regain custody even after a protective order expired. Whitmer v. Spotsylvania Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0903-20-2, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 46</cite> (Mar. 30, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the parents' rights because the evidence showed that when given the chance by the Department of Social Services to address the underlying substance abuse the parents refused, the Department offered supervised visitations but the parents attended less than a third of the possible visits, and they did not substantially remedy the conditions that led to the children's neglect. Whitmer v. Spotsylvania Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0903-20-2, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 46</cite> (Mar. 30, 2021).

    - Trial court erred when it determined that it was not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in the abuse could not be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child's return to the mother within a reasonable period of time because there was no evidence tending to suggest that the mother had an opportunity to demonstrate the mother was willing to eliminate the cause of the abuse; there was no evidence that the mother was offered any services or given any chance to demonstrate a willingness to eliminate the cause of the sexual abuse during the fewer than eight weeks after the mother denied the allegations, once the mother denied the sexual abuse allegations, no effort to work with the mother was made by the Department of Social Services.

As this section requires that the termination of parental rights promote the best interests of the child and that certain factors be present, a determination that these factors are present is tantamount to a finding of parental unfitness and renders a separate finding of parental unfitness unnecessary.

         - Subdivisions C 1 and C 2 provide that proof of the failure of the parents without good cause to communicate on a continuing or planned basis with the child for a period of 12 months, or proof of the failure or inability of the parents to make reasonable progress toward the elimination of the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement, constitutes prima facie evidence of the required conditions for termination.

         There was clear and convincing evidence in the record to support the finding of the trial court that the mother, without good cause, failed to maintain contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of 12 months after the child's placement in foster care, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of the agencies to communicate with the mother and to strengthen the parent-child relations, where the foster care plan provided for the mother to visit her son bimonthly, she did not maintain contact with the child or the agency on a regular basis, and visited the child only three times within the 12-month period, and there were ample services offered and available to the mother, but she chose not to take advantage of them. The law does not require the division to force its services upon an unwilling or disinterested parent. Barkey v. Commonwealth, Alexandria Dep't of Human Servs., 2 Va. App. 662, 347 S.E.2d 188 (1986).

         While the mother had achieved some of the goals identified for reunification, such as completing a parenting assessment and psychological assessment, and visiting the children, the termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that the mother continued her lifestyle of drugs, dealing drugs, and remaining involved with convicted felons. The mother also faced child abuse charges in Virginia and drug charges in Tennessee resulting in her being unable to resume her parenting duties. Welch v. Bristol Dep't of Soc.

         Both of the mother's older children were in need of special care that the mother could not provide, while the youngest child was progressing normally at a regular foster care home and was reported to be happy and healthy, and thus the circuit court had credible factual basis for distinguishing the youngest child from his siblings.

         Trial court based its decision on the fact that mother could not care for her child, or arrange for acceptable care for her child, within 12 months of the department receiving custody, and thus the trial court's decision to terminate mother's parental rights was not based solely on her incarceration, and the termination ruling was affirmed.

         Father was unable to plan for the future of the children during the six months after they entered foster care, as required, and the termination of the father's residual parental rights was proper; he did not avail himself of the department's referrals during the time the children were in foster care, and he was unable to establish that he had suitable housing for the children or stable employment by the time of the trial.

         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper as he had failed to provide or substantially plan for the future of his daughter for a period of six months after the child's placement in foster care because, in light of the father's history and the protective orders in existence because of his previous violent outbursts, the circuit court's determination that the father failed, without good cause, to communicate with his child was not plainly wrong; and, although the father testified that he recently obtained a two-bedroom apartment and furnished a bedroom for his child, no information relating to his new apartment was disclosed until the trial as he chose to cease communicating with the Bristol Department of Social Services.

         Mother's brief did not support her assignment of error to the trial court's decision to terminate her parental rights because it failed to present an argument supported by principles of law or authorities; the mother did not make any reference to the code section under which termination occurred, and the trial court's findings that the mother failed to maintain contact with her children and failed to remedy the conditions that led to their foster care placement corresponded to that section.

         Circuit court's decision to terminate a mother's parental rights to her children was supported by clear and convincing evidence, was in the best interests of the children, and was not plainly wrong because termination was warranted under subdivisions C 1 and 2; the mother failed to maintain contact with the children for six months after they entered foster care, and she failed to remedy within twelve months the conditions that led to foster care placement.

         Circuit court properly terminated a father's parental rights to his child and approved the foster care plan's goal of adoption because he had not maintained contact for the past six months or planned for the child's future, last saw the child when he was six months old, indicated that he wanted a paternity test to insure that the child was his, yet did not go to any of the appointments for paternity testing, had not visited the child, did not provide financial support for the child, did not come to any of the hearings until the termination hearing, and the child was thriving and doing very well in foster care and had a close relationship with his half-brother, who lived in the same foster home.

         Trial court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights, because the father had never met the child and had been incarcerated the child's entire life, had issues regarding substance abuse, was a violent sex offender and had not been at liberty long enough to establish that his treatment had been effective, and had been in jail, prison, or a motel room for years.

        <p>
         Circuit court's termination decision was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it because the mother had not demonstrated that she could remain sober outside of a sober-living residence, there was a lack of evidence the mother successfully completed domestic violence therapy, and she had not demonstrated an ability to maintain stable housing or employment outside of a sober-living residence.

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of

    16.1-283 was proper; the children were removed from the father's care in 2015 and 2017 after police conducted drug raids at his home, the father failed to take advantage of the services offered to him, the children were aware that he was using and distributing drugs, and at the time of termination, the father had no home for the children and they had been in foster care for 30 months.

         Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of a father's parental rights because the father's child was in foster care for approximately three years, the father was incarcerated multiple times, and the record did not indicate when the father expected to be released, the father did not comply with requirements of the county department of social services, and the father had very little contact with the child. Furthermore, the county department was not required to offer the father services while the father was incarcerated. Whitener v. Pulaski Cty. Dep't of Soc.

         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights and found that termination was in the children's best interests because, inter alia, the Department of Social Services started offering services to the family in 2016 due to concerns about the family's living situation, the children's hygiene problems, and lack of supervision, the situation did not improve, the mother never progressed to the point of having unsupervised visitations, the parents refused to cooperate with family stabilization services, the children had not been in the mother's care for approximately three years, and while in foster care, they received counseling, went to the doctor and dentist, and improved in school.

         Trial court did not err in finding that the Department of Social Services made reasonable and appropriate efforts and that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate mother's parental rights, as the child had been in foster care for more than two years, the mother was still incarcerated, and the mother had no definitive plan for the child upon her release from incarceration.

         Circuit court properly terminated the mother's parental rights because the child had not lived with mother since she was five years old, and, at the time of the circuit court hearing, the child was 11 years old; the child had been in foster care for approximately 15 months; the child had serious mental health problems that required hospitalization, she was in a residential treatment center, and there was evidence that she was expected to remain there for several months; the mother did not remove herself from an abusive relationship; the mother could not take care of herself and did not have stable living; and the mother was not in a position to care for the child, especially considering the child's special needs.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights and in finding that termination was in the children's best interests because, although a social services department attempted to provide services for years, ongoing abuse by the mother led to one child attempting suicide several times and criminal charges against the mother; the mother continued to deny abuse and the mother's role in the children's placement in foster care; and the mother was not in a position to visit the children, much less to resume custody of the children.

     Termination of rights denied.

    - Trial court's denial of a petition to terminate the residual parental rights was appropriate because evidence supported the trial court determinations that the parent was making sufficient progress and that it was not in the children's best interest to terminate the parent's parental rights. There was significant evidence that the parent had done everything that was requested by an administrative agency, was employed, had a stable residence, had completed at least two parenting classes, was in group therapy, and was keeping regular appointments with a psychiatrist.

    - Although a mother argued the circuit court erred in terminating her parental rights to her children because the city department of social services had not made reasonable efforts to reunite the children with her and had not provided her with reasonable and appropriate services, the mother did not develop these arguments.

     Failure to present argument.

    - Father's argument that the Department of Social Services failed to make reasonable and appropriate efforts to assist him was not properly preserved because the written statement of facts did not indicate that a timely objection was made in the circuit court; the written statement of facts only stated that father's attorney moved to strike the evidence on the reasoning that it was not in the best interests of the children and did not object to the final order.

     Factors bearing on best interests of child.

    - In determining what is in the best interests of the child, a court must evaluate and consider many factors, including; the age and physical and mental condition of the child or children, the age and physical and mental condition of the parents, the relationship existing between each parent and each child, the needs of the child or children, the role which each parent has played, and will play in the future, in the upbringing and care of the child or children, and such other factors as are necessary.

         Appellate court could not review father's challenge to the termination of his parental rights, as the father did not make any specific objections to the trial court's ruling; since the trial court's ruling could have been based on any number if factors, it was not narrow enough for the appellate court to make obvious the basis for the father's objection and did not permit the appellate court to properly review the trial court's ruling.

    16.1-283. McCoy v. Grayson County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2010 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 473</cite> (Dec. 7, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the identity of a child's father was not at issue in the termination proceedings, and because there was no indication that the father had any type of bond with the child, termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Brown v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 271</cite> (Aug. 23, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was appropriate pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because the trial court did not err in finding that the Department of Social Services proved by clear and convincing evidence that the mother had failed, without good cause, to make substantial progress towards eliminating the conditions requiring the continuation of the child's foster care within 12 months of the child's placement, and that termination of mother's residual parental rights was in the child's best interests.

         While the children were put in two different placements, that was in their best interests, given that the older son was aggressive with the older daughter, and the two sons had behavioral issues. Wooddell v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., Nos. 0316-16-3,

        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated the parental rights of a mother and father and approved the foster care goal of adoption because contrary to their arguments, the evidence supported the circuit court's finding that language was not a barrier, in spite of all of the services provided to the parents over the years, the mother and the father had not determined how to apply what they learned to interacting with their children, they repeatedly focused on how the placement of the children had affected them, as opposed to how their actions affected the children, and the children had been in foster care for almost two years, were doing well in foster care, and were either in an adoptive placement or a possible adoptive placement. De Jesus Martinez v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., Nos. 0090-18-3, 0097-18-3, 0578-18-3, 0579-18-3, 0580-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 271</cite> (Oct. 16, 2018).

    - Although the Department of Social Services established that a mother neglected her children and, without good cause, failed to respond to the department's rehabilitative efforts, these findings standing alone were insufficient as a matter of law to support the termination of the mother's parental rights in the absence of an explicit finding that such a drastic action would be in the best interests of the children.

     Termination in best interest of child.
    </b>
    - Termination of parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the children's best interests as the special needs of the children required that they be placed in a structured environment, and the evidence showed that the children's continued contact with their parents clearly was detrimental to their progress in managing their behavioral issues. Taylor v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2010 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 471</cite> (Dec. 7, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence showed that termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the best interests of her son because the son was thriving in the care of his foster family, who wanted to adopt him and for more than two years while the son was in foster care the mother did nothing to substantially remedy the conditions that required the continuation of his placement. The evidence showed that: (1) the mother's employment status was unclear; (2) her housing situation was unstable; (3) the mother had not obtained the therapy that a psychologist opined was necessary; (4) she failed to complete parenting classes; and (5) she failed to participate fully in the visitation opportunities provided to her. Fauber v. Shenandoah Valley Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 38</cite> (Feb. 8, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's decision to terminate a parent's parental rights to two children pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, as termination was in the best interests of both children; the children were thriving in the care of their foster families, and the mother's parenting skills had not progressed. Haskins v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 200</cite> (June 7, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the parental rights of a mother and father was in the children's best interests because, while both parents testified to their love for the children and took steps to become better parents, the record fully supported the finding that the parents had been unable within a reasonable period of time to remedy substantially the conditions that led to the placement of the children in foster care. The mother and the children lived in unsanitary conditions, she did not have steady employment, she was unable to provide necessary care, both parents had significant personality disorders, the father continued to abuse marijuana, and the children were thriving with their foster families, who wished to adopt them. Jackson v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 279</cite> (Sept. 6, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because clear and convincing evidence that termination of a father's parental rights was in the children's best interest was adequately supported by the record, and because the father had not timely availed himself of the services offered to him within 12 months, termination was proper under subsection C. Lee v. Fredericksburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2217-10-2, 2011 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 252</cite> (Aug. 2, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence proved that termination of a mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the best interests of the children as the record showed that the children had been in foster care for more than three years, that the children were happy and thriving in their foster home, that they had bonded with the foster parents, that the mother was unemployed and unequipped to provide a suitable home for the children, and that the mother was unwilling to separate from her husband, whose parental rights to the children had been terminated.

        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to show that termination of parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the best interest of each of the parties' children, as the parents had both failed to complete individual therapy despite opportunities to do so, and both parents presented a risk of physical or sexual abuse to the children.

        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence proved the factors required for termination under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, including that termination was in the best interests of the children, as they had been in foster care for more than one and one-half years, they were thriving in their foster home, and their parent was incarcerated at the time of termination hearing and was not expected to be released for more than three years, at the earliest.

         It was in the children's best interest that the parents' residual parental rights be terminated pursuant to subsection C of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because the parents were unwilling or unable to respond to or follow through with the rehabilitative efforts that were offered to them, made no effort to maintain contact with the children for over one and one-half years, and failed to plan for the children's future, and a great-grandmother and aunt did not take the necessary steps to ensure placement in their homes. Logan v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 296</cite> (Sept. 11, 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was proper as the evidence showed the mother had been unwilling or unable to remedy the conditions that led to or required continuation of the children's foster care placement and that termination was in the best interests of the children. The children had been in and out of foster care since 2002, she had supervisory issues with the children for years and showed little improvement in that area, she continued to use alcohol and had not completed recommended substance abuse treatment, she failed to complete treatment for her mental health issues, she was unemployed at the time of the hearing, she continued to have a relationship with her boyfriend despite the fact that he had abused two of her children and also had substance abuse issues, and the children were improving in foster care.

         Trial court did not err in finding that termination of a father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the children's best interests because, although the father visited with the children while they were in foster care, he did not participate in any parenting classes or obtain suitable housing.

     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported where: (1) the child was thriving in the foster family's care; (2) his behavior was significantly improved, and he had a strong bond with his siblings who had been adopted by the foster parents; and (3) although the parents were engaging in a more positive manner with the child and his foster parents, they did not show they had improved their circumstances sufficiently to maintain their parental rights.

         Clear and convincing proof demonstrated the conditions required for termination of a mother's residual parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, and termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the children because the evidence proved that the children, who lived together in a foster home, were thriving since removal from the mother's custody, and the foster parents desired to adopt the children. Orum v. Buckingham County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2350-12-2, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 166</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 4, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights was in the child's best interest as the child had been in foster care for almost three years, the mother was not making sufficient progress to remedy the conditions that precipitated foster care placement, the child was continuing to thrive with his foster parents, and none of the service providers and specialists who observed the mother and the child could recommend returning the child to the mother.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests as the child was doing well in foster care, he had become attached to his foster parents, the mother continued to struggle with anger issues despite treatment, and she was unable to show that she could meet the child's emotional needs. Mikhail v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 0215-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 209</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 23, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in terminating the mother's residual parental rights because clear and convincing evidence proved that termination of the mother's rights was in the child's best interests because, at the time of the termination hearing, the child had already been in foster care for well over twelve months, and the mother was unwilling or unable to remedy the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care by failing to maintain safe, stable, and adequate housing for the child.

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating mother's and father's parental rights, and approving the goal of adoption, because, although the parents had made improvements in their lives, it took them a long time and they were not in a position to care for the children. The children, who both had serious issues, were doing well in foster care, needed stability, and it was not in their best interest to wait. McDorman v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., Nos. 0885-13-3,

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was in the best interests of her children because the county department of family services satisfied its duty to investigate the children's available relatives as placement options, the relatives either failed to cooperate with the investigation or indicated they did not want to be considered as placement options, and the trial court considered all viable alternatives. Luseni v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 1003-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 309</cite> (Oct. 29, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Children were more stable and improving in their foster homes, both potential adoption homes, and the guardian ad litem opined that returning the children to the father's custody would cause the children to regress, and the record contained sufficient evidence that termination was in the children's best interests. Hensley v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 103</cite> (Mar. 18, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights for failing to remedy conditions was in the best interest of two children because the mother never sought visitation after it was suspended in July 2011, the mother never acknowledged one child's leg was broken by her boyfriend, and the children were doing well in foster care. Sullivan v. Fredericksburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 119</cite> (Apr. 1, 2014).

        <p>
         Evidence showed that a father was often absent, failed to protect his two children from neglect, and failed to make sure the children made it to their medical appointments; the circuit court did not err in finding that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the father's residual parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Cerda v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 253</cite> (July 1, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to show that termination of the mother's parental rights was in her children's best interests because they had extensive medical and physical needs and they thrived in foster care, and the mother had no understanding of her children's medical needs given her significant cognitive difficulties from her extensive drug abuse. Fabian-Cerda v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 254</cite> (July 1, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests because the mother demonstrated she was unable to care for the child as she had a history of substance abuse and mental health problems and was incarcerated for a domestic violence conviction; she did not complete all the treatment programs required of her and failed to maintain stable housing upon her release from the hospital for a heroin overdose; she admitted using drugs after her release from the hospital, and the doctor's testimony indicated the mother was at a high risk of relapsing; at the time of the trial, the child had been in foster care for more than two years; and the child was doing well in foster care. McKie v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 296</cite> (Sept. 2, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the child and that the requirements of subsection C 2 were met because the mother failed to obtain suitable independent housing for herself and the child, who was in foster care; the child was thriving in his foster home, and the foster family was a potential adoptive family for him. Hareford v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 346</cite> (Oct. 21, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Record supported the conclusion that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interest of two of the children, as the children had been in foster care for over two years, the mother had not completed parenting classes and remained behind on rent and utility payments despite receiving financial assistance, and the mother had mental health issues. Holmes v. City of Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 369</cite> (Nov. 4, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the circuit court relied on appropriate factors and pointed to some evidence supporting its decision, the circuit court's best interests determination was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Welch, 64 Va. App. 34, 764 S.E.2d 284, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 365</cite> (Nov. 4, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Appellants could not prevail simply by proving that the mother failed to comply with the requirements of the third subsection of the statute; appellants had to show that as a matter of law, the circuit court erred in finding that termination was not in the best interests of the child, but appellants failed to do so. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Welch, 64 Va. App. 34, 764 S.E.2d 284, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 365</cite> (Nov. 4, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the mother claimed the trial court erred in finding that it was in the child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights, the trial court did not err in terminating her rights, given in part that there was no evidence that the mother would be able to care for the child when she was released from prison, which was more than one year away, she did not have a relationship with the child, who had bonded with her foster family, the mother was not capable of providing a safe home for the child, and no relatives were available to take custody. Lindsey v. Stafford Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 14</cite> (Jan. 20, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in denying a father's request for a continuance and in terminating his parental rights because the father failed to show he was prejudiced by the denial of the continuance where he had more than one year to provide relative placement names prior to the trial court hearing and admitted that he was responsible for the lack of communication that resulted in his failure to provide additional names, the Department of Social Services sent letters to 42 relatives of the child's parents looking for a suitable relative placement for the child, the father had not completed the services offered by the Department, and the child had been in foster care for over two years. Andrews v. Roanoke County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 154</cite> (May 5, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the children, given in part that the mother was unable to provide the children with a stable home and the care required to meet their needs, and the children were doing well in foster care.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that terminating the mother's rights was in the child's best interests, given that the child was thriving in foster care, the mother only visited him on seven occasions during the first two years he was in foster care, and prior to his removal, the child was not enrolled in school and the mother displayed alarming behavior in the child's presence.

        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence supported the termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 where an unstable home environment led to the child's removal at the age of two months, the father had only one visit with her due to either his continued drug use or incarceration, the child was thriving in her foster home, which was a potential adoptive placement for her, and the father faced years of incarceration and had no ability to provide a home for the child in the foreseeable future. Guill v. Campbell Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1028-15-3, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 366</cite> (Dec. 8, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a father's residual parental rights to his two children because termination was in the best interests of the children where the father's involvement in the distribution of drugs ultimately led to the children's removal from his care, the father was subsequently convicted and faced years of incarceration, he had no ability to provide a home for his children for the foreseeable future, the father admitted to drug use and addiction, and the children had special needs. Borden v. Roanoke Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1548-15-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 60</cite> (Feb. 23, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in determining that adoption was in the best interests of the child, as the mother failed to remedy the circumstances that led to the child's placement in foster care for almost two years, the mother lacked stable housing and employment, she failed to maintain her sobriety or treat her mental health conditions, and the foster parents wanted to adopt the child. Howe v. Albemarle Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 0703-15-2, 0704-15-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 46</cite> (Feb. 16, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights was in a child's best interest because the parent had not substantially remedied the conditions that led to the child being in, and remaining in, foster care as the parent had a history of drug abuse, did not have stable housing at the time of the trial court hearing, and had an employment situation that was questionable at best. In addition, the child was doing well in foster care and had bonded with the foster family who wanted to adopt the child, while the parent had not visited the child in more than a year. Allen v. Henrico Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1746-15-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 161</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 17, 2016).

         Trial court did not err by determining that the requirements of this section were met and that termination of the mother's parental rights was in her child's best interests where it showed that Newport News Department of Human Services offered numerous services designed to reunify the mother with her child, the mother exhibited uncooperative behavior, she did not obtain a psychiatric evaluation, she was unemployed and had no stable housing, the child had been in foster care for almost two years, and his foster home was a potential adoptive placement. Mooney v. Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0439-16-1, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 244</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 20, 2016).

        <p>
         Termination of the father's rights was justified; the children had special needs that required consistency and structure that the father could not give, he could not establish that he had regular employment or a stable residence, and he failed to accept assistance from the department. Burton v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0958-16-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 53</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 28, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the circuit court relied on appropriate factors and pointed to evidence supporting its decision, its best interests determination was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it; the circuit court discussed the mother's inability to meet the children's special needs and their necessity for permanency, and given that the best interests analysis was highly fact-sensitive and discretionary, overturning its decision would improperly substitute the circuit court's judgment. Stanley v. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 1189-16-3, 1449-16-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 92</cite> (Mar. 28, 2017).

        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because termination was in the child's best interest as the father, who was incarcerated, was not able to care for the child, and there was no indication of when, or if, the father would be able to care for the child. Furthermore, the evidence proved that the father did not take advantage of the services offered to the father prior to the father's incarceration. Mason v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 0149-17-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 176</cite> (July 25, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the evidence showed ample support for its determination that termination was in the best interests of the children; the children were in a household where drug use and domestic violence appeared frequent and prevalent, the family had difficulty in finding stable housing, and the father had past difficulty providing a stable and safe household for the children.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 where although the parents had cleaned up their home, the autistic child had been removed for a multitude of reasons, the father continued to have physical limitations and depression that impacted his ability to care for the child, the mother's limited cognitive disability affected her decision-making and problem-solving skills, especially as related to the child's needs, and the child was doing well and improving.

         Evidence supported the trial court's ruling that it was in the child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights and approving the foster care plan's goal of adoption because despite counseling and testing she refused to acknowledge that she had a mental illness and would not take medication, she planned to move out of the area with the child, her housing situation was precarious, her income was insufficient to cover her living expenses, and the child had been in foster care 12 months, he had been improving, and he needed a stable home.

        </p>
        <p>
         Local social services agency presented sufficient evidence to support termination of the father's parental rights where he chose to reoffend multiple times rather than engaging in recommended services or remedying the agency's concerns as to housing and stability, and although he had found employment and asserted he was currently drug-free, the efforts were simply too late.

         In upholding a circuit court's decision to terminate a father's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §

         It was in the best interests of a child to terminate the father's parental rights as the father was incarcerated and had a history of criminal behavior and the child, who had behavioral, educational, emotional, and medical needs, had been in foster care for approximately 20 months and had bonded with the foster mother Whiting v. Gloucester Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0401-18-1, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 195</cite> (July 17, 2018).

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding that it was in the child's best interests to terminate the father's parental rights where the evidence showed that the father did not have any contact with the child for six months, the father had not developed a plan for the child's care until a few months earlier, and the father had a criminal history, failed to attend the required individual counseling, had numerous addresses, and had an unstable relationship with the mother.

        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to prove that it was in a child's best interest to terminate the father's parental rights and to approve the goal of adoption because the father did not complete recommended counseling; the father did not have appropriate housing for the child and all of the child's medical equipment; the child was improving in foster care, but still had numerous medical issues; and the father, despite a social services agency's efforts, was not prepared to care for the child at the time of the circuit court hearing.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that the evidence was sufficient to terminate a father's parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 and termination of parental rights was in the child's best interests where he contacted the county department of family services only once while the child was in foster care, he had no plans for the child other than the rejected plan to live with the child's mother or grandmother, and it was unclear how long he was to be incarcerated on his pending charges. Johnson v. Fairfax Cty. Dep't of Family Servs., No. 0628-18-4, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 4</cite> (Jan. 8, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         The circuit court properly terminated a mother's residual because termination was in the best interests of the children where the mother had not substantially remedied the conditions leading to the children's removal, they were doing well in foster care, and movement toward permanency and safety was in their best interests, which meant termination of parental rights to facilitate adoption. Ansell v. Harrisonburg/Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 0765-18-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 13</cite> (Jan. 15, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a father's parental rights and approved the foster care goal of adoption because the father's arguments at trial focused solely on the request for the mother's parental rights not to be terminated, the father never presented any evidence or any argument regarding the termination of his parental rights or that the Department of Social Services failed to meet the statutory criteria for the permanency plan. Walker v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 50</cite> (Mar. 5, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that the termination of the mother's parental rights was in the best interests of the children because the children had been in foster care for seventeen months, and the evidence proved that the children had significant behavioral issues; the mother was not in a position to care for them and their special needs.

        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate a mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 because the mother did not comply with any of the requirements of the department of human services with respect to the child, the mother had no contact with the child the entire time the child was in foster care, and the mother had never had custody of the child. Hobson v. City of Virginia Beach Dep't of Human Servs., Nos. 1980-18-1, 0260-19-1, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 146</cite> (June 25, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because the mother was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the children being placed in foster care as the mother's significant cognitive limitations and lack of insight into how to provide for the children's needs could not be remediated through parent training, in-home services, or medication. Furthermore, the children improved significantly while in foster care for 17 months and were in a potentially adoptive home. Lephew v. Roanoke Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1822-18-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 180</cite> (July 30, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was in the children's best interests, as the children had been in foster care for 24 months, they had special needs and were doing well in their current home, and the father was not in a position to assume custody at the time of the hearing. Hammock v. Halifax Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0161-19-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 57</cite> (Mar. 3, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that termination was in the children's best interests because the father had not demonstrated that he could provide for and safely parent the children, and both children were doing well and thriving in foster care. Dorestal v. City of Fredericksburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0123-20-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 210</cite> (July 21, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper and in the child's best interests because the circuit court adopted the guardian ad litem's recommendations, including that it would be detrimental if the child were placed back in the father's care; the circuit court found that the child had grown, done well, and made progress over the 19 months she had been in foster care; the father admittedly did not complete the anger management classes and participated in only a few counseling sessions; and he never demonstrated that he could provide for the child and care for her in a safe, healthy manner. Khadi v. Wythe Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0174-20-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 235</cite> (Sept. 29, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights to four of her children and approving the foster care goal of adoption was proper and in the children's best interests because the mother failed to obtain and maintain suitable housing for her and the children; she had tested positive for methamphetamines and amphetamines in December 2018, nine months after the children entered foster care; she had not completed substance abuse counseling; the Buchanan County Department of Social Services presented evidence that the children were doing well in foster care, but they had special needs, which required counseling and other services; and the mother had not demonstrated that she was capable of caring for the children. Potts v. Buchanan Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1067-20-3, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 32</cite> (Mar. 2, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest because the child had been in foster care for all but a few weeks of his life and the father admittedly was not in a position to care for the child at the time of the circuit court hearing. Huff v. City of Fredericksburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0843-20-2, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 16</cite> (Feb. 2, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a father's parental rights to his children because the ends of justice exception did not apply where there was sufficient evidence to prove that termination of his parental rights was in the children's best interests since the family had been involved with social services since 2006, received "extensive services" over the years, an evaluator opined that the prognosis for reunification was "extremely poor" and that the father's failure to protect was as "damaging" to the children as mother's abuse, and an expert in forensic psychology also opined that reunification efforts would be futile and found that the children would not be safe with the father.

    - Prima facie case for termination of parental rights under subdivision C 1
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was established by evidence that although transportation had been offered and visitations had been scheduled, a father failed without good cause to communicate on a continuing and planned basis with his child for a period of six months.

        <p>
         Parental rights of a parent were properly terminated under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as: (1) the parent failed to find appropriate housing, to comply with the services offered by an independent contractor working with the department of social services (DSS), and to complete a parenting class or anger management program; (2) despite the contractor's extraordinary efforts to provide the parent with income and transportation, the parent refused to perform readily available work and failed to abide by the conditions established for the use of the contractor's vehicle; and (3) the parent had an anger management issue, and admitted to DSS that the parent was afraid of "losing it" in the child's presence.

        <p>
         Because a father had no contact with his child for 15 months, demonstrated no ability to live independently, completed none of the programs and services required by his foster care service plan or recommended by a doctor, the trial court properly found that termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in his child's best interests. Miller v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 128</cite> (Mar. 24, 2009).

         In a case in which a mother had not been in contact with her four-and-one-half-year-old son for more than two years, sufficient evidence supported the circuit court's order terminating her residual parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §

         Considering all the facts and circumstances, there was clear and convincing evidence to prove the factors required for termination of a mother's parental rights, pursuant to subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, where at the time of the termination hearing, the mother, who was incarcerated on a forgery conviction in Florida, had maintained no contact with the child for fourteen months and where the child was thriving in a foster home and the child's ongoing medical condition was being managed successfully.

        <p>
         Because a father failed to maintain contact with his children and never accepted the reasonable and appropriate efforts for reunification made by the Department of Human Services, the father's parental rights were properly terminated pursuant to subsection C.

         It was not error to terminate a father's parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because clear and convincing evidence showed (1) the father had no contact with the child since the child was placed in foster care, despite visits being arranged, (2) the father refused further recommended treatment, and (3) the child was thriving in foster care.

         Termination of the mother's parental rights was not error because the mother's future plans for the children were not viable since they involved the live-in boyfriend. Although there was evidence that they intended to marry and raise the children together, the protective order prohibited the mother from allowing the children to have contact with the boyfriend.

         Trial court properly terminated a the mother's parental rights because the termination was in the children's best interests where the mother had the opportunity to present evidence and argument at trial, but did not do so, she had had no contact with her children from December 2013 to February 2015, and the social services department did not know her whereabouts except that she was supposedly in Florida.

         Father, without good cause, failed to maintain contact with the child or to provide for or substantially plan for her future for six months after her foster care placement where his contact with the county department of social services (DSS) was sporadic and only in response to outreach by DSS, and he moved after a home study without informing DSS.

         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper; the social services department was not required to offer him services while he was incarcerated, the department met with him three times and reviewed the foster care plan before he was incarcerated again, he did not visit the children when he had a chance to do so, he had not seen them in two years, and he did not contact the department or the children while he was incarcerated for 17 months.

    - Evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that the county welfare agency provided the father with all reasonable and appropriate services as required by
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 prior to terminating his parental rights in his son; the trial court had to determine under the facts and circumstances what efforts were reasonable and appropriate, and the fact that the father was incarcerated or hospitalized for mental illness for most of the son's life had to be taken into account because it hampered most of the county welfare agency's efforts to provide any services to father at all.

     Incarceration.

    - In a case where the father was incarcerated awaiting execution pursuant to a death sentence entered following a conviction for murder, the termination of the father's parental rights was upheld where the court determined that the Department of Social Service's actions were reasonable under the circumstances and that the father's incarceration limited the agency's capacity to remedy his deficiencies as a parent; thus, the Department fulfilled its duties under subsdivision C 2 of

         Based on a father's failure to maintain contact with his child since the child was placed in foster care, notwithstanding the department's reasonable and appropriate efforts to communicate with him, the father's ongoing incarceration, including the fact that the father would be incarcerated for five or six additional years, and the child's progress and status in his pre-adoptive home, an order terminating the father's parental rights was proper; further, notwithstanding the father's testimony to the contrary, the trial court, as fact finder, was entitled to conclude that the father received at least some of the foster care service plans sent to him, and yet made no contact with the child or the department until about three years later when he sent one letter to the child.

         Termination of a parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 1 of

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was proper, where evidence introduced by the Department of Social Services showed that the father, who was in prison, had not contacted the children for about two years and there was a major concern as to the father's history of domestic violence involving the mother, with whom the father hoped to be reunited upon being released from prison.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was proper; the department's records showed a lack of contact for over one year, and, while the father claimed that the records were suspect, the father's testimony was conflicting. The father also claimed that his incarceration affected his ability to seek rehabilitative services, but the father made no efforts to contact the department before his incarceration, and, after he was incarcerated, the father further hindered his ability to obtain any services by incurring several disciplinary infractions and being transferred to solitary confinement.

        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was supported by evidence that the father was incarcerated the entire time the children were in foster care and while the father was denied visitation while incarcerated, the father was encouraged to contact the children but failed to do so.

     Grounds for termination under subdivision C 2.
    </b>
    - Under subdivision C 2, the residual parental rights of a parent of a child placed in foster care may be terminated only if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) termination is in the best interests of the child; (2) the parent, without good cause, has been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period not exceeding twelve months to substantially remedy the conditions that led to or required the continuation of the child's foster care placement; and (3) the parent failed to remedy the conditions notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of rehabilitative agencies. Walker v. Virginia Beach Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0505-00-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 825</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 19, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Order terminating a mother's residual parental rights in four of her children was upheld, despite the mother's contentions that she made substantial progress to remedy the conditions which led to the foster care placement of the children, where the evidence established that the Department of Social Services made reasonable and appropriate efforts to help mother remedy her 20-year drug addiction, obtain and remain susceptive to counseling, and cease a violent relationship she had with a man despite a protective order prohibiting contact between the children and the man. Sales v. Alexandria Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0250-03-4, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 407</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 22, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence established that the teenage mother pursued an unstable lifestyle, incompatible with the child's needs and reflective of an indifference to the child's interests, that conduct spanning the child's entire life, despite the best efforts and substantial resources of the Department of Social Services, to assist and redirect the mother in the mother's behavior and parenting skills with numerous case plans and foster care placements, thus, the department proved by clear and convincing evidence, that termination was the appropriate remedy. DeHart v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0057-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 538</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 28, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the evidence presented by the Department of Social Services demonstrated that a father remedied many of the conditions required of him in order to be reunited with his children, including finding appropriate housing, maintaining employment, and increasing his income, despite his need for individual therapy, the trial court's order granting his motion to strike and dismissing petitions to terminate his parental rights were both supported by sufficient evidence.

        </p>
        <p>
         Because a mother was unwilling or unable to follow through with services provided to her prior to her incarceration, her incarceration, expert opinions, and the child's current status in a pre-adoptive home, termination of the mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the child's best interests. Harder v. Campbell County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 425</cite> (Sept. 19, 2006).

        <p>
         Record contained credible evidence to support a finding that termination of a parent's residual parental rights was in the best interests of each of the parent's children and that the requirements of subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 had been proven. The trial court heard extensive testimony from Alexandria Department of Human Services personnel, the foster parents, a therapist, and psychologists, revealing the special needs and circumstances of each child, and the parent's inability to effectively parent them without substantial and ongoing assistance.

         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of

    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that, inter alia, the mother failed to remedy the mother's shelter problem; while the mother outlined four housing options, all relied on the children's stepfather and maternal grandmother, neither of whom indicated they were willing to provide help to the mother.

         Mother's parental rights to her seven children were properly terminated under subdivision C 2 of

         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, was supported by the fact that for 12 months following the children's removal, the mother did virtually nothing to remedy the circumstances of neglect, domestic violence, and substance abuse, and mother failed to provide evidence of permanent plans with regard to the children's care.

        <p>
         Although termination of a mother's parental rights under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was improper because there was no allegation of abuse or neglect, termination under subdivision C 2 was proper because the mother was unable to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care and the mother did not live up to her obligations as set forth in the foster care plan filed by the court.

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of

         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of

         Father's parental rights to two children were properly terminated under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as the evidence showed that the agency had been involved with the family intermittently for over five years, that the agency had offered numerous services to the father to no avail, that the father refused to cooperate with the agency, that he had problems with alcoholism and anger toward others, that he claimed to suffer from numerous physical ailments that affected his ability to provide stability for the children, that he did not regularly visit the children, and that he refused to accept any responsibility for his actions that led to the children being placed in foster care. On the other hand, the children were doing well in foster care; the two younger children expressed their wish that the father's parental rights be terminated, and the oldest expressed his wish that he be placed in permanent foster care.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the parents' parental rights was appropriate pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because the parents continued to live in a hotel, they never applied their knowledge of caring for children with special needs, the foster mothers' testimony proved that the children's needs were great, and the father continued to have anger issues.

        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was appropriate because, despite the efforts of the Department of Social Services, the mother was unwilling or unable to remedy substantially the conditions that led to and required the continuation of the children's foster care placement. The Department had been involved with mother's family for about eight years; a social worker testified the family had a history of physical and medical neglect, lack of supervision, drug use, criminal charges, and issues of instability and improper boundaries between the parents and children; and the mother had repeatedly failed to complete drug treatment opportunities before and after the children were removed from her care.

         Because a father was incarcerated, did not seek services to address his alcohol issues on his own, and refused to sign a service plan offered by the Department of Social Services, and because the children were doing well in foster care, the father's parental rights were properly terminated pursuant to

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights to the oldest child was appropriate, because, although the mother met many of the department's requirements, the mother failed to meet the housing requirement, the employment requirement, and, most importantly, failed to demonstrate an ability to effectively parent the oldest child and keep that child safe and secure. The greatest weight was placed on the oldest child's special needs and the mother's inability to parent him, where that child had been sexually abused and exhibited sexually aggressive behavior and inappropriate sexual knowledge for a nine-year-old, which the mother was unable to deal with.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 was supported by evidence that father did not follow through with family therapy recommended by parenting capacity evaluation, the father missed a substantial number of visitation appointments, and on the occasions the father did appear, the father did not interact with child and often fell asleep. In addition, despite extensive services from the Department of Human Services, the father failed to secure stable employment or housing due to his failure to obtain identification and his felony record.

        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to terminate a mother's parental rights on the basis of failure to remedy conditions because the mother continued to abuse illegal substances despite the services she received, and the evidence at trial demonstrated the mother's pattern of lying to doctors and Department personnel. The mother specifically admitted that she did not tell a doctor about the child's fall down the stairs, and the trial court made a prospective judgment about the mother's ability to remedy the conditions leading to the children's removal.

    16.1-283 as the uncontroverted evidence showed that, despite sexual abuse counseling where the mother learned the signs of sexual abuse, she continued to allow the father to interact with the children; she failed to protect her children from him; she continued to have a sexual relationship with him; and she violated a court order prohibiting the father from being in the residence when she allowed him to sleep at the residence, left him alone with the children, permitted him to bathe the children he had sexually abused, and permitted him to sleep in the same bed as one of the children. The agency provided various counseling services and offered other services for assistance with food, medical care, and daycare for the children, but the mother failed to follow through with the offered services. Beard v. Halifax County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 252</cite> (Aug. 7, 2012).

        <p>
         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as: (1) the Winchester Department of Social Services had offered the mother several opportunities to participate in substance abuse treatment, but she did not attend the outpatient program, and she left the inpatient program twice against therapeutic advice; (2) the mother had tested positive for cocaine, opiates, and marijuana, and was charged with numerous drug-related offenses after the child was in foster care; and (3) the mother did not show that she had remedied her situation and was capable of taking care of the child. Owens v. Winchester Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2012 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 369</cite> (Nov. 20, 2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to terminate the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because, despite 225 hours of supervised visits between the mother and the children, she was not able to bond with the children, and the children's therapists testified that the mother did not have an attachment relationship with the children. Washington v. Fredericksburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 14</cite> (Jan. 15, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the Department of Family Services offered the mother significant services but the mother failed to advance to unsupervised visitation, failed to adequately address substance abuse issues, and was unable to organize, provide stability, or place the child's needs first. Pinto v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 58</cite> (Feb. 26, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the mother lost her job at a restaurant and was babysitting at her parents' house, the mother had rented a room so that she could tell the court she had a separate residence, and the mother was having difficulty obtaining her G.E.D. because the classes were "hard." She faced additional problems because she was an undocumented immigrant. Benitez v. Arlington County Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1839-12-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 21, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court was not plainly wrong in determining that the mother had been afforded a reasonable amount of time to remedy the conditions as the record showed that the child was continuously in foster care for almost three years. Gibson v. Wise County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2309-12-3, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 181</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 11, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err by terminating the mother's residual parental rights based on her failure to substantially remedy the conditions that led to foster placement of the child as the mother showed that she could not consistently apply what she learned in anger management, substance abuse, and counseling nor could she maintain a stable household. Gibson v. Wise County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2309-12-3, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 181</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 11, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was sufficient evidence to prove that the mother was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care and that the Department of Family Services had provided appropriate services to mother as the evidence showed that the mother continued to struggle with anger issues and uncontrolled rage despite being provided anger management services and that she had a history of being hostile toward the social worker. Mikhail v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 0215-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 209</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 23, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Sufficient evidence supported termination of a mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because (1) the mother's claims of insufficient notice of the proceedings lacked merit, (2) the mother was infrequently involved in the case and, in the beginning, the mother's involvement was too inconsistent for visitation, and (3) the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the mother failed to maintain continuing contact with and substantially plan for the future of the child within the six months after the child's placement in foster care, despite the mother's alleged present ability to care for the child. Tackett v. Arlington County Dep't of Human Servs., 62 Va. App. 296, 746 S.E.2d 509, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 226</cite> (2013).

        <p>
         It was not error to terminate a father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because clear and convincing evidence showed (1) the father refused further recommended treatment for unresolved anger issues, (2) the child was thriving in foster care, (3) the father did not maintain stable housing and employment, and (4) the father committed crimes while the child was in foster care. Martinez v. City of Portsmouth Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0739-13-1, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 24, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated due to his failure to remedy the conditions that led to the children's removal in a reasonable time since the child services agency made reasonable and appropriate efforts to assist the father, including by supplying him with services to help him obtain and maintain appropriate housing, yet he became homeless and he was incarcerated at the time of the hearing, and by assisting him with therapeutic visitation and counseling, yet he made no progress toward appropriate interaction or behavior with his children. Daniels v. Culpeper County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1133-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 328</cite> (Nov. 12, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating the father's parental rights, because there was sufficient evidence to prove that the father was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care and that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interests; despite having twenty-seven months, the father had been unable to remedy the situation that led to the child being placed in foster care. Elyass v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., Nos. 0667-13-4, 0684-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 345</cite> (Nov. 26, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Sufficient evidence supported terminating a mother's and a father's parental rights to six children on grounds of failing to remedy conditions because the parents were unable to maintain adequate housing, the father lacked stable employment and could not provide sufficient financial support for the family, the mother was unemployed, and neither parent was able to adequately address their mental health needs; the children had been in foster care for twenty-five months. Dewberry v. Winchester Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 0923-13-4, 0960-13-4, 2013 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 365</cite> (Dec. 10, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father was provided with multiple services, but lacked appropriate parenting skills and failed to exhibit much change in his ability to care for the children, and thus the father failed to demonstrate his ability within a reasonable time to remedy the conditions that led to placement. Hensley v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 103</cite> (Mar. 18, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a parent's parental rights because the court did not err in finding that the evidence was clear and convincing that the parent, who was incarcerated, had been unable or unwilling to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the placement of the children in foster care, that an additional six months would not change the situation, and that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate the parent's parental rights. Sexton v. Dickenson County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 144</cite> (Apr. 15, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights because the children needed permanency; the children had physical and mental health problems, and the mother refused many services that would have improved her situation. Redd v. Loudoun County Dep't of Family Servs., Nos. 1915-13-4, 1991-13-4, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 156</cite> (Apr. 29, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's actions in the almost two years following his children's placement in foster care demonstrated the father's inability or unwillingness to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the placement. The trial court did not err by terminating the father's residual parental rights to the children pursuant to this section. Douglas v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 167</cite> (May 6, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Department provided reasonable and appropriate services to mother and father and there was clear evidence that they were unwilling or unable to remedy the problems during the period in which they were offered services, including visitation; there was sufficient evidence supporting the circuit court's decision to terminate the parental rights of mother and father. McGhee v. Henrico Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 272</cite> (July 29, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         During the months the mother was on bond prior to her incarceration, she missed various meetings and her visitations with the children were sporadic, and the children had been in foster care for approximately two years; the evidence proved that the mother was unable to remedy substantially the conditions that led to or required continuation of the children's foster care placement within a reasonable period of time, and the trial court did not err in terminating her parental rights. Dennis v. York-Poquoson Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 267</cite> (July 29, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's decision to terminate a mother's parental rights to her children because the department of human resources provided reasonable and appropriate services to the mother, but she was unwilling or unable to remedy the problems; the children had been in foster care for two years and nine months at the time of the hearing, and the mother had several issues with unsupervised visitation and failed to maintain stable housing and employment. Amirah Alfarqui v. Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., Nos. 0469-14-1, 0470-14-1, 0471-14-1, 0473-14-1, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 324</cite> (Sept. 23, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights because the county department of social services provided reasonable and appropriate efforts to assist her in remedying the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement, and the mother was incarcerated, had a history of drug abuse, had been diagnosed with traumatic stress disorder and manic depression, was unemployed, homeless, unable to care for her other children, and was unwilling or unable to comply with the department's plan. Maxson v. Stafford County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 411</cite> (Dec. 16, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence proved that the mother had not substantially remedied the situation that led to the children being placed in foster care, she was not ready to care for the children, despite the services provided, and the children had been in foster care for 17 months at the time of the final hearing and needed a stable environment; the circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's rights and finding that it was in the children's best interests to do so. Showers v. Shenandoah Valley Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 9</cite> (Jan. 20, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights because he was unable to remedy the conditions that led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement; the father's extensive criminal record, his lengthy incarceration, and his potential incarceration on pending charges, coupled with his inability to provide a specific plan for the child's care, provided sufficient evidence to conclude he was unable to provide the child with a stable home and necessary care. Flora v. Shenandoah County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Mar. 3, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Parent's residual parental rights to the child were terminated because the parent, due to the parent's intellectual and psychological limitations, was unable to provide the proper medical care for the special needs child within a reasonable amount of time despite the reasonable and appropriate efforts of a county department of human services to help the parent remedy the situation. Glover v. Louisa Cnty. Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 143</cite> (Apr. 28, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err by terminating the mother's parental rights to her child under this section where the evidence showed that the child had been in foster care for 15 months and the mother had not substantially remedied the conditions that led to the child being placed and remaining in foster care, as at the time of the hearing the mother was unemployed, her rental assistance was expiring, her lease was ending, and she had no plan for where she was going to live or how she was going to pay for it. Bangura v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 193</cite> (June 9, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper, as the finding that he was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement was supported by evidence that the father failed to provide verification of stable housing and income, and failed to participate in mental health treatment, substance abuse counseling, or parenting classes. Woodard v. Dinwiddie Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 198</cite> (June 16, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the mother participated in the services offered, she did not demonstrate an ability to safely parent the children, and the trial court could have found that she had been unwilling or unable to remedy the problems that resulted in the removal of the children, such that the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights. Harper v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., No. 2237-14-4, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 203</cite> (June 23, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights because the evidence proved that the father was unable to remedy substantially the conditions that led to the child being placed and remaining in foster care. Taylor v. Roanoke County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 266</cite> (Sept. 15, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights, based on the mother's failure to failure to find suitable housing, her mental health issues, her lack of cooperation, and her admission that after 42 months of the child being in foster care she was not in a position to take care of the child. Earls v. Va. Beach Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 40</cite> (Feb. 9, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights after finding that she was still in a drug court program that could take more than one year to complete, she could not prove she had overcome her substance abuse problems, she did not follow the advice of the substance abuse counselor, she did not have a job and was dependent on father, and she and father were having marital difficulty but stopped counseling. Spruill v. Chesapeake Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 50</cite> (Feb. 16, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights to his three minor children; the father had not made much effort to regain custody of them, the children had special needs and there was no evidence that the father was capable of meeting their needs, he had been absent from the children's lives for several years, and the children had been in foster care for approximately two years, and yet the father still was not in a position to have custody of them. Spruill v. Chesapeake Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Feb. 16, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 where consideration of the father's period of incarceration was properly considered, the county social services department was not required to offer services while he was incarcerated, the father did not appear for scheduled appointments following his release, the father's stability as to housing was in question, and the child had been in foster care multiple times. Hale v. Russell Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0510-15-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 29, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a father had taken some steps to comply with the requirements of the department of social services, he was unable to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the removal of the children and them remaining in foster care; therefore, termination of his parental rights was proper. Inter alia, the father was unable to demonstrate what he had learned in parenting classes, and he was also unable to meet the children's special needs. Cabanez v. Prince William Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0878-15-4, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 109</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 5, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         In terminating a mother's parental rights to her child, the trial court did not err in finding that the mother had not substantially remedied the conditions which led to her child being placed in, and remaining in, foster care. Lambert v. Appomattox Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1926-15-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 3, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence Harrisonburg Rockingham Social Services District offered the mother numerous services, including assisting her with temporary shelters, drug counseling, and parenting classes, but mother failed to follow through or complete services offered. Feaster v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 0140-16-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 171</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 24, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was supported by evidence that the father did not have stable housing, had a history of substance abuse, failed to complete substance abuse treatment, failed to complete parenting classes to which he had been referred, and violated his probation, leading to an order of further detention and diversion. Mongold v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 1796-15-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 173</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 24, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a parent's residual parental rights because clear and convincing evidence proved that the parent failed to make substantial progress towards elimination of the conditions which led to the child's placement in a foster family, with whom the child had bonded and was doing well with an older sibling, and that termination of the parental rights was in the child's best interests. The parent failed to secure employment or suitable housing and was to be incarcerated for years due to using and selling drugs. Redman v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1900-15-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 181</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 7, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because, although she participated in a psychological assessment, substance abuse assessment, counseling, and parenting classes, and she regularly attended visitations with her child, the trial court noted that the mother's participation had to be more than just going to the assessments, counseling, and classes, as she had to listen, understand, and show some changed behavior; although the counselor saw glimpses or moments of improvement from the mother, she also found that there was no substantial or sustained progress; and the mother did not see marijuana as a problem and, until she did, she had not substantially remedied a very important condition for termination. Ayers v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0124-16-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 200</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 19, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated the parents' rights, given that there was no improvement in the area of substance abuse by the parents, who also failed to complete counseling, and there was domestic violence that had not significantly improved. Wooddell v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., Nos. 0316-16-3,
    0338-16-3, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 262</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 11, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supported a circuit court's finding that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interest because the mother did not participate in various evaluations and meetings in a meaningful manner when one of the mother's children had an acute outbreak of genital herpes, which the mother and the father of three of the four children contracted prior to the child becoming infected. Moreover, the mother never demonstrated the ability to provide a safe environment for the children. Velazquez v. Prince Edward Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0800-16-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 289</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 1, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court also did not err in terminating the father's rights, given that during the 30 months from when the children were placed in foster care to the trial, the father was unable to remedy the conditions that led to their placement, despite efforts of various agencies, and he chose not to avail himself of their assistance. Burton v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0958-16-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 53</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 28, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's decision that termination was in the children's best interests was neither plainly wrong nor without evidence to support it because the mother was residing with the father and "engaging in" drug use with him, despite having attended various drug counseling and treatment programs; since the children were placed in the custody of the department of social services, the mother never achieved stable housing or resolved her drug problem, despite participating in substance abuse programs. Gregory v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0657-16-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 100</cite> (Apr. 11, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's decision to terminate the father's parental rights was supported by evidence that the father stopped participating in therapy, refused to admit he harmed his third child, and the children were in a stable, relative placement that wished to adopt the children. Houston v. City of Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1532-16-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 166</cite> (July 11, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's decision to terminate the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that the mother stopped participating in therapy, the mother posed an ongoing risk to the children, and the children were in a stable, relative placement that wished to adopt the children. Houston v. City of Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1532-16-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 165</cite> (July 11, 2017).
        </p>

         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights because it was in the child's best interests to do so where the mother admittedly did not complete any of the required services or remedied any of the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care, the mother continued to have substance abuse problems and did not seek substance abuse treatment or obtain individual counseling, did not complete parenting classes, did not have stable employment or housing, and did not see the child, who had been in foster care for approximately 15 months, in almost one year. Custis v. Harrisonburg-Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 0229-17-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 197</cite> (Aug. 8, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights was appropriate because a circuit court did not err by determining that a municipal department of social services offered reasonable and appropriate services to a parent, specifically designed to address the parent's mental health and parenting needs, to remedy the conditions that led to the placement of the parent's child in foster care, but the parent was unable to remedy the conditions.

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's decision terminating the mother's parental rights was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, as the evidence showed that the mother lacked stable employment and housing, finding only seasonal employment being unemployed at the time of the trial, grew increasingly uncooperative, refused drug tests, and ignored attempts by the Virginia Beach Department of Human Services to reach her to provide services. Gay v. Va. Beach Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0887-17-1, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 254</cite> (Oct. 10, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her children and concluded that adoption was in their best interests because, even if a caseworker's opinion was improperly admitted, it was cumulative and clearly harmless, the circuit court appropriately weighed the credibility of the conflicting expert witnesses at issue, and concluded that one was more credible than the other, and, although the mother obtained employment, adequate housing, and consistently took her psychiatric medication, her failure to participate in therapy posed a risk to the children, and due to their special needs, she could not safely or independently parent them in the foreseeable future.

        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights to the mother's children because the circuit court found that a county department of human services made reasonable and appropriate efforts to provide the mother with services, but the mother refused to participate in the necessary substance abuse treatment. Furthermore, the court found that it was not in the children's best interests to return home because, at the time of the hearing, mother was not in a position to care for the children. Jones v. Arlington Cty. Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0569-17-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 315</cite> (Dec. 12, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the mother attended 13 of 18 parenting classes, found employment, and completed some court-ordered services, termination of the mother's rights was proper, as the mother failed to substantially remedy the conditions that existed when the child was placed in foster care, as she did not graduate from the parenting class because she did not meet the 80% attendance bench mark, she lived with a domestic abuser, and she had not prepared to care for the child. Rios v. Fairfax Cty. Dep't of Family Servs., No. 0385-16-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 326</cite> (Dec. 19, 2017).

        <p>
         At the time of the circuit court hearing, the two youngest children had been in foster care for approximately 30 months, while the mother was not in a position to have the children live with her. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court found that a mother had not complied with a social services department's very reasonable requirements, and that the mother was unable to remedy the conditions that led to her children being placed, and remaining, in foster care. Based on the totality of the record, the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence was sufficient to terminate the mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 and that termination was in her children's best interests. Reed v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1514-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Apr. 17, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supported termination of a father's parental rights because (1) the father was currently incarcerated, (2) by the time the father was released the child would have spent one-third of the child's life in foster care, (3) the father's post-release plan was not reasonable, and (4) restrictions on the father's ability to address the child's needs were of the father's own making, due to the father's criminal conviction and probation violation. Davis v. Charlotte Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1777-17-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 167</cite> (June 26, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because the mother did not adequately address problems leading to the children's removal, as (1) the mother's housing was unstable, (2) the mother stopped going to counseling after being hospitalized for depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, and (3) the mother tested positive for drugs, so, despite improvements, the mother was not in a position to care for the children, two of whom had special needs requiring therapy. Watkins v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0020-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 168</cite> (June 26, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights, as the evidence showed that the mother's cognitive abilities affected her ability to parent and live independently and the Social Services District offered reasonable and appropriate services based on what testing the mother completed. Daywalt v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 0399-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 187</cite> (July 10, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because a county department of social services made reasonable efforts to assist the father, the father was incarcerated and had a history of criminal behavior, and it was in the best interests of the child to terminate the father's parental rights. Whiting v. Gloucester Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0401-18-1, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 195</cite> (July 17, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was no error to terminate a father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 because (1) during the almost two years between original and final termination hearings, the father did not correct the conditions leading to the child's removal, (2) the father's housing and income were not stable, (3) the father was incarcerated for months while the child was in foster care, and, (4) once the father was released, the father did not complete reunification requirements, including parenting classes. Branch v. Richmond City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0211-18-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 202</cite> (July 24, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 where he had not completed a court-ordered home study, did not participate in counseling, failed to attend most of the scheduled visitations, and the child, who had been in foster care for more than two years, was doing better and was in a possible adoptive placement. Jones v. City of Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0334-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (July 24, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that the children had been physically abused, neither the mother nor the father could provide an explanation for the non-accidental injuries, and the mother would not divulge the name of the family member she believed responsible, evidencing her inability to remedy the conditions at issue. Thrasher v. Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1323-17-1, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 221</cite> (Aug. 14, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her children because at the time of the circuit court hearing, the children had been in foster care for approximately 16 months, the mother had not substantially remedied the conditions that led to their continued placement in foster care, and, although she was in remission and counseling, the mother had a high lifetime probability of a moderate to severe substance use disorder. King v. King George Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0179-18-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 220</cite> (Aug. 14, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding that the father did not substantially remedy the conditions that led to the children's foster care placement because he moved to New York City and did not participate in counseling or parenting classes and made it so the Department of Social Services could not verify his employment and housing status. Beim v. Roanoke Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0506-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 248</cite> (Sept. 25, 2018).

        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283; the social services department made reasonable and appropriate efforts to assist the mother in remedying the conditions that led to the children's continued placement in foster care, yet the mother chose not to take full advantage of the services provided, and the children had been in foster care for 17 months and had special needs, and the mother had not substantially complied with the department's requirements. Dawson v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0510-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 263</cite> (Oct. 9, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's argument that she had substantially complied with the imposed requirements was rejected where she acknowledged that she had not met several of the requirements, at the time of the ore tenus hearing she was not in compliance with some of the requirement with which she may have previously been in compliance, and she could not pick and choose previous points of time in which to comply. Horton v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0275-18-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 336</cite> (Dec. 4, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights pursuant to subsection C of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 where the conditions that led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement included a number of circumstances put in place, at least in part, by the mother, including her drug use, her incarceration, and her failure to provide adequate housing and care for the child. Horton v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0275-18-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 336</cite> (Dec. 4, 2018).

         Decision to terminate a father's residual parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was affirmed where he failed to comply with virtually any of the foster care plan requirements, such as maintaining stable, independent housing, having verified employment, completing substance abuse treatment, staying in contact with the county department of social services, and visiting the child. Lancaster v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 338</cite> (Dec. 4, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the totality of the circumstances, a circuit court did not err in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the termination of a mother's parental rights to a child because, at the time of the circuit court hearing, the child had been in foster care for approximately 23 months, and, despite the efforts of the county department of social services during that extended period, the mother had failed to remedy the mother's substance abuse issues, and the mother's relationship with the child had caused the child significant mental anguish. Ross v. Fairfax Cty. Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 8</cite> (Jan. 8, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err by terminating the mother's parental rights to her five children because her uncertain housing and unstable employment over a prolonged period made it unlikely that she would be able to provide the necessary stability and structure for the children, all of whom had special needs. The mother's inability to comply with her medications caused concern over whether she could manage the children's medication. Randolph v. Roanoke Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 30</cite> (Feb. 12, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights and foster care goal of adoption was appropriate as the mother did not follow up on programs and services, which a social services agency offered, the mother had not remedied the problems that led to the children's placement in foster care, the mother did not demonstrate the skills necessary to care for the special needs children and was not in a position to be a mother to the children, and the children's needs were being met and they were thriving after being in foster care for approximately 16 months. Herrera v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0617-19-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 213</cite> (Oct. 1, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because the father failed to participate in required services despite ample opportunities, the father's move to Delaware did not create an excusable delay for the failure to complete services, the father did not maintain continuous contact with a social services agency and never provided the agency with documentation to visit with the child, and the father did not remedy the conditions that led to the child's continued foster care placement. Harris v. Danville Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0534-19-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 233</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 22, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 because despite numerous services over an extended period, the mother had not made any progress in her ability to manage her life or care for the children; the mother had a long history of mental health and emotional issues, and she admitted that she was not in a position to have all five children come home. Lynn v. Campbell Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0958-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 1</cite> (Jan. 7, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights because, while the evidence supported the court's finding that a county department of social services had provided reasonable services to the parents, the court was concerned that the father's anger management and attachment issues had never been resolved throughout the entire process. Furthermore, the court noted that the children already had been in foster care for almost two years with services being provided. Wall v. Giles Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1072-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 20</cite> (Jan. 28, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because the child had been in foster care for approximately two years and because the father - who was incarcerated several times while the child was in foster care and had pending criminal charges, did not have stable housing until shortly before the hearing, and never provided documentary proof of being able to provide financially for the child - was not in a position to care for the child. Furthermore, the child reportedly was improving and doing well in foster care. Tyler v. Culpeper Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1840-19-4, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (May 26, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights because he failed to participate in psychological and parenting assessments, he refused to attend parenting classes, individual therapy, family counseling, and anger management classes that he had been referred to, and the child had been in foster care for approximately 16 months and the father was not cooperative. Karnes v. Campbell Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1694-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 172</cite> (June 9, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because the child had been in foster care for approximately twenty months and the mother had made almost no progress on the domestic violence and substance abuse issues that were the basis of the child's removal and placement into foster care. Furthermore, the child was doing well in a foster home, the foster family was suited to meet the child's special needs, and there were no suitable relative placements. Baldwin v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., No. 1994-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 203</cite> (July 14, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper and was in the child's best interests because, at the time of the circuit court hearing, the child was 15 years old and had been in foster care for approximately 20 months; once the mother decided to revoke the entrustment agreement and asked the Department of Social Services to provide her with services, the Department informed her that she needed to participate in a psychological evaluation, but the mother refused to cooperate, which prevented the circuit court from being able to determine whether the mother could care for the child; and the circuit court found that the child needed some consistency and a chance to have some normalcy. Roebuck v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0667-20-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 274</cite> (Nov. 4, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate because the father's children had been in foster care for over a year, the local department of social services had been unable to verify that the father had completed the required services after the children entered foster care, and the circuit court concluded from the court's observations of the father during the hearing that the father's anger issues had not been addressed. Macias v. Hopewell Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0395-20-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 267</cite> (Nov. 4, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights was appropriate because the mother's children, who were placed in foster care due to the parents' history of domestic violence and drug abuse, had been in foster care for over a year; the department of social services could not verify the mother's participation and completion of substance abuse treatment, a domestic violence program, and counseling after the children entered foster care; and the mother had not taken steps to remedy the conditions leading to the children's placement in foster care. Johnson v. Hopewell Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0567-20-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 268</cite> (Nov. 4, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err by terminating the mother's parental rights because the evidence showed that she had not been able to obtain and maintain stable housing, she had been employed in her new job for only two weeks at the time of the hearing, the child had been in and out of foster care since 2015, he had behavioral and mental health concerns that required constant supervision and structure, and the evidence showed that the mother was not ready or able to meet the child's needs. Wilson v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0475-20-1, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 276</cite> (Nov. 10, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because the Department of Social Services offered the mother numerous services, including referrals for a psychological evaluation and a parenting mentor, but mother did not complete the services; she never complied with the Department's requirement that she obtain and maintain stable housing; at the time of the circuit court hearing, the children had been in foster care for approximately three years, both children were in adoptive homes and receiving necessary services, and the mother was not in a position to resume custody of the children; and the mother was unable and lacked the capacity to remedy the conditions that led to the children's continued placement in foster care. Tinsley v. Albemarle Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0677-20-2, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 280</cite> (Nov. 17, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err by terminating the mother's parental rights to the child and finding that termination was in the child's best interest because the mother had not obtained safe and stable housing, the Norfolk Department of Human Services was unable to verify her attendance in individual counseling, the child was two years old and had been in foster care for most of his life, and the mother was not in a position to care for him. Silver v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0830-20-1, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 25</cite> (Feb. 23, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights because the Department of Human Services repeatedly reviewed with mother the services that she needed to complete before she could be reunited with her children, the mother acknowledged that she knew what was expected of her, and the mother continually refused to participate in all the services and claimed that she did not need them. Shelton v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs., No. 0990-20-1, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 14</cite> (Feb. 2, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights and approving the foster care goal of adoption because the father did not show financial stability; he admittedly engaged in panhandling for months; despite participating in a program, the father did not have a plan in place for the child; at the time of the circuit court hearing, the child had been living with the same foster family for approximately 22 months; by all accounts, the child was especially attached to his foster mother, who had been his primary caregiver since he was five days old; and, even though the Department of Human Services had offered numerous services to the father, he still was not in a position to care for the child. LaFlamme v. Va. Beach Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1155-20-1, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 59</cite> (Apr. 13, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in finding that it was in the children's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights and that the evidence was sufficient to support termination because one of the main reasons that the children entered foster care was the mother's substance abuse but she did not avail herself of the treatment services offered. Gee v. City of Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., No. 1349-20-1, 2021 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 96</cite> (June 15, 2021).

     In the absence of evidence indicating that reasonable and appropriate efforts were taken by social agencies

         - While age of the parent or parents is doubtless an appropriate consideration in assessing "good cause" in the context of subsection C of this section, it is not a circumstance which prevails over the best interests of the child. Lecky v. Reed, 20 Va. App. 306, 456 S.E.2d 538 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing in the record attributed mother's parental deficiencies to her age or suggested that the mere passage of time would resolve her difficulties; further delay would prolong child's familial instability without the promise of benefit to him, a result clearly contrary to the child's best interests. Under such circumstances, mother's age did not alone constitute good cause to excuse her failure to resolve the conditions which prompted child's foster care in accordance with statute. Lecky v.

         Termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because the mother was unable to remedy the conditions that led to the children being placed in foster care as the mother's significant cognitive limitations and lack of insight into how to provide for the children's needs could not be remediated through parent training, in-home services, or medication.

         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights because the record supported the trial court's findings that the Department of Social Services offered reasonable services, that the mother failed to timely remedy the conditions that led to the removal of the child, that clear and convincing evidence proved the mother's parental rights had to be terminated pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, and that the termination of her parental rights was in the child's best interests; the mother suffered from abnormal personality traits that would not change over time, she exhibited poor parenting skills during supervised visitations, she was dismissed from psychological treatment for noncompliance and poor behavior, and she failed to maintain steady employment.

         Evidence was sufficient to support the court's orders terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, as the record established that 1) she would place the children in the care of their great-grandmother without providing food, diapers, or other necessities for them; 2) after she disabled a smoke detector in her residence, it was destroyed by a fire believed to have been caused by her negligent disposal of a cigarette; 3) despite extensive services offered by the department of human services, she appeared unable to cope with basic parenting responsibilities.

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of

         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because the mother did not substantially remedy major issues contributing to the mother's children's removal, mainly the mother's mental health, housing, and employment issues, within a reasonable time, despite an agency's remedial efforts, when the mother refused recommended mental health services, was uncooperative with parenting education services, struggled in supervised visitation with the children, and acted inappropriately with professionals providing services to the children, and it was not in the children's best interests to wait to find out if the mother would be able to resume the mother's responsibilities.

         After considering a mother's recent attempts to obtain housing and employment, a trial court did not err in finding that termination of the mother's parental rights on grounds of failing to remedy conditions was in the best interests of three children because the children had been in foster care for four years, the mother engaged in criminal activity and used drugs during that time, and the mother made inappropriate comments to the children during visitations.

         Trial court did not err in terminating mother's parental rights because the mother did not substantially remedy the situation that led to the children being placed in and continuing in foster care. The mother did not take English classes and refused to separate from her live-in boyfriend who would not cooperate, could not be investigated, and the children feared, and none of the housing was found to be suitable.

        <p>
         Although a parent had made some progress, termination of parental rights was warranted since the parent's child had been in foster care for approximately sixteen months and was doing well, and the parent did not have housing or stable employment, still needed to address mental health issues, and had pending criminal charges.

         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights to her three children because she failed to substantially remedy her situation within 12 months of the children being placed in foster care where she failed to complete her substance abuse counseling - a key component of the foster care plan - never completed her treatment program, did not obtain stable housing, and had not contacted the Department of Social Services since March 2013.

        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to support the termination of the mother's parental rights because it showed that she was unable to remedy the conditions that prompted her children's removal during the 36 months they were in foster care, as the mother had significant cognitive difficulties from her extensive drug abuse, she had no understanding of her children's medical disabilities, she missed their medical appointments and school, she was unable to ensure that food and diapers were available, she ceased substance abuse counseling, and she had no residence of her own.

         Trial court did not err in terminating parental rights for failure to remedy the conditions that led to the foster care placement. The mother had not recognized the children's problems, including their hygiene issues and their need for medical and dental care, and she had not been able to meet their needs despite the fact that social services had been involved with the family since 2011. Henley v. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2014 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 325</cite> (Sept. 23, 2014).

        <p>
         Father did not substantially remedy the conditions that led to or required continuation of foster care for the child, given in part that he failed to cooperate with the social services department and follow through with recommended services, and he displayed a near total lack of interest in the means of improvement available to him; the evidence showed the father was unable to meet the child's needs before he entered foster care, and the father did not improve his situation while the child was in foster care, and thus the circuit court did not err in terminating the father's parental rights. Jones v. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Feb. 10, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a parent's residual parental rights was appropriate because there was clear and convincing evidence that the conditions that led to foster placement could not be substantially remedied to allow for the children's return to the parent, despite the parent's efforts to complete services, and that the parent had been unable or unwilling to substantially remedy the conditions within a reasonable period of time. Moreover, all of the children were thriving in foster care. Carlos v. City of Virginia Beach Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 65</cite> (Mar. 3, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because he had not substantially remedied the situation that led to the child being placed and remaining in foster care as he did not provide proof of his housing and payment of utilities; he was not on the lease where he lived; he relied on others to assist him with his finances; and the child had been in foster care for approximately 21 months.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 and in approving the goals of adoption because although the mother met some of the goals of the Department of Social Services, she did not substantially remedy the situation that led to the children being placed, and remaining, in foster care. Davis v. Isle of Wight Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 239</cite> (Aug. 4, 2015).

        <p>
         There was clear evidence that the mother was unable or unwilling to remedy the conditions that led to the child's removal during the 30 months he remained in foster care, as the mother did not secure stable housing and she continued to reject the services offered to her to address her mental health issues. Aijaz v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 2247-14-4, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 275</cite> (Sept. 29, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by clear and convincing evidence that the mother failed to remedy the conditions leading to the child's removal, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of rehabilitative agencies, as the mother refused to recognize the need for intense substance abuse therapy or address mental health issues, and termination was in the best interest of the child, who bonded with her foster parents and had no relationship with the mother. Grindle v. Va. Beach Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 3</cite> (Jan. 12, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding that it was in a child's best interests to terminate a parent's parental rights because the parent had not addressed the parent's own mental health issues, despite the services provided by a county department of social services and, at the time of the trial, the parent was not in a position to address the child's needs. Moreover, the trial court did not err in approving the goal of adoption because there were no relatives available for placement. Williams v. Prince George Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 1582-15-2,
    1752-15-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 135</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 26, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights on the ground that she had not maintained a relationship with the child or remedied the conditions that led to foster care placement because it relied on appropriate factors and pointed to some evidence supporting its decision that the mother failed to stabilize her mental health condition or living arrangements to the point it would not be in the children's best interests to return home. Stanley v. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 1189-16-3, 1449-16-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 92</cite> (Mar. 28, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because the evidence proved that she did not remedy her mental health and substance abuse issues, which were the conditions that had led to the children's placement in foster care, as she did not attend counseling sessions to address her mental health issues as recommended by her counselor, and told her social worker that she did not need therapy, despite evidence to the contrary; the mother did not address her long-standing substance abuse issues; and the Alexandria Department of Community and Human Services provided the mother with numerous services to remedy the conditions that led to the children's placement in foster care, but she did not fully participate in those services. Richards v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., No. 1702-16-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 188</cite> (Aug. 1, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because she moved out of state and acknowledged that the consequences included her leaving her employment and her residence, complicating her ability to regain custody of her children, and a significant reduction in her visits; she was homeless, or, at best, living with a man whose name she did not know, and for a period she could not project; and she failed to keep the Department of Social Services adequately informed of her whereabouts, did not obtain adequate psychiatric treatment or psychological counseling, did not complete a parenting program, remained unemployed throughout the majority of the time the case was pending, and was sporadic in her visitation. Cogar v. Shenandoah Valley Dep't, No. 0673-17-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 334</cite> (Dec. 27, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's residual parental rights to the mother's minor child was appropriate because the mother failed to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the child's placement in foster care for 23 months despite the reasonable efforts of a county department of family services to help the mother. Witnesses for the department testified as to the mother's lack of suitable housing, failure to deal with the mother's own mental health problems, and failure to address the medical and mental health needs of the mother's children. McKinney v. Fairfax Cty. Dep't of Family Servs., No. 0897-17-4, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 20</cite> (Jan. 30, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's rights was proper, as the child had been in foster care for approximately 21 months and was doing well, the mother failed to confirm she would attend visits with the child after missing several visits, resulting in several future visits being cancelled, and she did show she had resolved any of the issues that led to the child being placed in foster care and remaining there. Smith v. Winchester Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1310-17-4, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 23</cite> (Feb. 6, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a father's residual parental rights under subdivision C 2 was not a miscarriage of justice because the father failed to remedy the conditions that led to the child's continued placement in foster care within a reasonable time despite the services offered to him by county department of social services, and termination was in the child's best interests; therefore, the court of appeals declined to apply the ends of justice exception to address the merits of the father's arguments. Moore v. Dickenson Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1167-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 62</cite> (Mar. 13, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the testimony provided by a police officer describing a father's arrest, the admission of a body camera video of the arrest into evidence would have constituted, at most, harmless error because the officer testified at the termination hearing about the events that occurred prior to and during the father's arrest. Moore v. Dickenson Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1167-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 62</cite> (Mar. 13, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err by admitting into evidence a body camera video of a father's arrest because the video was highly relevant in the termination proceedings; the video documented the father's criminal conduct and general instability, conditions which at least partially led to the continuation of the child's placement in foster care; the events depicted in the video took place in the home where the father intended for the child to live and reflected his ability to safely parent the child. Moore v. Dickenson Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1167-17-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 62</cite> (Mar. 13, 2018).

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to subdivision C 2 and approving the goal of adoption because the children had been in foster care for almost two years, and the mother was not able to take care of them since she remained incarcerated; the children had special needs that demanded significant time and attention, and they needed consistency and stability, which the mother was unable to provide. Groffel v. New Kent Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1427-17-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Mar. 20, 2018).

Groffel v. New Kent Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 68</cite> (Mar. 20, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of whether the September 7, 2017, evaluation was admitted, there was sufficient evidence to support the decision to terminate the mother's parental rights as she had not complied with the requests of the Alexandria Department of Community and Human Services in obtaining mental health counseling and substance abuse treatment because, in May 2017, the mother attended the first two appointments for substance abuse treatment, but did not appear for any additional appointments, the therapist testified that two visits were not enough time to provide substance abuse treatment, and the mother tested positive for PCP in June 2017; and she lacked the ability to provide basic care, such as taking the children to medical appointments. Simms v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., No. 1852-17-4, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 111</cite> (Apr. 24, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights because the evidence was insufficient to establish that she failed to remedy the condition leading to the son's placement in foster care notwithstanding the services provided by the county department of social services; even if the court of appeals assumed the evidence was sufficient to terminate parental rights based on the department's "parenting skills" theory, the evidence was contested and in conflict. Sternberg v. Spotsylvania Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1506-17-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 131</cite> (May 8, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a father's parental rights because the child had special needs, the father acknowledged that he had not been involved in the child's life for a number of years and was not aware of the trauma that he had experienced, the father admitted that he did not comply with all of the Department's requests, and by not doing so, the father had not substantially remedied the conditions that required the continuation of foster care for the child and was not in a position to care for the child at the time of the circuit court hearings. McGriff v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0872-18-3, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 346</cite> (Dec. 11, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated because the father did not substantially remedy the conditions leading to the child's foster care placement after having at least 12 months to address the problem, as the father (1) did not obtain housing and still lived at the father's mother's house, who had been found not to be a suitable placement for the child, (2) became employed only four months before the hearing despite being told over a year earlier to get a job, and (3) did not participate in domestic violence counseling or parenting classes. Bentley v. City of Roanoke Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 48</cite> (Mar. 5, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because, (1) despite the Department of Family Services' reasonable and appropriate services, the mother was unable to apply what the mother learned or control the mother's mental illness, as the mother could not identify the illness or recognize the importance of medication, and (2) the mother's failings with three children were adequate to find, after one month, an inability to care for a fourth child. De Cordon v. Fairfax Cty. Dep't of Family Servs., No. 1536-18-4, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 83</cite> (Apr. 9, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights because the mother did not complete required services and, accordingly, did not substantially remedy the conditions that led to the children's placement in foster care; the county department of social services arranged for her to visit weekly with her children, but she missed several visitations, and the department referred the mother to a parenting class, which the mother did not complete. Rasheed v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1569-18-3, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 88</cite> (Apr. 16, 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because the condition of the home when the child was removed was horrible; the circuit court found the County Department of Social Services' witnesses to be credible and was persuaded by the multiple witnesses, who testified that the parents had made minimal progress in remedying the conditions which led to the removal of the child; at the time of the hearing, the child had been in foster care for approximately 18 months, and the parents admitted that they were not in a position to have all five children, the parents' child and the mother's other four children, come home; and the parents had never progressed to the point of having unsupervised or overnight visitations with the child. Lynn v. Campbell Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0954-19-3, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 4</cite> (Jan. 7, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights because the city department of social services presented evidence that it had provided the father with numerous services for years, yet he was unable to improve his parenting skills; throughout the department's involvement with the family, several professionals had expressed concern about the father's ability to parent the children safely, and the father was unable to demonstrate that he could care for the children.

     §
    
    16.1-283 was not supported by the record because there was no evidence that anyone from appellee Department of Social Services confronted the mother and told the mother what the child accused the mother of doing, nor did the record show the mother was offered any rehabilitative services.

         Insufficient evidence was presented to terminate parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because after the mother had to be hospitalized following a psychotic breakdown, leading to the child's removal from the home, the mother began taking anti-psychosis medication, and the father became educated about the mother's condition, so he knew what to do in case of another breakdown.

         Father was not required to overcompensate for the mother's parental deficiencies, and the decision to terminate his rights should have been an independent evaluation; he had completed services, speculation that he might not be able to provide for the child was premature, and while the circuit court appropriately expressed concern about his stability and delayed involvement, alone those concerns were insufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that his rights were to be terminated for failure to remedy conditions.

    - Termination of parental rights for failure to remedy conditions amounts to a last resort to protect children when all other reasonable remedies have been attempted and failed and requires that the department of human services establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination of a parent's rights is the only reasonable and appropriate recourse; it does not require a parent to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he should retain his fundamental liberty interest in the custody of his child.

         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because the father's parental rights previously were terminated to four of his children; the father had received numerous services since the Department of Social Services first became involved with his family in 2005; despite all of the services provided over the years, the father continued to have problems with the same issues, namely substance abuse and domestic violence; and it was in the child's best interests that the father's parental rights be terminated.

Furthermore, the father was convicted of felony child abuse with respect to two of the father's other children and the father's child at issue suffered broken ribs without any accidental explanation of the injury.

         Trial court did not err in terminating the mother's rights to her three children, as, despite the services offered to the mother, she as unable to meet the needs of the children and substantially remedy the situation that led to the children being placed in and remain in foster care. While the mother emphasized that she separated from father, who was abusive, addressed her substance abuse issues, and participated in counseling and parenting classes, the mother lacked any plan for housing or child care.

         It was in a child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights because the mother's parental rights previously were terminated to other children and the child was doing well in foster care with a family that was adopting a sibling. Despite the services which an agency provided to the mother while the child was in foster care, the mother continued to have mental health issues, chronic substance abuse issues, homelessness, instability in housing, lack of employment, and financial instability.

         Trial court did not err by granting the Department of Social Services' petition for termination of the mother's parental rights, as the mother's parental rights to two other child were previously terminated and the trial court's order found termination in the child's best interests.

         Termination of the mother's parental rights was proper because the Department of Social Services presented evidence that the mother's parental rights to her three older children had been terminated on July 28, 2016, and that she had a history of mental illness and refused to take her medication; this statute did not require the Department to offer services to the mother, but, nevertheless, the circuit court found that after the child's birth, the Department went to the mother and tried to get her to cooperate and had a safety plan, but the mother refused to cooperate; and the child's best interest was to remain in the care of the paternal grandmother as the child was doing well there.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights to a child because the child was doing well in foster care with the mother's older child who also had been removed and had become attached to the foster parents. Furthermore, termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child given the mother's mental health issues and lack of progress in parenting skills training. Pilenza v. Nelson Cty.

    - Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to subsections B and C of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, because termination was in the child's best interest where the mother was unwilling or unable to remedy the problems that caused the child to be removed, namely, to take required medications and avoid relapses, and where the mother had never met or visited the child, the mother had no permanent employment, the grandmother handled the mother's finances, the mother resided in an efficiency apartment, which was too small, and the mother was expecting another child.

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subsection B and subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, was supported by evidence that, despite parenting and anger management classes, the father yelled and cursed at the children during visitation, showed no physical affection toward the children, refused to change the youngest children's diapers, and did not follow Department of Social Services' recommendations.

         Sufficient evidence supported the termination of a mother's parental rights, pursuant to subsections B and C
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, as in the best interests of her thirteen-year-old child because the mother: (1) physically and mentally abused the child; (2) was psychiatrically and cognitively limited; (3) did not complete a psychological evaluation or participate in counseling; (4) did not complete substance abuse assessment and cooperated with only one out of three drug screens; and (5) did not maintain stable housing.

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to terminate a father's parental rights pursuant to subsections C and E of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because at the time of the termination hearing, the trial court did not know when the father would be released from jail; according to the foster care plan, the father's eventual release date remained uncertain more than a year after the child was taken into the custody of the county department of family services, and the father's long incarceration prevented him from caring for his son.

         Termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights under subsections B and C of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the Department of Social Services offered services to both parents, including parenting classes, visitation, housing assistance, and counseling, but they were unable or unwilling to comply with the Department's efforts and two years was more than a reasonable period of time to remedy the conditions leading to foster care.

     §
    
    16.1-283 because the father was unable to complete in a timely manner the requirements of the Department of Social Services to go to parenting classes, maintain stable housing, and stay in contact with the department; during the time the children were in foster care, the father had at least three addresses, he failed to stay in contact with the department, and he visited the children one time while they were in foster care despite offers from the epartment to transport him to visitations.

         Trial court did not err by terminating a mother's parental rights on different grounds than did the juvenile and domestic relations district court, from which the mother appealed to the circuit court; by citing
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 generally, the petitions provided the mother with notice that the mother's parental rights could be terminated under any subsection of that provision, and the circuit court was in no way limited in its options by any actions of the juvenile and domestic relations district court.

        <p>
         Because a father had little capability of making concrete plans for the future and was not able to correct or eliminate the neglect problems that led to foster care placement, it was in the children's best interests to terminate his residual parental rights under subsection B and subdivision C 2 of

        <p>
         Terminating a mother's parental rights and changing the foster care plan goal to adoption were in her child's best interests because, while she participated in a psychological evaluation, she did not complete the other offered services, missed and/or refused to participate in numerous scheduled drug screenings, the child's life, health, or development was threatened, and it was not likely that the conditions could be substantially corrected or eliminated within a reasonable period of time.

        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err by terminating a parent's residual parental rights to a child because the evidence supported the court's factual findings that the parent, despite parenting classes and substance abuse counseling, could not substantially correct or eliminate the conditions that resulted in neglect or abuse and that the parent was unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time to substantially remedy the conditions, which required continued foster care of the child.

        <p>
         Trial court did not err when it terminated the mother's parental rights because the county department of social services removed the child from the home because of substance abuse issues; drugs were found in the mother's home; the mother had pending drug charges; the trial court found that the mother had not substantially remedied her substance abuse problems; there was no evidence that the mother completed the services offered by the department, including parenting classes, parenting coach, and the domestic violence alternatives program; and the child was doing well in his foster care home, which was an adoptive placement, and deserved permanency.

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights pursuant to two subsections, given that the mother demonstrated an inability to care for the child, the child had been in foster care for approximately 22 months, the mother did not have suitable housing, she stopped therapy and her medications and was dating a sex offender, and she had not substantially remedied the conditions that led to the child being in and remaining in foster care.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights pursuant to subsection B and subdivision C 2 because the mother had a reasonable period of time to substantially correct the conditions that resulted in her children being placed in foster care, and she did not substantially remedy the problems even though by the time of the hearing, one of her children had been in foster care for more than eighteen months.

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that, after being involved in a service plan because of drug and alcohol use, the mother attempted suicide in the children's presence, the mother was unable to maintain stable housing or employment, the mother struggled with serious mental health issues, and the children had been in foster care for over 21 months. McKiver v. Portsmouth Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 392</cite> (Dec. 22, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights and approval of foster care plans with the goal of adoption were in the best interest of a parent's children because, despite all of the services provided by a social services department toward the goal of returning the children home from foster care, the parent was not able to provide and care for the children and eliminate the conditions that led to the neglect or abuse. Moreover, the children had been in foster care for more than twelve months and were benefitting from the care that they received. Bellflower v. Hopewell Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1464-15-2, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 15, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's residual parental rights to her son was proper because, although the mother argued that the evidence was insufficient to support termination under one subsection of this statute, she did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support termination under another subsection of this statute; and the mother's failure to challenge the circuit court's termination decision under one subsection rendered moot her claim regarding the termination under the other subsection of this statute as termination of her rights would have occurred in any event under the unchallenged subsection. Brown v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 21, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because a parent failed even to challenge the termination of the parent's parental rights for failure to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement, this failure rendered moot the parent's claim challenging the termination of parental rights on grounds of neglect or abuse. Therefore, the appellate court did not need to reach that claim as the parent's parental rights were terminated in any event. Pagans v. Franklin Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 21, 2017).

        <p>
         Circuit court properly terminated a mother's parental rights, found that the termination was in the child's best interests, and approved the goal of returning the child to the father because the department of community and human services provided her with reasonable services, there was no evidence that she had remedied the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement, the child had not bonded with the mother, but was very attached to father, and it was uncertain whether the mother would be capable of developing the tools and resources and education to be a good, caring and loving parent to the child.

    - In a termination of parental rights case against a mother, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 barred the mother from raising on appeal sufficiency of evidence and due process claims that she had not raised at trial. As she had not asked that the court invoke the exceptions for good cause or to meet the ends of justice, the court would not consider such arguments sua sponte. Young v.

         In a case in which a mother appealed the trial court's termination of her parental rights to her four children, arguing that the trial court erred because it was the children's father who was convicted of felony child neglect and he was the individual accused of molesting two of her children, pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18, the appellate court was barred from hearing that claim since there was no evidence in the statement of facts that the mother presented that argument to the trial court. Strother v.

         Mother failed to specify a basis for her challenge to the trial court's decision to terminate her parental rights because the agreed statement of facts the parties submitted pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct.

         Because a mother made no progress towards the goals set out for her to be reunited with her daughter, other than completing a psychological evaluation; she had no contact with her for almost two years; she completely failed to avail herself to the assistance provided to her; and the child had been thriving in foster care during this time, clear and convincing evidence showed that termination of the mother's residual parental rights was in the child's best interest.

         Termination of father's parental rights was in his child's best interests under circumstances in which the child had lived with his mother until the mother was no longer able to care for him, during this time, the father's whereabouts were unknown, about a month after the child went into foster care, the father requested custody of the child, but the father's extensive criminal history included "barrier crimes" that prevented placement of the child in the father's care, after the child went to live with his mother, the father arrived for a visit under the influence of drugs and offered drugs to the mother, and, thereafter, the father had no contact with his child or with the department. The father testified that his "plan" for his child was that "hopefully" one of his sisters-in-law would care for his child while he furthered his recovery; it was not in the best interests of a child to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his responsibilities.

         Evidence that it was in the child's best interest to remain with the child's foster parents, that the Department of Social Services had made "reasonable and appropriate" efforts to communicate with the father and strengthen the father's relationship with the child, and that the father failed to maintain communication with the child and plan for the child's future supported the termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 1 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. It was in the child's best interest to remain with the child's foster parents because the child considers them the child's natural parents, the child's sister lived there, the foster parents wished to adopt both children, the developmentally disabled child had made significant progress with the foster parents, and the child would likely regress if removed from the foster parents' home.

         In a case in which a father argued that the trial court did not find that he was an unfit parent and that, in the absence of that finding, the law presumed the best interest of the child would be served when in the custody of the natural parent, since the trial court found that the factors listed in
    
     §

         Trial court's best interest determination was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, as a rational fact finder could have determined that cognitively impaired parent with anger management issues and a heightened propensity for violence was unfit to address the unique special needs of three children with whom he had relatively little interaction over the past four years, and thus, the termination of the father's parental rights was proper.

         As the circuit court did not foreclose the possibility that a father would ever again be awarded visitation with his child, its order of no visitation unless certain conditions were met did not constitute a de facto termination of the father's parental rights; the circuit court explicitly provided the father with a path for reunification with the child, and because the circuit court properly utilized the best-interests standard, it did not violate the father's constitutional rights.

         Department of Social Services demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it was in child's best interest for parental rights to be terminated where mother's lifestyle and parental skills posed a serious and substantial threat to the health and development of her daughter, and precipitated the physical abuse of her daughter, and moreover mother's behavior during the time she regained custody of her daughter demonstrated that she was unable or unwilling to remedy the conditions which had caused her daughter's placement in foster care, and with respect to father, evidence established that the father had, without good cause, failed to remedy the conditions which led to foster care placement of his daughter and that he failed to provide for his daughter prior to his being incarcerated, and also failed to respond to rehabilitative efforts available to him. Bell v. Warren County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 2319-92-4 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 3, 1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence proved that defendant neglected his daughters and permitted them to be abused, that he suffered from a mental illness that constituted prima facie evidence of his neglect and abuse, that such neglect and abuse presented a serious and substantial threat to the girls' health and development, that defendant was unwilling to cooperate with the Department of Social Services for over 12 months to try to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the placement of the girls in foster care, and that it was in the best interest of the children not to be returned to defendant's care and custody; therefore, the trial court did not err in terminating defendant's parental rights to his daughters, pursuant to subsections B and C of this section. Hileman v. Winchester Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0320-93-4 (Ct. of Appeals, May 3, 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where mother received extensive services from Department of Social Services (DSS) and other agencies since 1977 but despite these services, her other four children suffered from severe neglect and abuse, including multiple instances of failure to thrive, and her parental rights to each were terminated and because of this history of abuse, her daughter was placed in the custody of DSS immediately after her birth and had never lived with the mother; the evidence indicated that mother was able to care for her own daily needs but that she was functioning at the highest level in which she could be expected to reach and she would never be capable of either caring for daughter independently or responding to her needs in an age-appropriate manner; moreover, daughter was attached to her foster parents, and removal from that home would cause her permanent harm; the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights. Jenkins v. Winchester Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1001-93-4 (Ct. of Appeals, May 17, 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where mother's parenting and housekeeping skills remained poor, despite the years of extensive services and assistance mother received through the Department of Social Services and the evidence demonstrated that mother's interactions with her children were mercurial and inconsistent and continued to exacerbate their emotional problems, the record contained sufficient credible evidence in support of the decision of the trial court terminating mother's parental rights. Durham v. Alexandria Dep't of Social Servs., No. 2176-93-4 (Ct. of Appeals June 7, 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where evidence proved that in the child's first six months of life, appellant visited her less than once a month, each time for an hour or less and was intoxicated on at least one of those occasions; more than 18 months passed before appellant saw his daughter again; he made no attempt to contact the Department of Social Services worker to arrange more frequent meetings; prior to his incarceration in 1992, appellant had no permanent address and failed to support the child; at the hearing, he indicated that he expected to be paroled sometime in 1995, but had made no plans to provide a home or care for the child upon his release; and the record also indicated that although the child has serious heart problems, appellant failed to complete necessary cardio-pulmonary resuscitation training, the Department established a prima facie case under this section for the termination of appellant's parental rights. Medley v. Giles County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 2170-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals May 31, 1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where parent habitually abused intoxicating liquors to the extent that proper parental ability was seriously impaired and she, without good cause, had not responded to or followed through with recommended and available treatment which could have improved the capacity for adequate parental functioning, and where she had not responded to or followed through on appropriate rehabilitative efforts and services offered through Department of Social Services (DSS) or other agencies is prima facie evidence that the abusive or neglectful conditions have not been corrected, then her parental rights were properly terminated. Babb v. Scott County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1585-95-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 23, 1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that it was in the best interests of the child to terminate the mother's parental rights where the mother had been unwilling or unable, without good cause and for a period exceeding 12 months, to remedy the conditions which led to the child's foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of the social services district, and where the mother, without good cause, failed to make reasonable progress towards the elimination of the conditions which led to the child's foster care placement in accordance with a jointly-designed foster care plan, and where the mother was unwilling or unable to stay out of a relationship which was demonstrably abusive to herself and her children.

        <p>
         A mother's parental rights were properly terminated on the basis that she had been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period not to exceed 12 months to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child's foster care placement, despite reasonable and appropriate efforts from the Division of Social Services, where (1) she failed to recognize, acknowledge, or accept any responsibility for her children's neglect or to see any need for improving her parenting or relational skills, and (2) although the mother testified that she addressed the problem of the father's alcoholism by separating from him, the evidence indicated that she continued to have an ongoing relationship with him.

        </p>
        <p>

Eaton v. Department of Social Servs., No. 0868-99-3 (Ct. of Appeals July 20, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of father's parental rights was in child's best interests, where evidence established that father never complied with requirements of foster care plan and refused any assistance offered by Department of Social Services. Terry v. Franklin County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1527-99-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 5, 1999).

        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights was appropriate where trial court could reasonably find that conditions that led to mother's abuse of daughter were not going to change in near future, despite assistance and services provided to mother. Harvey v. Lynchburg Div. of Social Servs., No. 2691-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 5, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supported termination of mother's parental rights for failure to maintain contact with her child in foster care, failure to remedy problems leading to foster care placement, and likelihood that conditions which caused neglect could not be substantially corrected in a reasonable period of time. Malave v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 2708-98-4 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 19, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights was justified, as trial court was not required to place more credibility in her proposed plans for future than warranted by her actions in past, and other evidence demonstrated that increased contact with mother, without an improvement in her parenting and anger management skills, would not be in children's best interests. Bivins v. New Kent County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0304-99-2 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 2, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that she failed to implement recommended changes in her behavior or to contact available services, and that abusive home environment, which was underlying cause of children's placement in foster care, remained unchanged. Knight v. Bedford County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1841-99-3 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 23, 1999).

        <p>
         Department of Social Services proved by clear and convincing evidence that it was not reasonably likely that conditions which resulted in children's physical and sexual abuse were substantially corrected or eliminated, so as to allow their safe return to mother's custody.

        </p>
        <p>
         Father's prospective plans were unclear and his past history unpersuasive that he would make the necessary changes in his life to provide for his daughter if she were returned to him, and department of family services presented clear and convincing evidence that termination of father's parental rights was in the best interests of the child. Foreman v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., No. 1432-99-4 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 14, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of father's parental rights was in child's best interests, where social service agency's attempts to render stabilization services to assist him in remedying conditions which led to his daughter's foster care placement were thwarted by his constant moving, his relocation to Pennsylvania, and his unwillingness and inability to seek help with his mental health problems. Jackson v. Richmond Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0648-99-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 28, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights was in child's best interests, where her mental health problems contributed to her inability to successfully parent her daughter, and it was unlikely that mother's problems would abate in future given her inability to maintain a treatment program. Jackson v. Richmond Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0226-99-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 28, 1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         The record supported the trial court's determination that a father's parental rights should be terminated where the father failed to meet his obligations under the foster care plans, failed to complete the necessary parenting class or alcohol treatment program and failed to seek alternative treatment until after his parental rights were terminated in the juvenile and domestic relations district court and where the testimony in the mother's parental rights termination trial, transcripts of which were introduced into evidence, documented incidents of the father's drinking and abusive behavior.

        </p>
        <p>
         A father's parental rights were properly terminated where the record clearly demonstrated that the three children had special needs because of their history of abuse and required a greater amount of supervision; and that the father had failed to comply with the terms of the foster care plan related to the improvement of his parenting skills; that the parents were unable to provide both the necessary support and structured environment their children needed and that the parents had failed to address the issues that led to the removal of their children. Baker v. Fredericksburg Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1089-99-2, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 203</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 21, 2000).

        <p>
         A father's parental rights were properly terminated where the trial court had found by very clear and convincing evidence that the children had been neglected or abused; that this neglect and abuse was a serious threat to their lives, health, or development, and that the father, without good cause, did not respond to or follow through with appropriate, available, and reasonable rehabilitative efforts, and that he, without good cause, was unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time to remedy substantially the conditions that led to the children's placement in foster care and had failed, without good cause, to communicate with the children for a period of twelve months. Stergiou v. Frederick County Dep't of Social Servs., No. 0156-99-4, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 202</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 21, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the mother took no affirmative steps until one year after the children's placement in foster care and where the evidence showed that despite DSS's assistance, the mother failed to participate in individual counseling, refused to follow through with recommendations made by professionals working with her, and failed to secure stable employment or safe housing for herself let alone her children, the record supported the trial court's finding that the mother failed to remedy within one year of the children's placement in foster care the conditions that led to that placement. Dimauro v. Virginia Beach Dep't of Social Servs., No. 1533-99-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 267</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 11, 2000).

         A mother's parental rights had been properly terminated where the evidence presented to the trial court supported its findings that between 1989 and 1995 the department of social services and at least eighteen agencies provided rehabilitative services to the family in an effort to remedy the children's neglect and to assist the mother in developing good parenting skills, that despite the numerous services provided, the mother was unable or unwilling to provide the extensive care and supervision required by the children, that the mother functioned at a limited intellectual level and failed to comprehend the depth of the children's needs and that, in light of the mother's limitations as well as the children's extraordinarily high needs, there was no reasonable expectation that the mother could provide the care needed by the children.

        <p>
         It is irrelevant to the trial court's determination under subdivision C 2 that there was no evidence that defendant abused the children prior to their placement in foster care. Instead, where the Department of Social Services proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of defendant's parental rights was in the best interests of the children and that he failed, without good cause, to make substantial progress towards the elimination of the conditions which led to the children's foster care placement in accordance with his obligations under and within the time limits set out in the foster care plan, the court upheld termination of his parental rights.

         Department of Social Services (DSS), established a prima facie case under this section as to all four of father's children when it proved that he was convicted of the malicious wounding of one of them; while DSS did not present evidence relating to the other three children during the hearing, relevant information concerning each of them was set out in other parts of the record and the trial court's finding by clear and convincing evidence that the termination of parental rights was in the best interest of each of the four children was supported by evidence in the record.

         A mother's rights were properly terminated where the record demonstrated that the department of social services provided services to assist the mother and her husband beginning in 1992, that despite these services, the mother failed to make substantial progress towards improving her parenting skills, establishing a stable home life, or becoming financially self-sufficient, that her employment was sporadic, in part due to periods of incarceration, that she briefly participated in individual counseling with some regularity until January 1995, that she refused to attend parenting classes, that when the mother visited with the children, the visits were often marked by little or negative interaction, that, with some regularity, the mother failed to appear for scheduled visitation or reduced the time allotted for visitation by arriving late or leaving early and that she failed to respond to the attempts of one child's therapist to contact her.

         A father's parental rights were properly terminated where the evidence established that his son was born prematurely, that both the child and the mother tested positive for cocaine, that the child remained in the hospital for 42 days and the father visited only 4 times and telephoned 11 times, that the father never responded to letters sent by a social worker or exercised visitation rights during the time the department of social services had custody of the child, that the father would not be released from incarceration for selling cocaine for three years and that a change in placement would disrupt the child's primary attachment relationship with his foster family and could result in traumatization with long term psychological consequences.

         A mother's residual parental rights were properly terminated where the department of social services had provided reasonable and appropriate social, medical, mental health and other rehabilitative services to the mother but she chose not to take advantage of them. May v. Virginia Beach Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0461-00-1, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 847</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 28, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that mother failed to provide adequate shelter for two minor chidren, refused to cooperate with Social Services' attempts to develop a treatment plan, would not get the younger child immunized, and would likely not be able to improve her parenting skills, was sufficient to support trial court's ruling terminating mother's residual parental rights in the children. Perkins v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs., No. 1080-01-3, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 514</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 18, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's failure over a five year period to avail herself of social services offered in an attempt to reunite the mother with her two minor children justified termination of the mother's parental rights in the children. Rayeford v. City of Portsmouth Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1662-01-1, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 523</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 25, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under subdivision C 2 of this section, a trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights where she had been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year from the date her child was placed in foster care, to substantially remedy the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child's foster care placement. DeJesus v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1061-01-2, 2001 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 529</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 25, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under subdivision C 2 of this section, the trial court properly terminated father's parental rights where the father had been unwilling within a reasonable period of time, well over 12 months from the date his children were placed in foster care, to substantially remedy the conditions which led to the children's foster care placement. Wilson v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1514-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 11</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 8, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence showed that mother had failed to maintain contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of her two children for six months or more; as a result, the trial court did not err in terminating her parental rights in the two children. Jones v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1543-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 12</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 8, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating mother's parental rights after hearing evidence that she moved numerous times while her two children were in foster care, used drugs, did not complete a court-ordered anger management program, did not provide for her children, and did not substantially plan for their futures, as the evidence showed she was unable to substantially remedy the conditions that led to the children's initial placement in foster care. Jones v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1543-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 12</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 8, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating mother's residual parental rights where she was a drug user, there was a record of violence in the home and mother's contact with child had stopped. Ingram v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1890-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 15</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 8, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred in denying Division of Social Services' petition to terminate the mother's parental rights to her minor son, as the record did not support the finding that the mother made substantial efforts to remedy the conditions leading to foster care of the son where the mother failed to complete mental health and substance abuse counseling, to obtain adequate housing or stable employment, or to cooperate in other rehabilitative efforts by social, medical or other agencies to reduce or eliminate the neglect or abuse of the son. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Fenimore, No. 0704-02-3, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 579</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 1, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining a change in a foster care plan to adoption was in a child's best interests where clear and convincing evidence showed that the mother failed to remedy the conditions leading to the child's foster care placement, despite offered assistance by the social services department. Fitzgerald v. Montgomery County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0475-02-3, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 442</cite> (Ct. of Appeals July 30, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's parental rights were properly terminated where: (1) children had been in foster care almost three years; (2) during part of that time, the mother had been imprisoned for child neglect and assault of one child; (3) the mother failed to participate in most of the recommended parenting programs; (4) the mother was at risk for abusing the children; and (5) the mother made no progress toward meeting the children's significant emotional or psychological needs. Wilson v. James City County Div. of Soc. Servs., No. 0362-02-1, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 546</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 10, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's parental rights were terminated where: (1) the mother refused almost all of the services offered by the Department of Social Services; (2) the mother failed to obtain safe housing and regular employment; (3) the mother failed to complete counseling and therapy; and (4) the mother failed to regularly visit her daughter. Harper v. Va. Beach Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1385-02-1, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 547</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 10, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated where: (1) the children had been in foster care almost three years, and the father was imprisoned for 17 months of that time; (2) the father did not have consistent housing; (3) the father did not complete the recommended parenting programs; (4) the father admitted that he was not in a position to care for the children; and (5) the father was unable to remedy within a reasonable time the conditions that led to his children's placement in foster care. Wilson v. James City County Div. of Soc. Servs., No. 0270-02-1, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 548</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 10, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court did not err in finding that mother did not remedy the conditions leading to her child's placement in a foster home where she continued to use drugs, did not complete parenting classes, did not properly house her children, and allowed another child, an infant, to die of hypothermia. Simpson v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0109-02-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 329</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 4, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Decision terminating parental rights was affirmed where father's failure to visit regularly with his daughter, his failure to comply with testing or attend counseling, his failure to plan for her future, and his lengthy incarceration underscored his admitted abandonment of his daughter. Lushbaugh v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0174-02-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 340</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 11, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where evidence showed that a mother was offered the services necessary to help her remedy the conditions that resulted in the placement and continuation of her children in foster care and that she failed, without good cause, to substantially remedy the conditions which caused that continuation, the termination of mother's parental rights would be upheld. Terry v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 3322-01-2, 2002 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 356</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 18, 2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was in his children's best interest as the father, despite the fact that a social services agency made reasonable and appropriate efforts to help the father remedy the conditions which led to or required the continuation of the children's foster care placement, without good cause, failed to substantially remedy those conditions. Van Buren v. City of Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 2618-02-2 through 2621-02-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 250</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 29, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a mother, without good cause, failed to respond to extensive rehabilitative efforts, the Department of Social Services properly determined adoption and parental rights termination was proper after the mother had a reasonable time to correct problems. Chandler v. Staunton-Augusta County Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 2853-02-3 through 2856-02-3, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 295</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 13, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clear and convincing evidence proved both that the government agency made reasonable and appropriate efforts to help the mother remedy the conditions which led to or required continuation of the foster care placement of her children and that the mother without good cause failed to substantially remedy those conditions within a reasonable period of time; accordingly, the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights in her daughters. Atkins v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 3398-02-2, 3399-02-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 314</cite> (Ct. of Appeals May 27, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was affirmed where the mother had been offered an array of services and advise to remedy the conditions which led to the placement of her children, including, inter alia, parent/child nurturing classes, substance abuse evaluations, counseling, and in-home assistance services, but failed remedy the situation. Stanley v. Amherst County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0039-03-3, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 320</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 3, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         After the subject children were found neglected or abused and placed in foster care due to abuse, as shown by various bruising, and neglect, as shown by severe developmental delays, and their mother refused to acknowledge that she had in any way contributed to the children's placement, and refused to cooperate with a variety of efforts to rehabilitate her parenting style, there was clear and convincing evidence that (1) the children were judicially found to be neglected or abused and placed in foster care pursuant to a court commitment; (2) the department of social services had, before the children's placement, tried to rehabilitate the mother; (3) termination of parental rights was in the children's best interests; (4) their neglect or abuse presented a serious threat to their life, health or development; and (5) it was not reasonably likely that the conditions causing the neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow a safe return to their mother within a reasonable time, as the mother, without good cause, did not respond to or follow through with available rehabilitative efforts designed to reduce, eliminate or prevent neglect or abuse of the children, constituting prima facie evidence of the conditions for termination of parental rights in subdivision B 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Hansberry v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 0117-03-2 - 0120-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 336</cite> (Ct. of Appeals June 17, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Department of Social Services presented clear and convincing evidence satisfying the statutory requirements of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 and established that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests because (1) the Department made reasonable and appropriate efforts to help the mother remedy the conditions that both led to and required continuation of the children's foster care placement, (2) the mother failed to make reasonable progress toward eliminating the conditions which led to the placement because (a) by her own admission, the mother continued to use drugs for two years after three of her children were removed from her care, (b) the mother participated in at least five substance abuse programs, (c) the mother marginally completed one program and was discharged from several others for non-compliance, and (d) the mother failed to maintain steady employment or obtain stable and adequate housing for the children, (3) the three older children had been in foster care for over two and one-half years, were doing well there, and were placed together with one family who was interested in adopting them, and (4) the youngest child had been in foster care for one and one-half years, since he was four months old, and his foster family was interested in adopting him. Gibson v. Newport News Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0378-03-1, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 434</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 12, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's finding, that the neglect and abuse suffered by the daughter as a result of the mother's care was not reasonably likely to be substantially corrected so as to allow the daughter's safe return to the mother, was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Harvey v. City of Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0637-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 448</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 26, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the child as required by subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 because the homeless and unemployed mother had not enrolled in parenting classes and had not sought substance abuse and mental health evaluations. Baker v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0598-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 459</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 2, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the decision of the trial court to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of appellant mother was supported by clear and convincing evidence after it was shown that her parental rights as to three of her other children had been involuntarily terminated, the decision of the trial court was affirmed and the court did not have to address the mother's argument that termination was not in her daughter's best interests because the department of social services had not offered the mother any services and had not presented any evidence that she failed to remedy the conditions that required the daughter's placement in foster care. Jenkins v. City of Newport News Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0428-03-1, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 460</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 2, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that mother failed to take medication prescribed for her bipolar disorder, did not comply with conditions imposed as part of foster care plans, did not attend court-ordered anger management classes, and was arrested for assault on four occasions while her children were in foster care was sufficient to support trial court's judgment terminating her parental rights. Sanchez v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 1125-03-2, 1677-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 489</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 30, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where there was extensive testimonial evidence demonstrating the severity of mother's mental illness and that the illness prevented her from caring for her child, the trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights pursuant to subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Singleton v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0809-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 536</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 28, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a father pleaded guilty to felony child abuse of his son and did not preserve an argument under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 that the abuse resulted in "serious bodily injury," termination of his parental rights under clause (iii) of subsection E of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the best interest of his daughter. Charlton v. Tazewell County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2448-03-3, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 680</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 23, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was approved as the department of social services presented clear and convincing evidence establishing that the termination of the mother's parental rights was in her child's best interests because of the mother's inability to maintain adequate housing and to provide a safe environment for the child over a two-year period. B. W. v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1659-03-2, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 698</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 30, 2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that the children were removed from the home and placed in foster care as a result of abuse and neglect, the children had been in a stable foster home for almost two years, the children adjusted well to the environment and were doing well in school, and the Department of Social Services offered the father approximately 22 months of appropriate and reasonable services which he failed to take full advantage of was sufficient to support termination of the father's residual parental rights. Rollins v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., No. 1426-03-4, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 37</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 28, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was upheld after the evidence showed that the Spotsylvania Department of Social Services made numerous attempt to communicate with the father and got not indication of the father's desire to accept and complete the services offered until the hearing; in addition, the evidence showed that the father failed to maintain continuing contact with the children and did little to remedy the situation despite being advised of the necessary steps. Voage v. Spotsylvania Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 1984-03-2, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 3, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a father failed to meet a reunification plan's goals, the Virginia Department of Social Services satisfied the requirements of subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 and established that termination of the father's parental rights was in the child's best interest. Perry v. Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2165-03-1, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 17, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a mother did not complete all of the ordered services, did not stabilize her living environment and mental health issues, had previously had her rights to another child terminated, and did not preserve a placement options claim under Rule 5A:18, the mother's parental rights were properly terminated. Brown v. City of Norfolk, Nos. 2529-03-1, 2530-03-1, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 189</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 2, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that the requirements of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 had been met, and that the termination of the mother's parental rights to her daughter was in the child's best interests where: (1) the mother had a severe mental illness, had been hospitalized repeatedly, and refused to cooperate in her treatment, (2) the mother refused to admit that her daughter was sexually abused by her son, although he admitted the charge, and often left her daughter with her son, (3) the child suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome due to her mother's treatment of her, (4) the daughter was physically and emotionally neglected and abandoned by the mother, and (5) the mother refused to cooperate with the efforts of the department of social services to assist her. Abt-Barnett v. Chesterfield-Colonial Heights Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2949-03-2, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 196</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 27, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         The trial court's order terminating the mother's parental rights stated that the trial court, based upon clear and convincing evidence, found it was in the child's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights. Thus, the trial court made the necessary findings to support termination. Corprew v. Norfolk Soc. Servs., No. 0375-04-1, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 416</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 7, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a mother's parental rights was proper where the daughter was the victim of a pattern of ongoing trauma that resulted in psychological damage and adverse physical effects, including post-traumatic stress disorder, developmental delays, hair loss, and respiratory problems; the daughter's response to the stress was severe dissociation, which created a strong possibility that she would develop a personality disorder or a borderline personality disorder. Davis v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0875-04-3, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 442</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 14, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Order terminating a father's parental rights was upheld, as sufficient evidence supported the trial court's finding that such was in the best interest of his children, given his severe alcohol problem, his refusal to enter into a residential treatment program, and lack of desire to remedy the conditions that led his children to be placed in foster care. Harris v. Campbell County Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0741-04-3, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 478</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 5, 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the Department of Social Services presented clear and convincing evidence satisfying the statutory requirements and establishing that termination of a mother's parental rights was in the children's best interests, due to the overwhelming record including examples of the mother's uncooperative, hostile, and unwilling attitude toward compliance and rehabilitation, evidence that she failed to remedy conditions. Copley v. Newport News Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2490-04-1, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 22, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's residual parental rights was in the child's best interest where the evidence showed that the father had been incarcerated for all but the first two weeks of the child's life, that during those two weeks, the father did not demonstrate an ability to parent the child, and there was no proof that the father would be released or able to resume care of the child in the near future. In addition, the child had become integrated into her foster family, which was interested in adopting her. Burns v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 2523-04-2, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 8, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of father's parental rights was affirmed where the evidence showed that the father failed to maintain contact with the child or provide for his future, failed to demonstrate a willingness or ability to alter the circumstances that necessitated the child's continued foster placement, was unable or unwilling, within the 30 months since the child was placed in foster care, to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of foster care placement, and notwithstanding the Department's investigation into a placement with relatives showed that the relatives either would not accept responsibility for the child or could not provide a suitable home environment. Quesenberry v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 149</cite> (Apr. 12, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         County family welfare agency proved by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of the father's residual parental rights was in the best interests of the child, that reasonable and appropriate services had been offered to him, and that he had not remedied the conditions within a reasonable amount of time; accordingly, the trial court's judgment terminating the father's residual parental rights was affirmed. Boyd v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 178</cite> (May 3, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         While the record showed that termination of the mother's parental might be warranted based on the best interests of the minor child, the appellate court did not need to consider whether the other requirement for proving termination pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was met, that the mother failed to timely remedy the conditions that led to the minor child's placement in foster care; instead, termination of her parental rights was proper pursuant to subdivision E 1 of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    16.1-283 because she did not challenge the trial court's finding, supported by the evidence, that termination was in the minor child's best interests and that the mother's parental rights in another son were terminated when that other son was six years old. Fields v. Dinwiddie County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 46 Va. App. 1, 614 S.E.2d 656, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 236</cite> (2005).

         Trial court did not err in entering a judgment that terminated the biological father's rights in the son, especially since clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that termination was in the best interests of the child; the evidence showed that the father had long-standing mental health and substance abuse problems and that the child was thriving in his foster care family. Hayes v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 431</cite> (Nov. 1, 2005).

         Because a mother did not obtain suitable housing or complete the required therapies that were provided by the Department of Social Services, the trial court properly terminated her parental rights to her children. Johnson v. County of Chesterfield Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 520</cite> (Dec. 20, 2005).

        <p>
         Appellate court was not required to address the mother's argument that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights under subsection C 2, since the termination of her parental rights under subsection E was amply supported by the record; the appellate court did not need to decide whether termination would also be proper under the alternative section since only one ground for termination was required. Canter v. City of Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs., No. 0507-05-3, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 501</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 13, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of residual parental rights to son was affirmed, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that changes in foster care plans were in the best interests of two other children; both parents moved frequently, were often unemployed, and failed to remedy their situation and the son was doing well in foster care. Northover v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 499</cite> (Dec. 13, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to two of her three children where the mother had not found stable housing and had not maintained stable employment, and she refused to prohibit the children's stepfather, who had sexually abused the mother's oldest child, from having any contact with the children. Arrington v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 28</cite> (Jan. 24, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the underlying factual basis for the mother's conviction for child abuse clearly constituted "aggravated circumstances" and there was voluminous evidence, including numerous lay and expert witnesses, termination of her parental rights was in the best interests of the children. Wimmer v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 18</cite> (Jan. 17, 2006).

         Where parents' rights to their son and the mother's rights to her daughter were terminated under
    
     §
    
    16.1-283(B), 16.1-283(C)(1) and (2), and 16.1-283(E)(i) but the parents only challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the termination under

    <span class="s1">
     §

    16.1-283(B), (C), and (E) each provided for distinct, individual bases for termination of residual parental rights. Scott v. Charlotte County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 101</cite> (Mar. 21, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Order terminating a mother's parental rights was supported by sufficient evidence which showed, inter alia, that the mother had obtained neither stable housing nor adequate employment in the nearly two years since the child entered foster care, that, while the child was in her care, the mother had exposed him to domestic abuse, yet since the child entered foster care, she had not completed parenting classes, attended a domestic violence program, or taken any tangible step that suggested that she would not expose the child to such future risk, that the mother had participated in therapy inconsistently, and that her depression remained unresolved; the evidence also showed that the child, on the other hand, was thriving under the care of his foster parents, even moving toward recovery from the lingering effects of his time spent in the mother's care, and the child's therapist testified that visitation with the mother was not in the child's best interest. Lutes v. Va. Beach Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 120</cite> (Mar. 28, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a district court did not base the termination of a father's parental rights on his convictions for sexual abuse against his daughter since the father had not yet been convicted, the proceeding before the circuit court on appeal was de novo, and the circuit court properly based its termination decision on the fact that the father had been convicted since the time of district court's decision; thus, termination of the father's parental rights was proper. Hargrove v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 106</cite> (Mar. 21, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was supported by evidence that no family members were willing to care for the child or were suitable custodians for the child. The trial court's finding that the grandmother was not a suitable custodian was supported by evidence that the grandmother suffered from a variety of psychological problems, including bipolar disorder, and was not forthcoming with the mental health care provider who examined the grandmother about prior involvement with social services. Tarantini v. Rockbridge County Dep't,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 179</cite> (May 9, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because a child remained in foster care in excess of two years because the mother failed to cooperate with the Department of Family Services, failed to cooperate with the initial attempts to perform home studies, and refused to provide a plan for the child's care upon relocating to Texas, where she was unemployed and ultimately incarcerated, all while the child thrived in foster care, clear and convincing evidence supported a finding terminating her residual parental rights; hence, the trial court's order was summarily affirmed under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:27. Watt v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 224</cite> (May 23, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of appellants' parental rights was upheld where there was sufficient evidence that the neglect and abuse suffered by the child presented a serious and substantial threat to the child's life, health, or development; among other things, the physical structure of the family home was compromised and neither parent was committed as the primary caretaker for the child. St. Peter v. Isle of Wight County,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 277</cite> (June 27, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         An evaluator's conclusion that the mother lacked the ability to parent her child without assistance was borne out by her own behavior, including exposing the child to a family known to be abusive to children, admittedly breaking a car window in a fit of anger as she held the child in her arms, and leaving the child unattended on a second floor balcony. Given the opportunity to have unsupervised visitation with her child, the mother sexually abused the child. Greenway v. Craig County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 258</cite> (June 13, 2006).

        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights to her two sons, where a social services agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the children's best interest. Both boys were exposed to improper sexual behavior and domestic violence. Jeen Calloway v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 318</cite> (July 18, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated a father's residual parental rights to his two minor children; the record supported the trial court's finding that the children's best interests would be served by terminating the father's parental rights and that the father had failed to maintain continuing contact with the children and to substantially plan for their future, notwithstanding the efforts of a social services agency. Williams v. Chesapeake Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 305</cite> (July 11, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of mother's parental rights was upheld where, inter alia, the mother admitted to continued drug use, including the usage of drugs and alcohol while pregnant, the mother had been incarcerated due to her own conduct, and it was not reasonably likely that the mother would substantially correct or eliminate the conditions that led to the children's placement in foster care. Butler v. Culpeper County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 48 Va. App. 537, 633 S.E.2d 196 (2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Record showed by clear and convincing evidence that a mother's parental rights should be terminated pursuant to
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, and that the termination of her parental rights was in her child's best interest. The mother testified that even after almost two years she was not ready or able to care for her child, and although she was offered services and assistance, she failed to make any progress in finding stable employment or housing and failed to substantially plan for her child's future. Lassiter v. Children's Home Soc'y of Va.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 447</cite> (Oct. 10, 2006).

        <p>
         Trial court's termination of a mother's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in a child's best interests; the record showed that the child, born prematurely, failed to thrive under her mother's care but gained weight and developed properly after being placed in foster care, and there was no evidence that the mother would be able to resolve her medical and emotional issues sufficiently that she could once again care for the child. Green v. Greene County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 451</cite> (Oct. 10, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that a mother's children had been in foster care for 18 months; that because of the abuse and neglect they suffered while living with their parents, they needed long-term, specialized treatment; that returning them to their parents would be detrimental to their health and safety; and that the conditions resulting in such neglect or abuse were unlikely to be eliminated within a reasonable period of time, was sufficient to support the court's decision to terminate the mother's parental rights. Oliver v. Roanoke City Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 446</cite> (Oct. 10, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 based on an expert's opinion that he would have difficulty safeguarding a child, as well as clear and convincing evidence that he scored in the high risk range on a measure of child abuse, failed to attend appointments with counselors and a psychologist, and was provided adequate services by the division of social services based on his needs. Abbitt v. Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs.,, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 484</cite> (Oct. 31, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights was upheld, as the evidence proved that the father subjected the children to repeated physical abuse, from which the mother failed to protect them, the children repeatedly witnessed physical confrontations between the mother and the father, and the mother's reunification plan included active participation of the father, whose parental rights had also been terminated. Rothgeb v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 23</cite> (Jan. 23, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's judgment terminating the parental rights of the mother was affirmed on appeal, as the city social services department presented clear and convincing evidence that the parental rights should be terminated and that termination was in the best interests of the child; the record showed that the mother had no contact with the child since the child was born, and that the mother's schizophrenia was a progressive disease that could not be cured and was likely to worsen over time, which made it all but impossible for the mother to raise and care for the child. Snead v. City of Hampton Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 12</cite> (Jan. 16, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's denial of a mother's motion to vacate an order terminating her residual parental rights was proper because, inter alia, although the mother argued that she had signed the order "under duress," she was unable to specify how she had been under duress, and, although the mother claimed there were family members who could care for her son, she was unable to give the trial court any names; it was noteworthy that the mother never suggested that vacating the order would have been in her son's best interests and never disputed the trial court's reliance on subdivision C 2 and subsection E of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 as the bases for the termination. The mother acknowledged that she had asked her attorney to withdraw her motion to vacate the day before the hearing was held on the motion. Wilson v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 116</cite> (Mar. 27, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of parental rights under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was upheld where the evidence showed that additional time would not make either parent able to properly care for the child; the mother had a long history of drug abuse and failure to complete substance abuse programs and the father was mentally deficient and completed few of the services offered to the father. Battle v. City of Portsmouth Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 221</cite> (May 29, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that the father had been unwilling or unable to provide for any of the child's needs, the father had failed to remain in contact with the child while incarcerated, the father did not have a job or appropriate housing to care for the child, the child and the child's half-brother had been thriving in a foster home where their needs were being met on a consistent basis, and that removal from the foster family and separation from the brother could prove traumatic to the child and contrary to the child's best interests was sufficient to support termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2. Jones v. City of Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 254</cite> (July 17, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Department of Social Services proved by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the mother's parental rights under subsections B and C of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was in the child's best interests, providing evidence that the mother denied using cocaine although the mother and the baby tested positive; the mother made no progress, despite the numerous services the Department offered, due to the mother's refusal to cooperate and untruthfulness; the mother made no plans for the child's future; the mother remained unemployed and planned to obtain housing only if and when the mother's grandmother evicted the mother; and the mother demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to change the circumstances that necessitated the child's placement in foster care within a reasonable amount of time. Saunders v. Charlotte County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 309</cite> (Aug. 21, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that a parent's parental rights should be terminated pursuant to subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Expert testimony was presented that the parent was unable to care for the child and that the child's behavior improved when visitation with the parent was discontinued. Spain v. Roanoke County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Feb. 12, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother's residual parental rights were properly terminated as to a six-year-old son because: (1) the mother would never be able to successfully parent the child according to a psychological evaluation; and (2) the mother was unable to remedy the condition leading to the removal and foster care of the child despite the Department of Social Services' offers of reasonable and appropriate services since the mother refused services and nothing was likely to enable the mother to remedy the reason the children were placed in foster care. Bailey v. Halifax Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 119</cite> (Mar. 11, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrary to a mother's contention, a trial court did not err in terminating the mother's parental rights to a child, even though it did not terminate the father's parental rights, simply because the mother and father intended to continue living together as a couple. Subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 allowed for the termination of only one parent's rights and doing so did not violate any public policy. Campbell County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Roberts,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 225</cite> (May 6, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrary to a trial court's ruling, evidence that the trailer in which a father was living was unsafe for a child, that two other adults living in the trailer were prone to violence, and that the father had failed to avail himself of services that had been offered to assist him in regaining custody of his child, established a prima facie case for termination of his parental rights under subdivisions B 1 and B 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. Campbell County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Roberts,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 225</cite> (May 6, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Decision terminating a parent's residual parental rights to three minor children pursuant to subdivisions C 1 and C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was appropriate, considering the parent's lack of continuing contact with the children. The parent's only contact with them between October 2006 and August 2007 consisted of, at most, a birthday card or a total of four letters. Jackson v. Lancaster County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 198</cite> (Apr. 22, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights under subsection B of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was proper as the evidence clearly and convincingly proved that the mother was suffering from a mental or emotional illness or mental deficiency of such severity that there was no reasonable expectation that the mother would be able to undertake responsibility for the care of the child in accordance with the child's age and stage of development. Parks v. Wythe County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 405</cite> (Aug. 26, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a parent's parental rights,
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 C 2, was proper as the child had been in foster care all of the child's life, approximately fifteen months. Upon the parent's release from jail, the parent had no plans to secure housing and a job, and was not prepared to begin parenting the child. Welch v. Newport News Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 397</cite> (Aug. 19, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to warrant termination of a parent's residual parental rights under both subdivision C 1 and C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283. The parent's explanation for the parent's failure to stay in touch with the parent's child was that the parent was "on the run" and wanted to use drugs, and the child's behavior had improved during placement with a foster family. Foster v. Madison County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 398</cite> (Aug. 9, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because a father failed to challenge the termination of his parental rights under subsection B and subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283, and because nothing in the record or the written statement of facts filed in lieu of a transcript indicated that the father alleged a violation of his due process rights before the trial court, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 barred consideration of his claims on appeal. Carr v. Pulaski County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 337</cite> (July 22, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the father failed to complete the recommended treatment and counseling programs to help the father address poor self-management and parenting issues, failed to maintain steady employment, and had no suitable place for the children to live. Austin v. Newport News Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 441</cite> (Sept. 30, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of a parent's parental rights was proper. Due to the parent's illegal drug use and failure to comply with services offered to the parent, the parent's children had been in the parent's care for only a couple of months between May 2006 and the time of a circuit court hearing in April 2008, a period of almost two years. Graves v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 476</cite> (Oct. 21, 2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to terminate the mother's rights under
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 B, C 1 and 2, where the mother had lived in two condemned houses with the children, the mother had pled guilty to eight child abuse and neglect charges, and the children had been in foster care for almost two years, during which time the mother had been unable to meet the requirements for reunification. Mecimore v. Alexandria Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 41</cite> (Feb. 3, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's residual parental rights under
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that, during the first year of the child's removal, the mother failed to complete parenting classes, obtain substance abuse treatment, maintain safe and stable housing, or obtain employment, and the child's foster family wanted to adopt the child and consistently provided for the child's behavioral and emotional needs. Martin v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 126</cite> (Mar. 24, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Judgment terminating a parent's parental rights to the parent's children was proper, as the children had special needs that required special attention, and the parents had financial problems that twice led to the termination of electricity and water. Their house was unsafe, dirty, and in total disrepair. Wright v. Lynchburg Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 89</cite> (Mar. 10, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental rights to the mother's infant child was supported by evidence that the infant was born prematurely, while the mother was incarcerated, and tested positive for marijuana, and that the mother refused to participate in substance abuse treatment and failed to participate in programs offered in jail. Rivera v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 101</cite> (Mar. 10, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated where the father failed to complete parenting skills classes, therapy, a psychological evaluation, and anger management classes; failed to participate in a batterers' group; failed to refrain from alcohol or illegal substance use; and failed to maintain stable housing. Such evidence supported the finding that the neglect or abuse suffered by the child presented a serious and substantial threat to the child's life, health, and development and that it was not reasonably likely that the conditions that resulted in the neglect or abuse could be substantially corrected or eliminated by the father. Newman v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 246</cite> (June 2, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Father's parental rights were properly terminated where the father had spent only three years of the father's adult life unincarcerated, the father had never held or touched the child and had only communicated with the child through a prison window, and there was no evidence that the father would ever be able to care for the child. Dameron v. Albemarle County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 247</cite> (June 2, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence that the mother was offered numerous services, including transportation to meetings and supervised visitation, but failed to make any effort to address the mother's parenting skills or employment and housing issues and the mother's failure to make any effort to learn sign language so that the mother could communicate with the child supported the trial court's termination of the mother's parental rights under subdivisions C 1 and 2 of

        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was sufficient to terminate the parental rights of a mother and father because the department of social services provided numerous services to the mother and father and required them to meet several goals, but neither the mother nor the father was able to meet the requirements, the mother and father did not have adequate and stable housing, and the father did not have stable employment and had not completed a Domestic Violence Alternatives Program; the department had concerns about both parents when they visited their children, the trial court found that the circumstances of the mother and father were not going to change in any time reasonably, the two older children had severe speech delays when they entered foster care, but they had improved, and all of the children were doing well in foster care.

    16.1-283 termination of his parental rights arguing that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights where he was exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent due to pending criminal charges related to the present proceedings, even if the trial court erroneously based its decisions to terminate the father's parental rights in part on the allegations of father's sexual abuse and his decision to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, any such error was harmless because sufficient evidence not related to the sexual abuse allegations or the criminal charges supported the trial court's decisions. In addition to the father's failure to participate in a psychosexual evaluation, he had not provided the DSS with verification of employment or housing, he had not participated in parenting classes, he had not paid child support or visited the children, and he had tested positive for drug use in the recent past.

    40.1-103 for cruelty or injury to a child was not an offense that constituted felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault within the meaning of clause (iii). He asserted unsuccessfully that he did not inflict serious bodily injury on the child, rather he was convicted for acts of omission, i.e., once having gained knowledge of sexual assault by his son against his child, he failed to prevent further abuse; that argument was rejected based on the plain language of

         In a case in which a mother appealed the termination of her parental rights, she argued unsuccessfully that the trial court erred in failing to adequately consider continued foster care as an alternative to termination and misapplied the law relating to termination, contrary to the mother's assertion, the record showed that the trial court considered continued foster care placement, but it found, based on the evidence, that the mother would not be able to remedy the conditions that endangered the children and adequately and safely care for them within a reasonable period of time.

         Termination of the father's parental rights under subdivision C 2 of
    
     §
    
    16.1-283 was supported by evidence that the father had not seen child in four years when the termination petition was filed, was often late for visits with the child, and failed to complete alcohol and drug services assessments or any treatment recommended by the licensed psychologist. Walker-Bey v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs.,, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 282</cite> (June 23, 2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper because it was not in the children's best interest to spend a lengthy period of time waiting to find out when, or even if, the father would be capable of resuming his responsibilities. The father was not in a position to care for the children and their needs; he had not met the requirements of the Norfolk Department of Human Services; and at the time of the hearing in the trial court, the children had been in foster care for approximately 19 months. Tharrington v. Norfolk Dep't of Human Servs.,, 2010 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 343</cite> (Aug. 24, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a mother made some progress, such as completion of the Drug Court program, she was unable to meet her children's needs, she did not follow up with necessary medical care for one of the children when the child had growth issues, she could not adequately supervise her children, and she did not recognize and understand the children's emotional and psychological needs, thus, the department presented sufficient evidence to support the termination of the mother's parental rights.

        <p>
         Because the circuit court relied on appropriate factors and pointed to some evidence supporting its decision to terminate the parental rights of a mother and father, the appellate court held that the circuit court's best interests' determination was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Stanley v. Bristol Dep't of Soc. Servs., Nos. 1189-16-3, 1449-16-3, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 92</cite> (Mar. 28, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's orders terminating the mother's residual parental rights to her children were neither plainly wrong nor without evidence to support them, as the evidence showed that the mother failed to demonstrate an ability to maintain a clean home, the mother waited too long to enroll in and begin a course on domestic violence, and the mother failed to begin the recommended individual counseling to address her mental health issues within 12 months.

        <p>
         In a case involving a mother and her two children, the appellate court concluded that the mother's appeal from a circuit court's decision terminating her parental rights to the first child and approving the foster care plan's goal of adoption for the second child was without merit. The county department of social services presented evidence that the mother was unable or unwilling to remedy the conditions that led to her children being placed in foster care, and furthermore the department presented evidence that the children were doing well in their placements. Robinson v. Warren Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 55</cite> (Mar. 6, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court had sufficient credible evidence to deny a mother's renewed motion to strike because a doctor's testimony and report indicated that the mother's mental health related problems and intellectual disability made it very difficult for her to meet her own needs, let alone adequately attend to her children's special needs; the testimony of a child protective services worker established that the mother had a history of physical neglect of her children.

        <p>
         Termination of the mother's parental right was upheld where the evidence showed that the Department of Social Service's actions were reasonable under the circumstances, and the mother's incarceration, since the child was three years old, limited the agency's capacity to remedy her deficiencies as a parent.

         Termination of parental rights was in the child's best interests where the father failed to make substantial progress towards ending his daughter's continuation in foster care and his incarceration did not excuse his behavior.

        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating the residual parental rights in the minor child, as clear and convincing evidence showed that termination was in the minor child's best interests; the father was using and selling drugs despite the fact that he had served sentences on drug charges several years earlier, the father was not due to be released for a few more years, the county child welfare agency had unsuccessfully offered services to him before he went to prison, and the conditions that caused the county child welfare agency to remove the minor child from him could not be remedied any time soon.

         Father's residual parental rights to his child were properly terminated because: (1) the father, without good cause, never directly or through someone on his behalf, contacted department of social services to inquire about the child, even though the department made efforts to communicate with the father and involve him in the child's life; (2) the father never provided or substantially planned for the child's future prior to the termination hearing; and (3) the father never sent letters, cards, pictures, toys, or support to the child. Additionally, the father was incarcerated and serving a 15-year sentence for child molestation and statutory rape in Georgia. Willis v. City of Portsmouth Dep't of Soc.

        <p>
         Termination of the father's parental rights was proper and in the child's best interests because he testified that he had not seen the child since approximately 2014, and he had been incarcerated the entire time that the child was in foster care; the earliest date the father would be released was in February 2019; there was no evidence that the father was able to remedy, within a reasonable period of time, the conditions that led to the child's foster care placement; although the child had improved since he entered foster care and had gone well beyond what was hoped for him, he still required a great deal of attention and care; and the child had developed a bond with his foster parents and a teenager who lived in the home.

         Circuit court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights and in finding that termination was in the children's best interests because the mother's parental rights to another child previously were involuntarily terminated and the children had been in foster care for almost two years. The mother had not progressed in the ability to parent the children despite all of the services provided to the mother and the children's behaviors and physical health improved after they stopped visiting the parents.

         Trial court erred in terminating a mother's parental rights to her child, as there was not clear and convincing proof that she did not remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child's foster care placement; she participated in psychological evaluation and individual therapy as ordered, was able to obtain suitable employment and to provide adequate furnishings for the children, and her inability to obtain family therapy was due to the failure of the Department of Social Services to make arrangements for such therapy.

         Evidence supported the trial judge's conclusion that the children's best interest required that the mother have the opportunity to realize her goal of remedying her living situation and parenting skills. Among other things, the caseworker's testimony that the mother's hospitalization precipitated the children's placement in foster care supported the trial judge's finding that the only reason they were in foster care was because the mother was in the hospital and there was no one else to take care of them; in addition the trial court found that the mother continually sought stable housing and employment, and cooperated with Department of Social Services caseworkers in those efforts.

        Petition to terminate a father's parental rights was granted because the father, without good cause, had not been willing or able to remedy the child's foster care situation within a reasonable period of time; the father reduced, of his own accord, the reasonable probability that he would complete his program within a reasonable period of time because he voluntarily made decisions and engaged in actions during his mental health treatment that resulted in him reverting to level one status.

        Termination of a father's residual parental rights was in the best interests of the child because the father did not form any substantive relationship with the child before or during his incarceration or while he underwent treatment; the child had lived with a foster parent for several years, and the foster parent appropriately addressed the child's mental health needs.

         A juvenile is not immune from incarceration in jail.
        </b>
        Rather, alternative and less harsh measures are preferred for the juvenile offender, but when the best interests of the child demand such confinement, that is available as an alternate discipline. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

         The jail sentence is merely an additional remedial alternative

        applied, if at all, to incorrigibles who have committed an offense which would be a felony or misdemeanor if they were adult. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         When jail sentence may not be imposed.
        </b>
        - Because the power of the court under this section to impose a jail sentence is limited in application to offenses committed by a juvenile which would have been either misdemeanors or felonies had they been committed by an adult, a juvenile who has been accorded juvenile delinquent status for any other reason may not be sentenced to jail. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         Finding of incorrigibility is procedural.
        </b>
        - The statutory requirement of a finding of incorrigibility is a procedural prerequisite to the exercise of the court's general remedial powers which are granted elsewhere in the statute, and not a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the court. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

       <p>
        <b>
         Effect of failure to record such finding formally.
        </b>
        - Since the failure of a circuit court to formally record a finding of incorrigibility is a State procedural error in sentencing and not a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the court, such failure is not a ground for federal habeas corpus relief. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1979).

    - Trial court properly sentenced defendant to an indeterminate commitment as a serious juvenile offender because the terms "child," "juvenile," and "minor" were interchangeable, the term "may" provided the trial court with discretion to commit a "delinquent child" to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) and, while defendant was over 18 by the time of trial, he nevertheless was subject to commitment to the DJJ because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.

        If a juvenile 14 years of age or older is found to have committed an offense which if committed by an adult would be punishable by confinement in a state or local correctional facility as defined in § 53.1-1, and the court determines (i) that the juvenile has not previously been and is not currently adjudicated delinquent of a violent juvenile felony or found guilty of a violent juvenile felony, (ii) that the juvenile has not been released from the custody of the Department within the previous 18 months, (iii) that the interests of the juvenile and the community require that the juvenile be placed under legal restraint or discipline, and (iv) that other placements authorized by this title will not serve the best interests of the juvenile, then the court may order the juvenile confined in a detention home or other secure facility for juveniles for a period not to exceed six months from the date the order is entered, for a single offense or multiple offenses. However, if the single offense or multiple offenses, which if committed by an adult would be punishable as a felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor, caused the death of any person, then the court may order the juvenile confined in a detention home or other secure facility for juveniles for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date the order is entered.

If it appears at such hearing that the purpose of the order of confinement has been achieved, the juvenile shall be released on probation for such period and under such conditions as the court may specify and remain subject to the order suspending commitment to the State Department of Juvenile Justice. If the juvenile's commitment to the Department has been suspended as provided in subsection B of this section, and if the court determines at the first or any subsequent review hearing that the juvenile is consistently failing to comply with the conditions specified by the court or the policies and program requirements of the facility, then the court shall order that the juvenile be committed to the State Department of Juvenile Justice.

     ICE detainer is merely a request.

    - It does not create for a law enforcement agency either an obligation or legal authority to maintain custody of a prisoner who is otherwise eligible for immediate release from local or state custody.

If a juvenile is being held pursuant to an indeterminate commitment, the Department of Juvenile Justice may exercise its discretion to hold the juvenile until ICE officials assume custody, provided the Department does not hold the juvenile longer than thirty-six continuous months or past his twenty-first birthday.

        In the case of a juvenile fourteen years of age or older who has been found guilty of an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and either (i) the juvenile is on parole for an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult, (ii) the juvenile was committed to the state for an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult within the immediately preceding twelve months, (iii) the felony offense is punishable by a term of confinement of greater than twenty years if the felony was committed by an adult, or (iv) the juvenile has been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense which if committed by an adult would be a felony punishable by a term of confinement of twenty years or more, and the circuit court, or the juvenile or family court, as the case may be, finds that commitment under this section is necessary to meet the rehabilitative needs of the juvenile and would serve the best interests of the community, then the court may order the juvenile committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice for placement in a juvenile correctional center for the period of time prescribed pursuant to this section.

        In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall specify a period of commitment not to exceed seven years or the juvenile's twenty-first birthday, whichever shall occur first. The court may also order a period of determinate or indeterminate parole supervision to follow the commitment but the total period of commitment and parole supervision shall not exceed seven years or the juvenile's twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs first.

        Upon receipt of a juvenile committed under the provisions of this section, the Department shall evaluate the juvenile for the purpose of considering placement of the juvenile in an appropriate juvenile correctional center for the time prescribed by the committing court. Such a placement decision shall be made based on the availability of treatment programs at the facility; the level of security at the facility; the offense for which the juvenile has been committed; and the welfare, age and gender of the juvenile.

       <li id="t16.1c11a09s16.1-285.1ol1E">
        The court which commits the juvenile to the Department under this section shall have continuing jurisdiction over the juvenile throughout his commitment. The continuing jurisdiction of the court shall not prevent the Department from removing the juvenile from a juvenile correctional center without prior court approval for the sole purposes of routine or emergency medical treatment, routine educational services, or family emergencies.

        Any juvenile committed under the provisions of this section shall not be released at a time earlier than that specified by the court in its dispositional order except as provided for in § 16.1-285.2. The Department may petition the committing court, notwithstanding the terms of any plea agreement or commitment order, for a hearing as provided for in § 16.1-285.2 for an earlier release of the juvenile when good cause exists for an earlier release. In addition, notwithstanding the terms of any plea agreement or commitment order, the Department shall petition the committing court for a determination as to the continued commitment of each juvenile sentenced under this section at least sixty days prior to the second anniversary of the juvenile's date of commitment and sixty days prior to each annual anniversary thereafter.

      <p>
       Alternatively, in order to determine if a juvenile, transferred from a juvenile and domestic relations district court to a circuit court pursuant to § 16.1-269.1, appropriately qualifies for commitment pursuant to this section, notwithstanding the inapplicability of the qualification criteria set forth in clauses (i) through (iv), the circuit court may consider the commitment criteria set forth in subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 of subsection B as well as other components of the juvenile's life history and, if upon such consideration in the opinion of the court the needs of the juvenile and the interests of the community would clearly best be served by commitment hereunder, may so commit the juvenile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such commitment order must be supported by a determination that the interests of the juvenile and community require that the juvenile be placed under legal restraint or discipline and that the juvenile is not a proper person to receive treatment or rehabilitation through other juvenile programs or facilities.

     Commitment upheld on appeal.
    </b>
    - Commitment and sentence of a juvenile as a serious offender was upheld on appeal based on his conviction of felony hit and run, reckless driving, and assault and battery because the trial court properly considered the juvenile's age and the aggressive, violent, and willful manner of the incident, along with the extensive injuries suffered by the victim, which resulted from the juvenile purposely hitting a park game warden with his ATV when the game warden was trying to stop the juvenile.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly sentenced defendant to an indeterminate commitment as a serious juvenile offender because the terms "child," "juvenile," and "minor" were interchangeable, the term "may" provided the trial court with discretion to commit a "delinquent child" to the Department of Juvenile Justice and, while defendant was over 18 by the time of trial, he nevertheless was subject to commitment to the Department because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense.

The court shall state in its order for detention the basis for all findings required by this section. In addition, any order of disposition for such violation confining the child in a secure facility for juveniles shall (a) identify the valid court order that has been violated; (b) specify the factual basis for determining that there is reasonable cause to believe that the child has violated such order; (c) state the findings of fact that support a determination that there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative available to placing the child in such a facility, with due consideration to the best interest of the child; (d) specify the length of time of such confinement, not to exceed seven days; and (e) include a plan for the child's release from such facility.

        § 16.1-293. Supervision of juvenile or person during commitment and on parole; placing juvenile in halfway house.
        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       At such time as the court commits a juvenile to the Department, the juvenile and domestic relations district court service unit shall maintain contact with the juvenile during the juvenile's commitment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is placed on parole supervision following that person's release from commitment to the Department, the court services unit providing parole supervision shall furnish the person a written statement of the conditions of his parole and shall instruct him regarding the same. The conditions of the reenrollment plan may be included in the conditions of parole. Violations of parole shall be heard by the court pursuant to § 16.1-291. If the parole supervision is for an indeterminate period of time, the director of the supervising court services unit may approve termination of parole supervision.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department shall notify the school division superintendent in the locality where the person was enrolled of his commitment to a facility. The court services unit shall, in consultation with the local school division, the Department's Division of Education and the juvenile correctional counselor, develop a reenrollment plan if the person is of compulsory school attendance age or is eligible for special education services pursuant to § 22.1-213. The reenrollment plan shall be in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Education pursuant to § 22.1-17.1. The superintendent shall provide the person's scholastic records, as defined in § 22.1-289, and the terms and conditions of any expulsion which was in effect at the time of commitment or which will be in effect upon release. A court may not order a local school board to reenroll a person who has been expelled in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 22.1-277.06. At least 14 days prior to the person's scheduled release, the Department shall notify the school division superintendent in the locality where the person will reside.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event it is determined by the juvenile and domestic relations district court that a person may benefit from placement in the halfway house program operated by the Department, the person may be referred for care and treatment to a halfway house. Persons so placed in a halfway house shall remain in parole status and cannot be transferred or otherwise placed in another institutional setting or institutional placement operated by the Department except as elsewhere provided by law for those persons who have violated their parole status.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that the person was in the custody of the local department of social services immediately prior to his commitment to the Department and has not attained the age of 18 years, the local department of social services shall resume custody upon the person's release from commitment, unless an alternative arrangement for the custody of the person has been made and communicated in writing to the Department. At least 90 days prior to the person's release from commitment on parole supervision, (i) the court services unit shall consult with the local department of social services concerning return of the person to the locality and the placement of the person and (ii) the local department of social services and the court services unit shall collaborate to develop a plan that prepares the person for successful transition from the Department's commitment to the custody of the local department of social services or to an alternative custody arrangement if applicable. The plan shall identify the services necessary for such transition and how the services are to be provided. The court services unit will be responsible for supervising the person's terms and conditions of parole.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the event that the person was in the custody of the local department of social services immediately prior to his commitment to the Department, is between 18 and 21 years of age, provides written notice of his intent to receive independent living services to the local department of social services, and enters into a written agreement with the local department of social services as set forth in § 63.2-905.1, the person shall be eligible to receive independent living services from the local department or a child-placing agency pursuant to § 63.2-905.1. At least 90 days prior to the person's release from commitment on parole supervision, (i) the court services unit shall inform the person of the availability of independent living services and shall consult with the local department of social services concerning return of the person to the locality and living arrangements for the person and (ii) the local department of social services and the court services unit shall work collaboratively to develop a plan for the successful transition of the person from the custody of the Department to independent living, which shall identify the services necessary to facilitate the person's transition to independent living and describe how the necessary services shall be provided.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In all cases in which a person who is in the custody of the local department of social services is committed to the Department, the local department of social services and the Department shall work cooperatively through the duration of the person's commitment to ensure communication of information regarding the status of the person and to facilitate transition planning for the person prior to his release.

If the alleged delinquent act is one which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, the child shall be entitled to a jury of 12 persons. In all other cases, the jury shall consist of seven persons. If the jury in such a trial finds the child guilty, disposition shall be by the judge pursuant to the provisions of § 16.1-278.8 after taking into consideration the report of any investigation made pursuant to § 16.1-237 or 16.1-273.

Upon appeal from a conviction for failure to support or from a finding of civil or criminal contempt involving a failure to support, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may require the party applying for the appeal or someone for him to give bond, with or without surety, to insure his appearance and may also require bond in an amount and with sufficient surety to secure the payment of prospective support accruing during the pendency of the appeal. An appeal will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required is filed within 30 days from the entry of the final judgment or order.

Upon receipt of the notice of appeal from the juvenile court, the circuit court shall provide a copy of the order and a copy of the notice of appeal to the attorney for the Commonwealth within seven days after receipt of notice of an appeal. The time limitations shall be tolled during any period in which the juvenile has escaped from custody. A juvenile held continuously in secure detention shall be released from confinement if there is no hearing on the merits of his case within 45 days of the filing of the appeal. The circuit court may extend the time limitations for a reasonable period of time based upon good cause shown, provided the basis for such extension is recorded in writing and filed among the papers of the proceedings.

Once the hearing date is set and the appeal documents have been transmitted, the appellate court shall have the parties served with notice of the appeal stating the date and time of the hearing in accordance with subdivision 1 of <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-296" target="_blank">§ 8.01-296</a></cite>.

     Application of standards to appeals from district courts to circuit courts.
    </b>
    - Where appellants contended that the application of standards to appeals from district courts to circuit courts, which are different that those standards applied to appeals from circuit courts to the court of appeals or to the Supreme Court, violated due process, this contention was without merit. In light of the opportunity to have the matter heard de novo in the circuit court, the appellants did not demonstrate that they were denied due process by the statutory requirement that they await entry of the district court's final order before seeking an appeal.

        Circuit court did not err in dismissing a mother's appeals of a juvenile and domestic relations district court's adjudicatory orders that her children were abused and neglected because the
    juvenile and domestic relations district court's dispositional orders, the final orders, were not entered until July 16, 2010, but the mother never appealed those orders, and the filing of the dispositional order appeal forms on June 1, 2010, was premature since there were no final orders from which the mother could appeal at that time; pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §
    
    16.1-296, only final orders of the district court could be appealed to the circuit court, and adjudicatory orders entered by a district court in child abuse and neglect cases are not final orders for purposes of appeal because they are not entered pursuant to

        Adoptive parents' failure to timely appeal the juvenile court's visitation order was of no legal consequence because there was no need for them to file a separate pleading to seek the termination of biological grandparents' visitation when entry of the order of adoption divested the grandparents of any right to visitation; the petition for adoption necessarily implied a question of the grandparents' ongoing visitation, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition.

        Circuit court erred because it acted as a court of appeals and did not conduct a de novo trial by asking a father to show where in the record he preserved his arguments; the circuit court did not conduct a new hearing on the underlying issues but rather reviewed the determination of the juvenile and domestic relations district court and rendered a decision based upon that review.

        Trial court properly dismissed a husband's appeal from an order of the juvenile court finding him in contempt and establishing an arrearage amount of $50,000, due to his failure to post the entire appeal bond, as the husband could not choose to bifurcate his appeal by appealing the show cause and other portions of the order but not that part establishing a support arrearage.

       <p>
        Trial court properly dismissed a father's appeal of a juvenile court order which modified his child support obligation and assessed an arrearage; a court clerk's act of setting an appeal bond at "0" did not excuse the father of the requirement to post an appeal bond under subsection H of this section and
    
     §
    
    16.1-109 did not allow for a cure where there was a total failure to comply with the bond requirement, and thus the failure to post the bond divested the trial court of jurisdiction. Sharma v. Sharma, 46 Va. App. 584, 620 S.E.2d 553, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 389</cite> (2005).

        Trial court did not err in requiring the father to post a bond for his appeal of the denial of the father's motion to reduce child support, because any order of the court related to the father's motion to reduce child support would be intrinsically related to the arrearage, thus requiring bond.

         Dismissal of appeal of bond amount only.
        </b>
        - Civil appeal bond was a procedural aspect of a final juvenile and domestic relations (J&DR) district court order and a party could not bifurcate the procedural aspects of a J&DR district court order from the underlying substantive ruling on appeal to circuit court. Therefore, dismissal of the party's appeal of bond amount only was appropriate for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Va. Div. of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Ines v. Curran, 100 Va.

         Appeal from commitment order.
        </b>
        - Although a juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to hold a commitment review hearing more than sixty days after the original commitment hearing, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:19 was applicable because the court convicted the juvenile of assault and battery of a family or household member, a misdemeanor. The case was properly before the circuit court, which had to hear the matter de novo, because the juvenile properly advised the juvenile court of the juvenile's intention to appeal the order and the court noted the intention to appeal and filed it in the clerk's office.

Subsection 1 gave the circuit court all the powers and authority granted to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. Palmer v. Mitchell, 91 Va. Cir. 487, 2016 Va. Cir.

         Lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

        - Because the dismissal order entered by a juvenile and domestic relations district court was not an appealable order, the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction when a mother elected to file her motion to amend or review order in the district court, seeking an increase in the amount of child support, and subsequently appealed.

It is as if no appeal to the circuit court was taken. Hence, the custody order of the district court remains in effect, and that court retains jurisdiction to enforce its orders. Hasty v.

    - Circuit court properly dismissed a father's complaint to amend custody and visitation because, while the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the father's refiled appeals, the parties' circumstances changed during the pendency of the nonsuit, the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the father's refiled appeals and did the only thing it could do.

    - Circuit court erred in holding that the juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR) could not amend an order while the appeal of a related case was pending because the order was different from those on appeal; the withdrawn appeals of JDR court orders became final upon their withdrawal and binding on the parties, and a father's complaint was barred by the withdrawn appeals because of their res judicata effect when their withdrawal made them final and binding.

        When a father withdrew his appeals the orders became final and were binding on the parties; accordingly, while the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the father's refiled appeals, the parties' circumstances changed during the pendency of the nonsuit because the withdrawn orders became final and binding on the parties, thereby superseding an order that the refiled nonsuits were seeking to modify.

     Appeal did not render order for fees void.

    - Statute stated that any court judgments on child support were in full effect upon appellant's withdrawal of his appeal to the circuit court; the statute did not render the circuit court orders regarding legal fees incurred by the non-appealing party void ab initio and thus unenforceable. The legal fees appellee incurred responding to the appeal did not disappear when appellant withdrew that appeal, and thus appellee was entitled to seek enforcement of those orders and be compensated for those costs.

         Support orders not suspended on appeal.
        </b>
        - Section 16.1-298, which governs appeals from juvenile court, makes appeals in cases involving child support fundamentally different from appeals from general district court in civil cases. While an appeal from general district court in a civil case means that the order and judgment of the lower court are annulled,
        §
        16.1-298 B provides that juvenile court orders for support of a spouse, parent, or child are not suspended on appeal. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va. Cir. 205, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Richmond 2002).

        The court shall require all law-enforcement agencies to take special precautions to ensure that law-enforcement records concerning a juvenile are protected against disclosure to any unauthorized person. The police departments of the cities of the Commonwealth, and the police departments or sheriffs of the counties, as the case may be, shall keep separate records as to violations of law other than violations of motor vehicle laws committed by juveniles. Such records with respect to such juvenile shall not be open to public inspection nor their contents disclosed to the public unless a juvenile 14 years of age or older is charged with a violent juvenile felony as specified in subsections B and C of § 16.1-269.1.

If a chief of police, sheriff or a designee has disclosed to a school principal pursuant to this section that a juvenile is a suspect in or has been charged with a crime listed above, upon a court disposition of a proceeding regarding such crime in which a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, convicted, found not guilty or the charges are reduced, the chief of police, sheriff or a designee shall, within 15 days of the expiration of the appeal period, if there is no notice of appeal, provide notice of the disposition ordered by the court to the school principal to whom disclosure was made. If the court defers disposition or if charges are withdrawn, dismissed or nolle prosequi, the chief of police, sheriff or a designee shall, within 15 days of such action provide notice of such action to the school principal to whom disclosure was made. If charges are withdrawn in intake or handled informally without a court disposition or if charges are not filed within 90 days of the initial disclosure, the chief of police, sheriff or a designee shall so notify the school principal to whom disclosure was made. In addition to any other disclosure that is permitted by this subsection, the principal in his discretion may provide such information to a threat assessment team established by the local school division. No member of a threat assessment team shall (a) disclose any juvenile record information obtained pursuant to this section or (b) use such information for any purpose other than evaluating threats to students and school personnel. For the purposes of this subsection, "principal" also refers to the chief administrator of any private primary or secondary school.

        - A prosecutor may not impeach the defendant with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications, and the attempt to so cross-examine defendant was not harmless error. Lavinder v. Commonwealth, 395 S.E.2d 211 (1990).

        - When the statutes are read in light of the supervisory power provided by the constitutional provision, they do not act to limit the school board's authority or duties, and instead they reiterated the school board's authority to investigate and discipline its juvenile students; it appeared that the school board would be an institution with a legitimate interest in the video of school bus misconduct, and that its access to the video should not be barred by the statute.

The chief judge may provide by rule that any juvenile licensed to operate a motor vehicle who has been charged with a traffic infraction may waive court appearance and admit to the infraction or infractions charged if he or she and a parent, legal guardian, or person standing in loco parentis to the juvenile appear in person at the court or before a magistrate or sign and either mail or deliver to the court or magistrate a written form of appearance, plea and waiver, provided that the written form contains the notarized signature of the parent, legal guardian, or person standing in loco parentis to the juvenile. An emancipated juvenile charged with a traffic infraction shall have the opportunity to waive court appearance and admit to the infraction or infractions if he or she appears in person at the court or before a magistrate or signs and either mails or delivers to the court or magistrate a written form of appearance, plea, and waiver, provided that the written plea form containing the signature of the emancipated juvenile is accompanied by a notarized sworn statement which details the facts supporting the claim of emancipated status. Whenever the sole purpose of a proceeding is to determine the custody of a child of tender years, the presence of such juvenile in court may be waived by the judge at any stage thereof.

      </h3>
      <p>
       Upon a court's disposition of a proceeding where a juvenile is charged with a crime listed in subsection G of § 16.1-260 in which a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent, convicted, found not guilty or the charges are reduced, the clerk of the court in which the disposition is entered shall, within 15 days of the expiration of the appeal period, if there has been no notice of an appeal, provide written notice of the disposition ordered by the court, including the nature of the offense upon which the disposition was based, to the superintendent of the school division in which the child is enrolled at the time of the disposition or, if he is not then enrolled in school, the division in which he was enrolled at the time of the offense. If the court defers disposition, or the charges are nolle prosequi, withdrawn, or dismissed the clerk shall, within 15 days of such action, provide written notice of such action to the superintendent of the school division in which the child is enrolled at such time or, if he is not then enrolled in school, the division in which he was enrolled at the time of the offense. If charges are withdrawn in intake or handled informally without a court disposition, the intake officer shall, within 15 days of such action, provide written notification of the action to the superintendent of the school division in which the child is enrolled at that time or, if he is not then enrolled in school, the division in which he was enrolled at the time of the offense.
       <br/>

      <p>
       If the child is not enrolled in the school division that receives notification under this section, the superintendent of that division may forward the notification to the superintendent of the school division where the child is enrolled.

      <p>
       A superintendent who receives notification under this section may disclose the information received to anyone to whom he or a principal disclosed that a petition had been filed. Further disclosure of information received under this section by the superintendent to school personnel is authorized only as provided in § 22.1-288.2.

The principal may further disseminate the information regarding a petition, after the juvenile has been taken into custody, whether or not the child has been released, only to those students and school personnel having direct contact with the juvenile and need of the information to ensure physical safety or the appropriate educational placement or other educational services.

     Policy of section.
    </b>
    - Statutes of this character originated in a policy not to permit the same uses to be made of records of juvenile courts as are frequently made of criminal records of courts of general jurisdiction, for the reason that juvenile proceedings are corrective in nature rather than penal. The child is looked upon not as a bad man, who should be punished, but as an erring child who needs help. Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">198 Va. 833</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 14 (1957).

     Questioning witness as to adjudication as delinquent not permitted.

    - In view of the provisions of the juvenile statutes no error was committed in refusing to allow defendant's counsel to ask a witness for the prosecution whether he had ever been adjudged a juvenile delinquent in a proceeding in a juvenile court involving a felonious offense or larceny, the purpose of the question being to affect the credibility of the witness. Questions which refer to the disposition of the child in a juvenile court are not permitted. Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">198 Va. 833</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 14 (1957).

The trial court erred in limiting the cross-examination of co-defendant, the Commonwealth's chief witness, to questions which did not include "not innocent" or "guilty" because the phrase "within the purview of the juvenile court law" did not effectively convey to the jury that co-defendant had, in fact, been found "guilty" by the juvenile court.

       The General Assembly, to ensure the prevention of juvenile crime and the imposition of appropriate and just sanctions and to make the most efficient use of community diversion and community-based and correctional resources for those juveniles who have been screened for needing community diversion or community-based services using an evidence-based assessment protocol or are before intake on complaints or the court on petitions alleging that the juvenile is a child in need of services, child in need of supervision, or delinquent, has determined that it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth to establish a community-based system of progressive intensive sanctions and services that correspond to the severity of offense and treatment needs. The purpose of this system shall be to deter crime by providing community diversion or community-based services to juveniles who are in need of such services and by providing an immediate, effective punishment that emphasizes accountability of the juvenile offender for his actions as well as reduces the pattern of repeat offending. In furtherance of this purpose, counties, cities or combinations thereof are encouraged to develop, implement, operate, and evaluate programs and services responsive to their specific juvenile offender needs and juvenile crime trends.

      <p>
       The Governor of Virginia is hereby authorized and requested to execute, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia, with any other state or states legally joining therein, a compact which shall be in form substantially as follows:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to (i) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (ii) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (iii) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (iv) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (v) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (vi) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (vii) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (viii) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (ix) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (x) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (xi) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (xii) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (xiii) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

       A.
    Bylaws.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members present and voting, within 12 months after the first Interstate Commission meeting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    Officers and staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairman and a vice-chairman, each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairman or, in the chairman's absence or disability, the vice-chairman shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission; provided that, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for any ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The Interstate Commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for such period, upon such terms and conditions, and for such compensation as the Interstate Commission may deem appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate Commission but shall not be a member and shall hire and supervise such other staff as may be authorized by the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    Qualified immunity, defense and indemnification.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The commission's executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by, arising out of, or relating to any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; however, any such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The liability of any commissioner or the employee or agent of a commissioner, acting within the scope of such person's employment or duties, for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within such person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director or the employees or representatives of the Interstate Commission and, subject to the approval of the attorney general of the state represented by any commissioner of a compacting state, shall defend such commissioner or the commissioner's representatives or employees in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such person.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. The Interstate Commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, the commissioner's representatives or employees, or the Interstate Commission's representatives or employees harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.

       Article VI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rulemaking Functions of the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
    The Interstate Commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    Rulemaking shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rulemaking shall substantially conform to the principles of the Model State Administrative Procedure Act, 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, vol. 15, p. 1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the U.S. Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall, at a minimum:
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Publish the proposed rule's entire text, stating the reasons for that proposed rule;
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Allow and invite any and all persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be added to the record and be made publicly available;
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Provide an opportunity for an informal hearing if petitioned by 10 or more persons; and
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on input from state or local officials or interested parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.
    Allow, not later than 60 days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the Interstate Commission's principal office is located for judicial review of such rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission's action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rulemaking record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedure Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.
    If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       F.
    The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superseded by this act shall be null and void 12 months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created hereunder.
      </p>
      <p>
       G.
    Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that a state of emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule that shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided hereunder shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 90 days after the effective date of the emergency rule.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oversight, Enforcement and Dispute Resolution by the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
    Oversight.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The Interstate Commission shall oversee the administration and operations of the interstate movement of juveniles subject to this compact in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in noncompacting states that might significantly affect compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall be received by all the judges, public officers, commissions, and departments of the state government as evidence of the authorized statute and administrative rules. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission, it shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    Dispute resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The compacting states shall report to the Interstate Commission on all issues and activities necessary for the administration of the compact as well as issues and activities pertaining to compliance with the provisions of the compact and its bylaws and rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a compacting state, to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to the compact and that may arise among compacting states and between compacting and noncompacting states. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact using any means set forth in Article XI of this compact.

      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff that shall be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states that governs said assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet them; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.
    The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IX.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State Council.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each member state shall create a State Council for Interstate Juvenile Supervision. While each state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership shall include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims groups, and the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator or deputy compact administrator. Each state council will advise and may exercise oversight and advocacy concerning that state's participation in Interstate Commission activities and other duties as may be determined by that state, including but not limited to development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.

      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than 35 of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment of the compact into law by the 35th jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Withdrawal, Default, Termination, and Judicial Enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
    Withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairman of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state's reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    Technical assistance, fines, suspension, termination, and default.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Alternative dispute resolution;
      </p>
      <p>
       c. Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission; and
      </p>
      <p>
       d. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the chief justice or the chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include but are not limited to failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state shall cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Within 60 days of the effective date of the termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       C.
    Judicial enforcement.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules, and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event that judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.
    Dissolution of compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
       <br/>

      <p>
       Article XII.
      </p>

       Severability and Construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
    The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
       <br/>

       Article XIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Binding Effect of Compact and Other Laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       A.
    Other laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       B.
    Binding effect of the compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. When there is a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation upon the request of a party to the conflict and upon a majority vote of the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. In the event that any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective, and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

        For purposes of this article, a serious or habitual juvenile offender is a minor who has been (i) adjudicated delinquent or convicted of murder or attempted murder, armed robbery, any felony sexual assault or malicious wounding, or a felony violation of a gang-related crime pursuant to Article 2.1 (§ 18.2-46.1 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2, or (ii) convicted at least three times for offenses which would be felonies or Class 1 misdemeanors if committed by an adult. Qualifying convictions or adjudications shall include only those for offenses occurring after July 1, 1993. However, any Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP) in existence on July 1, 1993, shall be deemed to have been established pursuant to this article and, notwithstanding the limitations of this subsection, may continue to supervise persons who were being supervised on July 1, 1993. Juvenile offenders under SHOCAP supervision at the time of their eighteenth birthday who have been committed to state care pursuant to subdivision A 14 of § 16.1-278.8 or § 16.1-285.1 may continue to be supervised by SHOCAP until their twenty-first birthday.

       <li id="t16.1c11a14.1s16.1-330.1ol1B">
        The Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP) is a multidisciplinary interagency case management and information sharing system which enables the juvenile and criminal justice system, schools, and social service agencies to make more informed decisions regarding juveniles who repeatedly commit serious criminal and delinquent acts. Each SHOCAP shall supervise serious or habitual juvenile offenders in the community as well as those under probation or parole supervision and enhance current conduct control, supervision and treatment efforts to provide a more coordinated public safety approach to serious juvenile crime, increase the opportunity for success with juvenile offenders and assist in the development of early intervention strategies.

        Any county or city in the Commonwealth may by action of its governing body establish a SHOCAP committee. The committee shall consist of representatives from local law enforcement, schools, attorneys for the Commonwealth, juvenile court services, juvenile detention centers or group homes, mental and medical health agencies, state and local children and family service agencies, and the Department of Juvenile Justice. Any county or city which establishes a SHOCAP committee shall, within 45 days of such action, notify the Department of Criminal Justice Services. The Department shall issue statewide SHOCAP guidelines and provide technical assistance to local jurisdictions on implementation of SHOCAP.

       <li id="t16.1c11a14.1s16.1-330.1ol1E">
        It shall be unlawful for any staff person from a member agency to disclose or to knowingly permit, assist or encourage the unauthorized release of any identifying information contained in any reports or records received or generated by a SHOCAP committee. A violation of this subsection shall be punishable as a Class 3 misdemeanor.

      <p>
       All records and reports concerning serious or habitual juvenile offenders made available to members of a SHOCAP committee and all records and reports identifying an individual offender which are generated by the committee from such reports shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed, except as specifically authorized by this article or other applicable law. Disclosure of the information may be made to other staff from member agencies as authorized by the SHOCAP committee for the furtherance of case management, community supervision, conduct control and locating of the offender for the application and coordination of appropriate services. Staff from the member agencies who receive such information will be governed by the confidentiality provisions of this article. The staff from the member agencies who will qualify to have access to the SHOCAP information shall be limited to those individuals who provide direct services to the offender or who provide community conduct control and supervision to the offender.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this article authorizing information sharing between and among SHOCAP committees shall take precedence over the provisions of (i) Article 12 (§ 16.1-299 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of this title governing dissemination of court and law-enforcement records concerning juveniles, (ii) Article 5 (§ 22.1-287 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 22.1 governing access to pupil records, (iii) Title 37.2 and any regulations enacted pursuant thereto governing access to juvenile mental health records, and (iv) Title 63.2 and any regulations enacted pursuant thereto governing access to records concerning treatments or services provided to a juvenile.

        It is the minor's own will that the minor enter into marriage, and the minor is not being compelled against the minor's will by force, threats, persuasions, menace, or duress;

        The marriage will not endanger the safety of the minor.

The magistrate shall also consider the recommendations of the minor's parents and of any treating or examining physician licensed in Virginia if available either verbally or in writing prior to rendering a decision.

      <p>
       After observing the minor and considering (i) the recommendations of any treating or examining physician or psychologist licensed in Virginia, if available, (ii) any past actions of the minor, (iii) any past mental health treatment of the minor, (iv) any qualified evaluator's report, (v) any medical records available, (vi) the preadmission screening report, and (vii) any other evidence that may have been admitted, the court shall order the involuntary commitment of the minor to a mental health facility for treatment for a period not to exceed 90 days if it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t16.1c11a16s16.1-345ol11">
        Because of mental illness, the minor (i) presents a serious danger to himself or others to the extent that severe or irremediable injury is likely to result, as evidenced by recent acts or threats or (ii) is experiencing a serious deterioration of his ability to care for himself in a developmentally age-appropriate manner, as evidenced by delusionary thinking or by a significant impairment of functioning in hydration, nutrition, self-protection, or self-control;
       </li>
       <li id="t16.1c11a16s16.1-345ol12">
        The minor is in need of compulsory treatment for a mental illness and is reasonably likely to benefit from the proposed treatment; and
       </li>
       <li id="t16.1c11a16s16.1-345ol13">
        If the court finds that inpatient treatment is not the least restrictive treatment, the court shall consider entering an order for mandatory outpatient treatment pursuant to § 16.1-345.2.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Upon the expiration of an order for involuntary commitment, the minor shall be released unless he is involuntarily admitted by further petition and order of a court, which shall be for a period not to exceed 90 days from the date of the subsequent court order, or the minor or his parent rescinds the objection to inpatient treatment and consents to admission pursuant to § 16.1-338 or subsection D of § 16.1-339 or the minor is ordered to mandatory outpatient treatment pursuant to § 16.1-345.2.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A minor who has been hospitalized while properly detained by a juvenile and domestic relations district court shall be returned to the detention home, shelter care, or other facility approved by the Department of Juvenile Justice by the sheriff serving the jurisdiction where the minor was detained within 24 hours following completion of a period of inpatient treatment, unless the court having jurisdiction over the case orders that the minor be released from custody. However, such a minor shall not be eligible for mandatory outpatient treatment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       In conducting an evaluation of a minor who has been properly detained, if the evaluator finds, irrespective of the fact that the minor has been detained, that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary commitment in this section, the evaluator shall recommend that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary commitment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the parent or parents with whom the minor resides are not willing to approve the proposed commitment, the court shall order inpatient treatment only if it finds, in addition to the criteria specified in this section, that such treatment is necessary to protect the minor's life, health, safety, or normal development. If a special justice believes that issuance of a removal order or protective order may be in the child's best interest, the special justice shall report the matter to the local department of social services for the county or city where the minor resides.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon finding that the best interests of the minor so require, the court may enter an order directing either or both of the minor's parents to comply with reasonable conditions relating to the minor's treatment.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the minor is committed to inpatient treatment, such placement shall be in a mental health facility for inpatient treatment designated by the community services board which serves the political subdivision in which the minor was evaluated pursuant to § 16.1-342. If the community services board does not provide a placement recommendation at the hearing, the minor shall be placed in a mental health facility designated by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a minor has been involuntarily committed pursuant to this section, the judge shall determine, after consideration of information provided by the minor's treating mental health professional and any involved community services board staff regarding the minor's dangerousness, whether transportation shall be provided by the sheriff or may be provided by an alternative transportation provider, including a parent, family member, or friend of the minor, a representative of the community services board, a representative of the facility at which the minor was detained pursuant to a temporary detention order, or other alternative transportation provider with personnel trained to provide transportation in a safe manner. If the judge determines that transportation may be provided by an alternative transportation provider, the judge may consult with the proposed alternative transportation provider either in person or via two-way electronic video and audio or telephone communication system to determine whether the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner. If the judge finds that the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner, the judge may order transportation by the proposed alternative transportation provider. In all other cases, the judge shall order transportation by the sheriff of the jurisdiction where the minor is a resident unless the sheriff's office of that jurisdiction is located more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place. In cases where the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the minor is a resident is more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place, it shall be the responsibility of the sheriff of the latter jurisdiction to transport the minor.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the judge determines that the minor requires transportation by the sheriff, the sheriff, as specified in this section shall transport the minor to the proper facility. In no event shall transport commence later than six hours after notification to the sheriff or alternative transportation provider of the judge's order.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If an alternative transportation provider providing transportation of a minor becomes unable to continue providing transportation of the minor at any time after taking custody of the minor, the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which the alternative transportation provider is located at the time he becomes unable to continue providing transportation shall take custody of the minor and shall transport the minor to the proper facility. In such cases, if the alternative transportation provider originally authorized to provide transportation is a person other than the minor's parent, the alternative transportation provider shall notify the minor's parent (a) that the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which he is located has taken custody of the minor and is transporting the minor to the facility of temporary detention and (b) of the name of the law-enforcement officer providing transportation of the minor.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       No person who provides alternative transportation pursuant to this section shall be liable to the person being transported for any civil damages for ordinary negligence in acts or omissions that result from providing such alternative transportation.

       Upon consideration of the factors set out in § 20-124.3 and finding that (i) the child's parent is a qualified parent and (ii) appointment of a standby guardian is in the best interest of the child, the court shall appoint a proper and suitable person as standby guardian and, if requested, a proper and suitable person as alternate standby guardian. However, when a petition is filed by a person other than a parent having custody of the child, the standby guardian shall be appointed only with the consent of the qualified parent unless the court finds that such consent cannot be given for medical reasons.

       The order shall specify the triggering event and shall provide that the authority of the standby guardian is effective (a) upon receipt by the standby guardian of (1) a determination of incompetence of the parent, (2) a certificate of death of the parent, (3) evidence of the detention, incarceration, or deportation of the parent connected to an immigration action, or (4) the earlier of clause (1), (2), or (3) or (b) if so requested in the petition, upon receipt by the standby guardian of a written consent of the qualified parent and filing of the consent with the court. The written consent shall be executed after the entry of the court order and signed by the qualified parent, or by another in his presence and on his behalf.

If a hearing is held, the party alleging that the juvenile is incompetent shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the juvenile's incompetency.

       If, at any time after the juvenile is ordered to undergo services pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-357, the agent providing restoration concludes that the juvenile is likely to remain incompetent for the foreseeable future, he shall send a report to the court so stating. The report shall also indicate whether, in the agent's opinion, the juvenile should be (i) committed pursuant to Article 16 (§ 16.1-335 et seq.) of this chapter or, if the juvenile has reached the age of eighteen years at the time of the competency determination, pursuant to Article 5 (§ 37.2-814 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 37.2, (ii) certified pursuant to § 37.2-806, (iii) provided other services by the court, or (iv) released. Upon receipt of the report, the court shall make a competency determination according to the procedures specified in subsection F of § 16.1-356. If the court finds that the juvenile is incompetent and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future, it shall order that the juvenile (i) be committed pursuant to Article 16 (§ 16.1-335 et seq.) of this chapter or, if the juvenile has reached the age of eighteen years at the time of the competency determination, pursuant to Article 5 (§ 37.2-814 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 37.2, (ii) be certified pursuant to § 37.2-806, (iii) have a child in need of services petition filed on his behalf pursuant to § 16.1-260 D, or (iv) be released. If the court finds the juvenile incompetent but restorable to competency in the foreseeable future, it may order restoration services continued until three months have elapsed from the date of the provision of restoration ordered under subsection A of § 16.1-357.

       If not dismissed without prejudice at an earlier time, charges against an unrestorably incompetent juvenile shall be dismissed in compliance with the time frames as follows: in the case of a charge which would be a misdemeanor, one year from the date of the juvenile's arrest for such charge; and in the case of a charge which would be a felony, three years from the date of the juvenile's arrest for such charges.

       Each psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, licensed professional counselor, licensed marriage and family therapist, or other expert appointed by the court to render professional service pursuant to § 16.1-356, shall receive a reasonable fee for such service. With the exception of services provided by state

If any such expert is required to appear as a witness in any hearing held pursuant to § 16.1-356, he shall receive mileage and a fee of $100 for each day during which he is required to serve. An itemized account of expenses, duly sworn to, must be presented to the court, and when allowed shall be certified to the Supreme Court for payment out of the state treasury, and be charged against the appropriations made to pay criminal charges. Allowance for the fee and for the per diem authorized shall also be made by order of the court, duly certified to the Supreme Court for payment out of the appropriation to pay criminal charges.
