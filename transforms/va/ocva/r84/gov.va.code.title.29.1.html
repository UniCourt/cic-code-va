As part of this study, the Department shall convene a stakeholder group for the purpose of developing and providing recommendations on access permit fees, various alternatives, and other issues related to the use and maintenance of Department-owned boat ramp facilities. The stakeholder work group shall be composed of representatives of registered boat owners, paddlecraft liveries, outdoor outfitters, environmental education providers, and other non-registered vessel recreational users of such boat ramps, or other affected parties the Department deems necessary. The work group shall consider mechanisms that will decrease the burden on outfitters, customers, education providers, and non-profit organizations; the usage of access fees to maintain or improve existing boat ramps and to add new boat ramps, paddlecraft launches, and public access points on Department-owned property; and alternative funding mechanisms and strategies that can increase access by economically disadvantaged users. DWR shall submit a report on the work group's recommendations to the Governor, the Secretary of Natural Resources, the House Agricultural, Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate Agricultural, Conservation and Natural Resources Committee, the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee by December 1, 2021.”

        Inland waters.
       </b>
       - An Indian who habitually resides on an Indian reservation or an Indian that is a member of a Virginia recognized tribe
       who resides in the Commonwealth is not required to obtain a license to fish in Virginia's inland waters, or to hunt or trap in Virginia. Members of the Virginia tribes that were parties to the Treaty of 1677 with England are not required to obtain a license to fish or oyster in Virginia's tidal waters provided the activity is limited to harvesting for sustenance. Virginia Indians are bound by the trapping, hunting and fishing laws and regulations of the Commonwealth regardless of whether they are on or off a reservation. See opinion of Attorney General to Robert W. Duncan, Executive Director, Virginia Department of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries, and Jack G. Travelstead, Commissioner, Virginia Marine Resources Commission, 12-044, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 59 (7/19/13).

     <p>
      There is hereby established a damage stamp program to provide for an available source of funds to be used to compensate damage to crops, fruit trees, commercially grown Christmas trees, nursery stock, livestock, colonies of bees, bee equipment and appliances, as defined in § 3.2-4400, or farm equipment that is caused by deer, elk, or bear, or by big game hunters. It is the intent of the General Assembly that persons suffering loss or damage as the result of these activities should be realistically compensated for damages that occurred to their property as the result of the activity. A local governing body shall encourage to the maximum extent possible the utilization of the damage stamp fund for payment of claims in keeping with the purposes of this article.

       (1) the person must come upon the land to hunt, swim, trap, camp, hike, or sightsee; and (2) no consideration must have been paid by the user to the landowner. Hamilton v. United States, 371 F. Supp. 230 (E.D. Va. 1974) (decided under former

       Assertion that the statute's limitation of liability provision must be a landowner's primary motivation for opening its land to the public in order for the statute to apply was incorrect. Rather, the only two pre-requisites listed in the statute were the requirement that the landowner not receive a fee in exchange for use of its property and the requirement that the property be used for a recreational purpose; because both of these pre-requisites were met, Virginia's recreational land use statute applied.

       - Visitor's visit to the federal memorial fit within the definition of sightseeing; simply put, the visitor and his relatives were going to see the memorial, a thing regarded as worth seeing. Notwithstanding his laudable objective of imparting American values on his visiting young relative, the visitor's trip to the memorial fit well within the parameters of the term sightseeing - he went to the memorial to see a sight of interest - thus, Virginia's recreational land use statute governed.

       </b>
       - There was no evidence that the United States made a deliberate decision to ignore the allegedly dangerous conditions that were present in the parking lot, nor was there any evidence that the United States consciously disregarded these conditions; at most, the evidence established that the United States was aware that the lights were out in the parking lot for approximately two weeks before the incident and that the United States had taken some unsuccessful steps to correct the issue. Though this might amount to ordinary negligence, it did not amount to the sort of egregious conduct or utter disregard of prudence necessary to establish gross negligence under Virginia law. Lutfi v.

       while allowing for a variety of legitimate secular uses of owl feathers, subdivision 10 of this section inexplicably denies an exception for bona fide religious uses and thereby draws specific subject matter distinctions in regulating the use of feathers.

        Section provides two related presumptions.
       </b>
       - This section first provides a presumption that any person is guilty of a violation who at night in possession of a specified type of weapon flashes a light from a vehicle without good cause. It then provides a second presumption that every person in or on "such vehicle" is a principal in the second degree. Thus, the second presumption incorporates the first. Only a person in or on a vehicle meeting the requirements of the first presumption is "deemed" to be a principal in the second degree under the second presumption. Wilson v. Commonwealth,
       <cite class="va_code">
        225 Va. 33
       </cite>
       , 301 S.E.2d 1 (1983)(decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        If the first presumption is invalid, the second necessarily falls;
       </b>
       if the first is valid, the second may not necessarily survive. Wilson v. Commonwealth,
       <cite class="va_code">

      <p>
       <b>
        Second presumption, if employed by the jury, operates only in a permissive or burden-of-production-shifting manner.
       </b>
       Such a presumption is not unconstitutional if there was a rational connection between the proved and presumed facts. Wilson v. Commonwealth,
       <cite class="va_code">
        225 Va. 33

      <p>
       <b>
        The presumption of guilt under this section is rebuttable
       </b>
       and is to be analyzed as a permissive inference, even if it is construed to require the defendants to produce some evidence of "good cause." The defendants, therefore, under this analysis, have no standing to make a facial attack on the constitutionality of the presumption by arguing that it would be unconstitutional if applied to others in hypothetical cases. Rather, they may challenge their conviction only on the basis that there was not a rational connection between the facts proved in their case and the presumption that was raised or that the latter did not flow more likely than not from the former.

       § 29.1-532. Dams and fishways.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any dam or other object in a watercourse, which obstructs navigation or the passage of fish, shall be deemed a nuisance, unless it is used to work a mill, factory or other machine or engine useful to the public, and is allowed by law or order of court. Any person owning or having control of any dam or other obstruction in the streams of the Commonwealth which may interfere with the free passage of anadromous and other migratory fish, shall provide every such dam or other obstruction with a suitable fishway unless the Board considers it unnecessary. The purpose of such a fishway is for anadromous and other migratory fish to have free passage up and down the streams during March, April, May and June, and down the streams throughout the remaining months. "Suitable fishway" means a fishway which passes significant numbers of the target fishes, as determined by the Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Owners of such dams or other authorized obstructions shall maintain and keep fishways operational, in good repair, and restore them in case of destruction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Owners of dams or other obstructions which are not authorized by law must have the obstacles removed at their expense when the Board determines that the obstacles interfere with the free passage of anadromous and other migratory fish within the streams of the Commonwealth.
     </p>
     <p>
      The circuit court of the county or city in which the dam is situated, after reasonable notice to the parties or party interested and upon satisfactory proof of the failure to comply, may order any necessary construction or destruction to be initiated or put in good repair at the expense of the owner of the dam or other obstruction. All such construction or destruction must be initiated within one year of the court order and completed within three years of the court order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person failing to comply with this section shall pay as a penalty a percentage of the estimated cost of construction or destruction equal to the percentage specified on the judgment rate of interest pursuant to §

       License fees for boats.

      - Counties in Virginia do not have the authority to impose a license fee on boats in lieu of personal property taxes; only the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has authority to administer and assess boat license fees. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Priscilla J. Davenport, Commissioner of the Revenue, Middlesex County, 15-085, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 18 (9/1/16).

Absence of an indication of a statutory or common-law lien on a certificate does not invalidate the lien.
