        And requiring miner to use due diligence as to safety of roof.
       </b>
       - A rule which says: "Don't start to work, especially after a shot, until you are sure your roof is safe," only requires the miner to use due diligence to see that he does not work under an unsafe roof, and due diligence in every case depends upon the attending circumstances. Hence an inexperienced miner, who resumed work after a shot, is not thereby precluded from recovering for injuries by a fall of slate an hour after a shot, where the condition of the roof was not glaringly dangerous.

     <p>
      A fan stoppage plan shall be prepared for each mine. Such plan shall be subject to approval by the Chief or his designated representative. Failure to comply with any requirement set forth in the approved plan is a violation of this section. Each fan stoppage plan shall require the following:

      <li id="t45.2sIIp0Bc08a04s45.2-834ol11">
       When the main fan fails or stops, the power shall be cut off from the mine and miners shall be withdrawn from all face areas.
      </li>
      <li id="t45.2sIIp0Bc08a04s45.2-834ol12">
       Miners shall be withdrawn from the underground areas if the ventilation is not restored within a reasonable time determined by the Chief, not to exceed 15 minutes. In determining such reasonable time period, the Chief shall consider, among other factors, the size and number of fans and the methane liberation rate of the mine.
      </li>
      <li id="t45.2sIIp0Bc08a04s45.2-834ol13">
       If ventilation is restored within the time period established in the plan, each face area and any other area in which methane is likely to accumulate shall be examined by a certified person, and if all areas are found to be free of explosive or harmful gases, power may be restored and work resumed.
      </li>
      <li id="t45.2sIIp0Bc08a04s45.2-834ol14">
       If ventilation is not restored within the time period established in the plan and the miners are evacuated from the mine, the main fan shall be operated for a period of time specified in the plan. Such period of time shall not be less than 15 minutes. Thereafter, the mine shall be examined by a certified person before any miner is permitted underground or any power circuit is energized.

       - Timbering activities, under the circumstances, did not constitute "coal surface mining operation"; facts showed that the timber sales agreement was separate from the mining agreement, the method used to remove trees was clear-cutting as opposed to grubbing, and the timbering operation removed timber that was outside the boundaries of the proposed surface mining permit, therefore defendant's logging activities were not, as a matter of law, "coal surface mining operations" and did not violate the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C.S.

       Any permittee who violates any permit condition or any other provision of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the Director, except that if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order, the civil penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation except that if the violation resulted in a personal injury or fatality to any person, then the civil penalty shall not exceed $70,000 for each violation. Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for the purposes of assessing penalties. In determining the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to the permittee's history of previous violations at the particular coal surface mining operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.

When appropriate, the Director shall consolidate such hearing with other proceedings pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any hearing under this section shall be a formal adjudicatory hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). If the person charged with such violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the Director after the Director determines that a violation has occurred and the amount of the penalty warranted and issues an order requiring that the penalty be paid.

Such permittee shall, within 30 days of being so informed, pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the permittee contests either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, forward the proposed amount to the Director for placement in an interest-bearing trust account in the state treasury. Failure to forward the money to the Director within 30 days constitutes a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty it is determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty will be reduced, the Director shall within 30 days of such determination remit the appropriate amount to the permittee with accrued interest thereon.

Upon such recording and indexing, there shall be a lien in favor of the Commonwealth on the property of the permittee within such county or city in the amount of the penalty.

        Federal cause of action for recovery of damages.

       - Section 520(f) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. Section 1270(f), provides a federal cause of action for the recovery of damages resulting from violation of state regulations that are a part of the state's surface coal mining and reclamation regulatory program approved by the United States Secretary of the Interior pursuant to Section 503 of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. Section 1253. Molinary v. Powell Mt. Coal Co., 125 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 1997).

        Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief was not properly before court.
       </b>
       - Where plaintiffs asked the court to require the defendant to comply with the terms of the notice of violation, since plaintiffs did not give written notice to the secretary and director before bringing suit, plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief based upon the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was not properly before the court time and was dismissed; however, plaintiffs were not precluded from taking further action to perfect their claim under subdivision A1.

        Plaintiffs failed to prove injuries were result of violations.
       </b>
       - Where plaintiffs claimed damages for injuries resulting from the defendant's violation of regulations issued under the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, plaintiffs failed to allege or to submit evidence tending to prove that the injuries suffered by them were the result of these violations rather than the result of the subsidence itself, which was not alleged to be a violation; thus, the claim failed to meet the statutory requirement for bringing an action under subsection G. Ball v. Island Creek Coal Co., 722 F. Supp. 1370 (W.D. Va. 1989).

      "Mining"
    means the breaking or disturbing of the surface soil or rock in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals or any activity constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use. "Mining" does not include (i) any aspect of deep mining that does not have a significant effect on the surface or (ii) excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of onsite farming or construction. Nothing in this section applies to the mining of coal. "Mining" does not include, and this title, chapter, or section shall not be construed to apply to, the process of searching, prospecting, exploring, or investigating for minerals by drilling.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      "Overburden"
    means all of the earth and other materials that lie above a natural deposit of minerals, ores, rock, or other solid matter and also other materials after removal from their natural deposit in the process of mining.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Reclamation"
    means the restoration or conversion of disturbed land to a stable condition that minimizes or prevents adverse disruption and the injurious effects of such disruption and presents an opportunity for further productive use if such use is reasonable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Refuse"
    means all waste soil, rock, mineral tailings, slimes, and other material directly connected with the mine or with the cleaning and preparation of substances mined, including all waste material deposited in the permit area from other sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Spoil"
    means any overburden or other material removed from its natural state in the process of mining.

        Compulsory pooling orders.
       </b>
       - The Virginia Gas and Oil Board is authorized to issue compulsory pooling orders to deem that unleased interests are leased when gas owners fail to elect to participate in the operation of the well. Furthermore, such action by the Board is a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's police power.
       See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. "Bud" Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Virginia Gas and Oil Act is constitutional, and the Act and the Virginia Gas and Oil Board provide appropriate protection of the due process rights of gas owners in the context of the compulsory pooling hearings and orders. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. "Bud" Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Virginia Gas and Oil Board may issue compulsory pooling orders that permit deduction of post-production costs downstream of the wellhead when computing gas owners' one-eighth royalty interests.

       Compulsory pooling orders.
      </b>
      - The Virginia Gas and Oil Board is authorized to issue compulsory pooling orders to deem that unleased interests are leased when gas owners fail to elect to participate in the operation of the well. Furthermore, such action by the Board is a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's police power.
      See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. "Bud" Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09).

      The Virginia Gas and Oil Board may issue compulsory pooling orders that permit deduction of post-production costs downstream of the wellhead when computing gas owners' one-eighth royalty interests.

Thus, a mineral or a water reservation does not reserve a geothermal resource, and a lease of oil, gas or some other mineral is not a lease of geothermal resources. The rights of the owner of a geothermal resource as related to the rights of owners of other property interests depend on the particular language of the instruments and all other relevant circumstances, as is the case generally in property law.

     <p>
      Applicable statutory or regulatory standards for geothermal resources refer only to temperature and volume but not to depth of the resource below the surface or type of use, whether residential or commercial. Heat pumps are not regulated by Virginia laws on geothermal resources, so long as they do not exceed threshold standards for temperature and volume.

      - In the absence of any legislation by the General Assembly establishing how geothermal resources are to be taxed, they are to be assessed either as leaseholds taxable as real estate to the lessees if leased or, if not leased, to be included as a factor affecting the assessed fair market value of the real estate they occupy, regardless of whether or not energy is being extracted from them. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Terry G. Kilgore, Member, House of Delegates, No. 14-012, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 71 (12/19/14).

       Rights to geothermal resources.
      </b>
      - Rights to geothermal resources belong to the owner of the surface property unless specifically conveyed. They are not encompassed within mineral or water rights. Thus, a mineral or a water reservation does not reserve a geothermal resource, and a lease of oil, gas or some other mineral is not a lease of geothermal resources. The rights of the owner of a geothermal resource as related to the rights of owners of other property interests depend on the particular language of the instruments and all other relevant circumstances, as is the case generally in property law.

      <p>
       State law banning conventional uranium mining was not preempted by federal law since regulating such mining was not an activity to protect against radiation hazards, and thus was not in any way regulated by the federal government outside of federal lands. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 1894, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4177, 204 L. Ed. 2d 377 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ban on conventional uranium mining was not preempted by the federal regulation of uranium milling and tailings storage since the ban did not mention uranium milling or tailings storage and, in view of the ban, there was no purpose in constructing a mill and tailings-management complex in the state and transporting out-of-state uranium ore into the state. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 1894, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4177, 204 L. Ed. 2d 377 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Federal preemption did not apply to the state's ban on conventional uranium mining since the federal objectives in regulating the safety of radiation hazards was not materially affected by the state ban.
