      </span>
      30-149 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the recodification of Title 63.1 of the Code of Virginia. This title, dealing with social services, was last revised in 1968. Since that time, the Department of Social Services has undergone extensive administrative and programmatic changes, including welfare reform. Revising this title provided an opportunity to delete provisions made obsolete by federal law and to update nomenclature. Also, the Departments of Blind and Vision Impaired and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing were transferred out of Title 63.1 and into Title 51.5.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Virginia Code Commission began working on this recodification in 2000. Staff utilized informal work groups made up of Department of Social Services staff and others with expertise in the field of social services to assist staff in making recommendations to the Code Commission. A draft report detailing the work of the Virginia Code Commission between June 2000 and October 2001 was circulated for public comment. The Commission completed its work on Title 63.1 and the recodification bill was introduced and passed at the 2002 Session of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, as Acts 2002, Chapter 747.

       Editor's note.
      </b>
      - Acts 2004, c. 814, which added the definition of "subsidized custody," in cl. 4 provides: "That the provisions of this act shall not become effective unless federal funds are made available through a federal Title IV-E waiver and an appropriation of funds effectuating the purposes of this act is included in the general appropriation act for the period July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2006, passed during the 2004 Session of the General Assembly and signed into law by the Governor." No funds were appropriated in the general appropriation bill for July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2006; therefore, the definition has been deleted from the section.

       <b>
        Constitutionality of religious exemption for child care centers.
       </b>
       - Virginia's exemption of religiously affiliated child care centers from state licensing requirements is constitutional. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L. Ed. 2d 969, 109 S. Ct. 837 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A law is not unconstitutional simply because it
    allows
    churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose; for a law to have forbidden effects, it must be fair to say that the
       <i>
        government itself
       </i>
       has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.
       Virginia, in exempting religious child care centers from its licensing requirement, cannot be said to be advancing religion through its own activities and influence; on the contrary, the objective observer should perceive this exemption as an accommodation of the exercise of religion rather than as a government endorsement of religion. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L. Ed. 2d 969, 109 S. Ct. 837 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of religious exemption.
       </b>
       - A regulatory statute's singular exemption of religious groups does not render its purpose suspect; where government acts with the
       proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of religion, there is no need to require that the exemption come packaged with benefits to secular entities. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L.

       - Virginia Department of Social Services (DSS) improperly deemed a relative a caretaker because absent a factual basis for the assertion that the relative was a person responsible for the child's care, DSS could not legally deem him so simply because of his residing presence in the home.

      </p>
      <p>
       Enabling statute limits the authority of Virginia Department of Social Services (DSS) to findings of abuse committed by a parent or "other person responsible" for the abused child's care; a person who is not in any way truly responsible for the child's care cannot be said, either by the courts or DSS, to be a "person responsible" for the child's care, and residing in the same home as the child, without more, does not change that fact.

       Request of agency records to calculate child support not allowed.
      </b>
      - Because a husband was requesting confidential information from a county agency to help calculate the proper amount of child support payments, the confidentiality of the agency's records was tantamount; therefore, the agency's motion to quash the husband's subpoena duces tecum was granted.

      When defendant had a subpoena duces tecum issued for records of the Department of Family Services regarding abuse or neglect of defendant or defendant's siblings as mitigating evidence should defendant be convicted of pending criminal charges, the subpoena was quashed because (1) defendant improperly requested the subpoena's issuance to obtain

        Immunity from suit for damages.
       </b>
       - In his official capacity the Director of the Department of Welfare (now Commissioner of Social Services) is not subject to any suit for damages because he is an officer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Any judgment against him for monetary damages would necessarily have to be satisfied out of the Commonwealth's treasury. Such suits against an unconsenting state are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. Wooldridge v. Virginia, 453 F. Supp. 1333 (E.D. Va. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Director of the Department of Welfare (now Commissioner of Social Services) was absolutely immune in his individual capacity from any damage action arising out of his recommendation regarding a petition for adoption where he was acting pursuant to a valid court directive in preparing and submitting his recommendation to the circuit court.

        The Commissioner's adoption of guidelines interpreting the statute was within his statutory authority.

       Although the General Assembly did not grant the Commissioner the authority to enact regulations, it did authorize him to "supervise the administration of the provisions of this title and ... [to] see that all laws pertaining to the [DSS] are carried out to their true intent and spirit." The Commissioner has exercised his authority under this section by establishing guidelines to be applied by the local departments of social services throughout the Commonwealth in interpreting the definitions of abuse and neglect provided by statute. Consequently, the guidelines were adopted pursuant to the Commissioner's authority to administer the statute and give effect to its true intent and spirit. Jackson v. W., 14 Va. App. 391, 419 S.E.2d 385 (1992).

However, the county officials were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of the hiring decision that selecting a local director on the basis of political affiliation violated the First Amendment.

        Local directors do not have authority to set social services policy.
       </b>
       - County officials' reliance on an applicant's political affiliation as a reason for not hiring her as a local director of a county department of social services violated the applicant's First Amendment rights because Virginia's social services scheme did not provide local directors with authority to set general goals and programs for social services. However, the county officials were entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established at the time of the hiring decision that selecting a local director on the basis of political affiliation violated the First Amendment.

     <p>
      Failure by the recipient to provide the required verification of immunizations shall result in a reduction in the amount of monthly assistance received from the TANF program until the required verification is provided. The reduction shall be $50 for the first child and $25 for each additional child for whom verification is not provided.

       - This section requires that an entrustment agreement be entered by either a "parent" or a "guardian," and since an aunt who was the legal custodian of the children at issue was neither their parent nor guardian, entrustment agreements she had executed with the department of social services were invalid and ineffective.

An entrustment agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities shall be executed in writing and notarized. An entrustment agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the father of a child born out of wedlock if the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable, or if such father is given notice of the entrustment by registered or certified mail to his last known address and fails to object to the entrustment within 15 days of mailing of such notice. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence that would refute such an affidavit. The absence of such an affidavit shall not be deemed evidence that the identity of the father is reasonably ascertainable. For purposes of determining whether the identity of the father is reasonably ascertainable, the standard of what is reasonable under the circumstances shall control, taking into account the relative interests of the child, the mother and the father.

        Father's rights cannot be terminated without notice.

       - Where the mother knows the identity of the father but refuses to reveal his identity, the father's rights in the child attach and cannot be terminated without due process notice. Augusta County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Unnamed Mother, 3 Va. App. 40, 348 S.E.2d 26 (1986).

        Order of publication to notify father who is not identified by mother.
       </b>
       - Where unnamed mother entered into an entrustment agreement for the adoption of her child, but refused to reveal father's identity, proper course for the circuit court was to enter an appropriate order of publication after granting the mother a reasonable opportunity to reveal the identity of the father so that notice of the entrustment agreement could be given to him pursuant to law.

       </b>

        Foster care plan.
       </b>
       - Trial court did not err in determining that a county department of social services
       involved a father in a foster care plan because the father's participation in the development of the foster care plans was limited by his incarceration and deportation; the father received two letters from the department: the first letter notified him that his children were in the custody of the department, and the second letter was sent when the goal was changed to adoption, and the father also was present at one juvenile and domestic relations district court hearing and was represented by his guardian ad litem at all of the foster care hearings.

        Goal of adoption.

       - Trial court properly found that a child was a child in need of services and approved the foster care plan with the goal of adoption because the child's mental condition was attributed to inconsistency in primary caregivers due in part to the frequent removals caused by the custodian's drug problems, the child needed the permanent stability that could only be found through continuing the foster care placement with the foster mother, and the trial court properly considered appropriate factors, including the best interests of the child, in making its decision.

        This section provides statutory scheme for permanent foster care placement.
       </b>
       That scheme is intended to provide a more permanent placement for a child in a particular foster home than is generally obtained in regular foster care, and yet does not, as in the case of adoption proceedings, serve as a vehicle for terminating parental rights. Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13 (1986).

        Permanent foster care is distinct and secondary alternative to adoption.
       </b>
       - A petition for permanent foster care is not a less drastic alternative to termination of parental rights.
       The court can only consider permanent foster care after it has determined that adoption, upon termination of residual parental rights, is not an alternative in a given case.
       Given this statutory preference, permanent foster care is a distinct, and secondary, alternative to adoption. Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep't of Social Servs., 10 Va. App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199 (1990), aff'd, Stanley v. Fairfax,

       - Since the statutes relating to adoption confer a beneficial interest they are to be liberally construed, particularly in a contest between the adopted son and the estate of his intestate foster parents; to a less extent when the contest is between the adopted son and the estate of some remote ancestor by adoption.

       Adoption statutes should be liberally construed to carry out the beneficent purposes of the adoption institution, and to protect the adopted child in the rights and privileges acquired by it as a result of the adoption. McFadden v. McNorton,

        Man may adopt child born to wife by artificial insemination.

       - A man by proceeding in accordance with this section may adopt a child born to his wife by artificial insemination with a third party donor's sperm. Welborn v. Doe, 10 Va. App. 631, 394 S.E.2d 732 (1990)(decided under prior law).

       <b>
        Jurisdiction over adoption petition.
       </b>
       - Adoptive parents' failure to timely appeal the juvenile court's visitation order was of no legal consequence because there was no need for them to file a separate pleading to seek the termination of biological grandparents' visitation when entry of the order of adoption divested the grandparents of any right to visitation; the petition for adoption necessarily implied a question of the grandparents' ongoing visitation, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Harvey v. Flockhart, 65 Va. App. 131, 775 S.E.2d 427 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court had no jurisdiction to hear a petition related to consent for adoption that was not a parental placement adoption, a circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction at all to hear the appeal as the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the JDR district court had in that court's original proceeding.

       </span>
       63.1-225 D (see now subsection C of this section) that the father's consent was withheld contrary to the best interest of the child, it failed to base that finding on a determination that a continuing relationship between the father and the child would be detrimental to the child's welfare; without parental consent, such a determination is necessary before courts can grant an adoption and terminate parental rights based on a child's best interest.

      </p>
      <p>
       Before an adoption may be granted over the objection of a natural parent on the basis that consent is being withheld contrary to the child's best interests, the trial court must make a prerequisite finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that a continued or expanded relationship would be detrimental to the child's welfare.

       - Consent to adoption by a stepfather was withheld by the natural father contrary to the best interests of the children sought to be adopted, where the father, an incarcerated felon, was motivated by a desire to deny the children the security of the family unit in the hope that he could preserve his legal affiliation with them and resume visitations at some future indefinite date determined by his parole.

        Child's best interest.

       - Where evidence clearly supported the trial court's finding that a father's continued relationship with a child was detrimental where the father had abandoned and sexually abused the child; an adoption was in the best interests of the child and father's consent to the adoption was being withheld contrary to the child's best interests.

       Circuit court properly determined that the termination of a father's parental rights on grounds that he was unfit as a parent was in the best interest of the child, and that the child should be placed for adoption, as sufficient evidence was presented of the father's inability to provide for the welfare of his child due to his incarceration and status as a convicted felon, his lack of employment and a stable home, his past drug abuse, and a history of violence toward women.

       - Trial court did not have the authority to grant the grandmother's petition to terminate the father's parental rights, and the fact that the petition to terminate was attached to the grandmother's petition for adoption did not affect the trial court's ability to consider the petition for adoption; the trial court followed the statutory scheme when it granted the petition for adoption, and the trial court did not err in proceeding with the adoption petition after granting the motion to strike on the termination petition.

While these are important, relevant factors, they must be considered in light of all the elements mandated by this statute.

        - Whether continuation of a parent-child relationship, or expanding the contacts between them, will be detrimental to the child cannot be answered by examining only the nonconsenting parent's fitness to be a custodial parent; the ramifications which a continuance or an expansion of the relationship will have upon the child's welfare must also be carefully considered, including consideration from the viewpoint that contacts or visitation with a noncustodial parent may be limited, restricted, or modified in time as circumstances dictate.

        Adoption without the biological mother's consent violated her due process rights because there was no finding, as required by Virginia law, that the mother's continuing relationship with her child would be detrimental to the child's welfare.

         Showing required for adoption over parent's objection.

        - Where there is no question of the fitness of the nonconsenting parent and he has not by conduct or previous legal action lost his rights to the child, it must be shown that continuance of the relationship between the two would be detrimental to the child's welfare for the child to be adopted over the parent's objection.

        Considering the finality of adoption as it affects the nonconsenting parent, something more is required than a mere showing of friction between contesting adults and of "some reaction" on the part of the child for an adoption over a natural parent's objection. Malpass v. Morgan,

        Petition for adoption filed by the mother and the stepfather was properly granted based on the trial court finding that the father's incarceration for sodomy of his child from another relationship prevented him from ever being able to obtain custody of the subject child while the child was a minor, the father would not be released from prison until the child was thirty-six years old, the father's willful acts he committed against his other minor child also prevented him from ever being able to obtain custody of the child, the mother had not thwarted the father's parental rights prior to his arrest, and the "heinous acts" that the father committed against his other biological child led to the conclusion that there was a risk for any other minor children.

        Purpose of section.
       </b>
       - This section provides that the court may revoke its interlocutory order of adoption at any time prior to the entry of the final order "for good cause shown." The purpose of this section and the interlocutory order is to provide an opportunity for inquiring into and considering matters which may have developed during the pendency of the order and which may constitute "good cause" for its revocation and the dismissal of the adoption proceeding.

        Interest of child is paramount issue.

        "For good cause shown."
       </b>
       - The expression "for good cause shown" employed by this section means that the court may take into consideration matters discovered during the pendency of the order, and if there is an unfavorable change in the situation and good cause is shown as to why the adoption should not be consummated, then the statute may be employed and the interlocutory order vacated. Bidwell v. McSorley,

        Good cause means more than changing of mind by parent.
       </b>
       - "For good cause shown" means more than the simple changing of the mind by the parent who has given consent to the adoption. Where the consent has been freely and knowingly given, and where it has been acted upon, it cannot be arbitrarily revoked. Bidwell v. McSorley,
       <cite class="va_code">
        194 Va. 135

       , 72 S.E.2d 245 (1952).

      <p>
       "Good cause shown" means something more than a mere change of mind by the parent who has consented to the adoption. Newton v. Wilson,

       Where no legal reason was established for disturbing an interlocutory order of adoption, it could not be set aside simply because the consenting mother had changed her mind. Bidwell v. McSorley,

        Consent of natural father becoming legal parent prior to final order.
       </b>
       - The fact that during the pendency of an interlocutory order in an adoption proceeding the child's natural father became its legal parent and had not given his consent to the adoption was a legally sufficient ground for vacating the order. Harmon v. D'Adamo,

        Putative father had no standing to intervene in adoption proceeding.
       </b>
       - Circuit court properly denied a putative father's request to intervene in an adoption proceeding because the father had neither standing to intervene nor a right to withhold his consent to the adoption since the record failed to establish his paternity; the putative father did not register as a putative father before the deadline for doing so expired under the Virginia Putative Father Registry.

       In the six months after entry of an adoption order, a person with standing may challenge an adoption order more than 21 days after its entry for any ground that would permit a challenge under the rule; after the six-month period has run, the statute prevents a person from challenging the adoption order even if one of the exceptions to the rule is present. This remains true even if the exception is based upon fraud, duress, failure to give notice, or lack of jurisdiction. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018

        Finality of adoption order.
       </b>
       - Grandparents were neither custodians nor guardians of the children at issue, and the father, through whom grandparents claimed their connection with the children, was alive and had his rights to the children terminated; neither the Constitution nor Virginia statutes required that the grandparents receive notice of the adoption proceeding, and thus the alleged lack of notice did not provide a basis to exempt the adoption order from the finality provisions of the rule. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018
       <cite class="va_code">

       </cite>
       (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because both orders were entered more than 21 days before the grandparents filed their initial pleading, they had to show that some exception to the rule's finality rule applied; absent an exception, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the grandparents' challenges to the order terminating father's parental rights or the order granting the adoption, and the circuit court correctly dismissed grandparents' challenge to these orders. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018

      </p>
      <p>
       Grandparents identified no statute or constitutional right that required they consent to the adoption; the only required consent was the consent of the department, which was the agency having custody of the children, and because all necessary consents were obtained and presented, the lack of consent by the grandparents did not provide a basis to exempt the adoption order from the finality provisions of the rule.

      </p>
      <p>
       To set aside or reopen the final order in either the termination case or the adoption case, grandparents had to both allege and prove the orders were obtained by fraud; the failure to even allege that fraud occurred was fatal to their attempt to reopen either case.

       Because maternal grandparents' second challenge to an adoption order was filed more than a year after the adoption was completed, the statute precluded the circuit court from considering the arguments raised in the second challenge, rendering the circuit court's order denying the maternal grandparents' petition to vacate a nullity; as a result, the court of appeals could not address the substance of the maternal grandparents' arguments.

        Non-English speaking father victim of fraud.
       </b>
       - Although the state has a compelling interest in preserving stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved, the application of the six-month statute of limitation was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of stability while simultaneously preserving a father's fundamental right to continue the pre-existing relationship with his biological child where the father, who could not speak or read English, alleged that he had never abandoned the child, that he had been induced by the child's maternal grandmother to sign a form consenting to the adoption by intrinsic and extrinsic fraud, and that he had not discovered that his parental rights had been terminated until after the six-month period had elapsed.

       - Although the six-month period referenced in the statute is longer than the twenty-one-day period in Va. Sup. Ct.

       - Circuit court properly denied a biological mother's petition to set aside the adoption of her two children because, despite learning of the adoption in 2010, she did not file a petition to set aside the adoption until 2016, she was statutorily prevented from attacking the final order of adoption, the trial court found that there was no evidence of fraud on the part of the adoptive mother, and the biological mother did not appeal that finding.

      A valid entrustment agreement terminating all parental rights and responsibilities to the child shall be revocable by either of the birth parents until (i) the child has reached the age of 10 days and (ii) seven days have elapsed from the date of execution of the agreement. In addition, a valid entrustment agreement shall be revocable by either of the birth parents if the child has not been placed in the physical custody of the prospective adoptive parents at the time of such revocation. Revocation of an entrustment agreement shall be in writing and signed by the revoking party. The written revocation shall be delivered to the child-placing agency or local board to which the child was originally entrusted. Delivery of the written revocation shall be made during the business day of the child-placing agency or local board to which the child was originally entrusted, in accordance with the applicable time period set out in this section. If the revocation period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or any day on which the agency or local board is officially closed, the revocation period shall be extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day on which the agency or local board is officially closed. Upon revocation of the entrustment agreement, the child shall be returned to the parent revoking the agreement.

       - Trial court did not err in granting the grandparents' adoption even though the mother had not consented where the mother had not sought custody or visitation with the child since her release from incarceration, she conceded that she was not able to assume custody, the mother's fetal alcohol syndrome and bipolar disorder and continued trouble managing her affairs and finances indicated an inability to care for the child, and removing the child from the grandparents would have disrupted a stable living arrangement that had existed since the child was four months old.

      Upon receipt of all orders from the clerk of the circuit court and adoption files from the child-placing agency or local board, the Commissioner shall have the authority to direct the storage and preservation of such records. The Commissioner shall have custody of and retain all adoption files, whether in paper or electronic form, including reports, orders, and other documents with identifying information of birth parents and adoptees, in his office or at another location designated by the Commissioner.

     <p>
      The Commissioner or his designee may direct adoption files, in whole or in part, to be microfilmed, digitally reproduced, copied, photographed, or otherwise duplicated for the purpose of preserving and retaining such files. The Commissioner may allow adoption files to be taken from his office or other designated location for the purpose of being microfilmed, digitally reproduced, copied, photographed, or otherwise duplicated, but shall take all necessary and proper precautions, by requiring bonds or otherwise, to ensure the preservation and return and to prevent the mutilation thereof. The Commissioner or his designee shall examine and compare the reproductions from the microfilm, digitally reproduced, copied, photographed, or otherwise duplicated records with the originals and, if satisfied that the copies are exact, certify them as true copies of the records retained by the Commissioner. The same faith and credit shall be given to such reproductions from the microfilm, digitally reproduced, copied, photographed, or otherwise duplicated record as the record reproduced would have been entitled to.

        Failure to register.
       </b>
       - Circuit court properly denied a putative father's request to intervene in an adoption proceeding because the father had neither standing to intervene nor a right to withhold his consent to the adoption since the record failed to establish his paternity; the putative father did not register as a putative father before the deadline for doing so expired under the Virginia Putative Father Registry.

       - Circuit court erred in granting a plea in bar by the adoptive parents and the mother on the basis that the putative father had no standing to appeal a legal decision made by the juvenile and domestic relations district court regarding the child because he was entitled to notice and participation in adoption proceedings regarding the child where he timely registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry, and once the mother revoked her consent, the petition had to be denied.

An exception may be made to the requirement that efforts be made to place the child in an adoptive home without the provision of adoption assistance when it is in the best interest of the child due to factors such as the development of significant emotional ties with his foster parents while in their care and the foster parents wish to adopt the child.

       When eligibility determination is made.
      </b>
      - Making a determination of eligibility for adoption assistance before the termination of parental rights - and thus prior to the child's being legally free for adoption - is inappropriate because Virginia Department of Social Services regulations and policy require that a child be free for adoption through termination of parental rights in order to be eligible. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).
     </p>
     <p>
      Local department of social services erred by determining, before a child became free for adoption, that he was not eligible for adoption assistance, as it thereby created a circumstance in which the adoptive parents' mere acceptance of the child into their home undercut their later efforts to appeal the eligibility determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Right to appeal denial of subsidy.
      </b>
      - Adoptive family's mere acceptance of a child - particularly when the acceptance is accompanied by the family's clear and unequivocal disagreement with the adoption subsidy determination - cannot itself serve as a basis for forestalling the adoptive family's statutory right to appeal that determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).

       Hard to place due to special needs.
      </b>
      - Hearing officer's finding that a child was not hard to place due to any special needs was not supported by substantial evidence, as it was based on the testimony of employees of a local department of social services regarding their subjective impressions of their ability to place the child in another home without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).

      <b>
       Special needs.
      </b>
      - Child had special needs, as 1) his birth parents' parental rights were terminated; 2) as a minority, he was hard to place; and 3) he had developed significant emotional ties with his foster family, thereby relieving the department of social services of the requirement to search for a family who would adopt the child without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).

      <b>
       Emotional ties.
      </b>
      - Requirement to make reasonable efforts to place a child without an adoption subsidy was not met, as the child had developed significant emotional ties with the foster family that adopted him; therefore, the local department of social services need not and should not have sought to place him for adoption without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).

       When eligibility determination is made.
      </b>
      - Local department of social services erred by determining, before a child became free for adoption, that he was not eligible for adoption assistance, as it thereby created a circumstance in which the adoptive parents' mere acceptance of the child into their home undercut their later efforts to appeal the eligibility determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).
     </p>
     <p>
      Making a determination of eligibility for adoption assistance before the termination of parental rights - and thus prior to the child's being legally free for adoption - is inappropriate because Virginia Department of Social Services regulations and policy require that a child be free for adoption through termination of parental rights in order to be eligible. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012).

     <p>
      Any applicant for or recipient of adoption assistance aggrieved by any decision of a local board or licensed child-placing agency in granting, denying, changing or discontinuing adoption assistance, may, within 30 days after receiving written notice of such decision, appeal therefrom to the Commissioner. Any applicant or recipient aggrieved by the failure of the local board or licensed child-placing agency to make a decision within a reasonable time may ask for review by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may delegate the duty and authority to duly qualified hearing officers to consider and make determinations on any appeal or review. The Commissioner shall provide an opportunity for a hearing, reasonable notice of which shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the proper local board in such manner and form as the Commissioner may prescribe. The Commissioner may make or cause to be made an investigation of the facts. The Commissioner shall give fair and impartial consideration to the testimony of witnesses, or other evidence produced at the hearing, reports of investigation of the local board and local director or licensed child-placing agency or of investigations made or caused to be made by the Commissioner, or any facts that the Commissioner may deem proper to enable him to decide fairly the appeal or review. The decision of the Commissioner shall be binding and considered a final agency action for purposes of judicial review of such action pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§

While it is clearly preferable for an investigating official to contact the accused and any interested party, it is not a prerequisite to a valid determination. J.P. v. Carter, 24 Va.

       Purpose of retention of "unfounded" reports.
       
       - Department of Social Services' own guidelines recognize the possibility of harm to a person wrongly accused of child abuse because in "Unfounded" cases, DSS must retain the report of the disposition in the central registry for up to two years if the individual involved so requests (see

       63.1-248.6 clearly authorized Department of Social Services to enter only one of two final disposition alternatives, "Founded" or "Unfounded," in a child protective services case. DSS regulations and guidelines expanding this statutory grant were inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory framework for the investigation and appeals process. Jackson v.

        Interests of child and accused to be protected.
       </b>
       - In child abuse cases, it is often necessary to take quick action to protect the child, and the initial determination of "cause to suspect" allows DSS to take such action. Before a final disposition of "Founded" may be entered, however, the evidence must be clear and convincing in order to protect not only the interests of the child but also the rights of the person accused.

        Destruction of case records did not render case moot.
       </b>
       - Although DSS guidelines provided for retention of "Unfounded" dispositions for up to two years, where appellee never had the benefit of having an "Unfounded" disposition entered in the central registry, the destruction of the case records did not render the case moot, because an "Unfounded" disposition entered in the central registry would have provided appellee with "effectual relief."

        "Shall" directory.

       - The word "shall" in the version of this section in force at the time was directory and affected appellant's procedural, not substantive rights; thus, none of the defendant's rights was infringed as a result of the delay in the circuit court's assumption of jurisdiction over the charges. J.B. v. Brunty, 21 Va. App. 300, 464 S.E.2d 166 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Social Services' failure to issue a determination of founded sexual abuse within forty-five days or to provide written justification for a fifteen day extension did not deprive it of jurisdiction, as the statutory time limits were directory and not mandatory, and, absent a showing of prejudice, the failure to act within those time limits did not provide grounds for reversal of the DSS determination.

      The Department shall implement a child-protective services differential response system in all local departments. The differential response system allows local departments to respond to valid reports or complaints of child abuse or neglect by conducting either an investigation or a family assessment. The Department shall publish a plan to implement the child-protective services differential response system in local departments by July 1, 2000, and complete implementation in all local departments by July 1, 2003. The Department shall develop a training program for all staff persons involved in the differential response system, and all such staff shall receive this training.

Pursuant to § 22.1-279.1, no teacher, principal or other person employed by a school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth shall subject a student to corporal punishment. However, this prohibition of corporal punishment shall not be deemed to prevent (i) the use of incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact or other actions designed to maintain order and control; (ii) the use of reasonable and necessary force to quell a disturbance or remove a student from the scene of a disturbance that threatens physical injury to persons or damage to property; (iii) the use of reasonable and necessary force to prevent a student from inflicting physical harm on himself; (iv) the use of reasonable and necessary force for self-defense or the defense of others; or (v) the use of reasonable and necessary force to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects or controlled substances or paraphernalia that are upon the person of the student or within his control. In determining whether the actions of a teacher, principal or other person employed by a school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth are within the exceptions provided in this section, the local department shall examine whether the actions at the time of the event that were made by such person were reasonable.

The local department shall also notify the Child-Protective Services Unit within the Department whenever a child is taken into custody.

       When a child is taken into custody by a child-protective services worker of a local department pursuant to subsection C, that child shall be returned as soon as practicable to the custody of his parent or guardian. However, the local department shall not be required to return the child to his parent or guardian if the circumstances are such that continuing in his place of residence or in the care or custody of such parent or guardian, or custodian or other person responsible for the child's care, presents an imminent danger to the child's life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result or if the evidence of abuse is perishable or subject to deterioration before a hearing can be held. If the local department cannot return the child to the custody of his parents or guardians within 72 hours, the local department shall obtain an emergency removal order pursuant to § 16.1-251.

If the local department refuses the request for amendment or fails to act within 45 days after receiving such request, the person may, within 30 days thereafter, petition the Commissioner, who shall grant a hearing to determine whether it appears, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the determination or record contains information which is irrelevant or inaccurate regarding the commission of abuse or neglect by the person who is the subject of the determination or record and therefore shall be amended. A person who is the subject of a report who requests an amendment to the record, as provided above, has the right to obtain an extension for an additional specified period of up to 60 days by requesting in writing that the 45 days in which the local department must act be extended. The extension period, which may be up to 60 days, shall begin at the end of the 45 days in which the local department must act. When there is an extension period, the 30-day period to request an administrative hearing shall begin on the termination of the extension period.

       The Commissioner shall designate and authorize one or more members of his staff to conduct such hearings. The decision of any staff member so designated and authorized shall have the same force and effect as if the Commissioner had made the decision. The hearing officer shall have the authority to issue subpoenas for the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses. The hearing officer is authorized to determine the number of depositions that will be allowed and to administer oaths or affirmations to all parties and witnesses who plan to testify at the hearing. The Board shall adopt regulations necessary for the conduct of such hearings. Such regulations shall include provisions stating that the person who is the subject of the report has the right (i) to submit oral or written testimony or documents in support of himself and (ii) to be informed of the procedure by which information will be made available or withheld from him. In case of any information withheld, such person shall be advised of the general nature of such information and the reasons, for reasons of privacy or otherwise, that it is being withheld. Upon giving reasonable notice, either party at his own expense may depose a nonparty and submit such deposition at the hearing pursuant to Board regulation. Upon good cause shown, after a party's written motion, the hearing officer may issue subpoenas for the production of documents or to compel the attendance of witnesses at the hearing, except that alleged child victims of the person and their siblings shall not be subpoenaed, deposed or required to testify. The person who is the subject of the report may be represented by counsel at the hearing. Upon petition, the court shall have the power to enforce any subpoena that is not complied with or to review any refusal to issue a subpoena. Such decisions may not be further appealed except as part of a final decision that is subject to judicial review. Such hearing officers are empowered to order the amendment of such determination or records as is required to make them accurate and consistent with the requirements of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder. If, after hearing the facts of the case, the hearing officer determines that the person who is the subject of the report has presented information that was not available to the local department at the time of the local conference and which if available may have resulted in a different determination by the local department, he may remand the case to the local department for reconsideration. The local department shall have 14 days in which to reconsider the case. If, at the expiration of 14 days, the local department fails to act or fails to amend the record to the satisfaction of the appellant, the case shall be returned to the hearing officer for a determination. If aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer, such person may obtain further review of the decision in accordance with Article 5 (§

        Motion to remand.

However, the court was limited to reviewing the agency record to determine whether substantial evidence supported the administrative hearing officer's finding. Moon v. Va. Dep't of Soc.

It could not have been said that after reviewing the record as a whole a reasonable mind would inevitably or unavoidably determine that the victim's allegations were false. Sherman v. Va.

       Circuit court did not err in concluding that there was substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's decision of a founded disposition of sexual abuse (sexual molestation) - Level One because the evidence proved that the father told the child to spread her legs and then rubbed her external genital area with his bare hand for as much as 50 seconds; the hearing officer accepted the mother's reporting of the incident and the 14-year-old half-sister's reporting of the child's statement that she had hair on her private parts like her father did; and the hearing officer stated that the doctor who performed a court-ordered psychosexual evaluation found that the father had little credibility.

        Findings by local department of social services.
       </b>
       - Adult protective services include investigating reports of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult and issuing any written findings; thus, any findings of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult resulting from an adult protective services investigation undertaken by a local department of social services is not a case decision of the State Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, but rather a decision by a city or county agency.

        County department of social services exempt from Virginia Administrative Process Act.

       - Because a county department of social services was a unit of county government and exempt from the Virginia Administrative Process Act, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear a daughter's appeal of its decision; at no time did a state agency make a finding against the daughter, and consequently, the statutory right to judicial review of the case decision of an administrative agency under the Act did not apply.

       As used in this section, "person" means any individual; corporation; partnership; association; limited liability company; local government; state agency, including any department, institution, authority, instrumentality, board, or other administrative agency of the Commonwealth; or other legal or commercial entity that operates or maintains a child welfare agency, adult day care center, or assisted living facility.

       Every person who constitutes, or who operates or maintains, an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency shall obtain the appropriate license from the Commissioner, which may be renewed. However, no license shall be required for an adult day care center that provides services only to individuals enrolled in a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly program operated in accordance with an agreement between the provider, the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Commissioner, upon request, shall consult with, advise, and assist any person interested in securing and maintaining any such license. Each application for a license shall be made to the Commissioner, in such form as he may prescribe. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is an association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the names and addresses of its officers and agents. The application shall also contain a description of the activities proposed to be engaged in and the facilities and services to be employed, together with other pertinent information as the Commissioner may require. In the case of an application for licensure as a children's residential facility, the application shall also contain information regarding any complaints, enforcement actions, or sanctions against a license to operate a children's residential facility held by the applicant in another state.

      <li id="t63.2sIVc17a01s63.2-1701ol11C">
       The licenses shall be issued on forms prescribed by the Commissioner. Any two or more licenses may be issued for concurrent operation of more than one assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency, but each license shall be issued upon a separate form. Each license and renewals thereof for an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency may be issued for periods of up to three successive years, unless sooner revoked or surrendered.
      </li>
      <li id="t63.2sIVc17a01s63.2-1701ol11D">
       The length of each license or renewal thereof for an assisted living facility shall be based on the judgment of the Commissioner regarding the compliance history of the facility and the extent to which it meets or exceeds state licensing standards. On the basis of this judgment, the Commissioner may issue licenses or renewals thereof for periods of six months, one year, two years, or three years.
      </li>
      <li id="t63.2sIVc17a01s63.2-1701ol11E">
       The Commissioner may extend or shorten the duration of licensure periods for a child welfare agency whenever, in his sole discretion, it is administratively necessary to redistribute the workload for greater efficiency in staff utilization.
      </li>
      <li id="t63.2sIVc17a01s63.2-1701ol11F">
       Each license shall indicate the maximum number of persons who may be cared for in the assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency for which it is issued.

      <li id="t63.2sIVc17a01s63.2-1701ol11G">
       The license and any other documents required by the Commissioner shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises.

      The Commissioner may grant a variance to a regulation when the Commissioner determines that (i) a licensee or applicant for licensure as an assisted living facility, adult day center or child welfare agency has demonstrated that the implementation of a regulation would impose a substantial financial or programmatic hardship and (ii) the variance would not adversely affect the safety and well-being of residents, participants or children in care. The Commissioner shall review each allowable variance at least annually. At a minimum, this review shall address the impact of the allowable variance on persons in care, adherence by the licensee to any conditions attached, and the continuing need for the allowable variance.

Such contract shall require the interim administrator to comply with any and all requirements established by the Department to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents.

Such notice shall be served on the assisted living facility or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the assisted living facility.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to perform his duties under this subtitle, the Commissioner may enter and inspect any unlicensed child or adult care operation with the consent of the owner or person in charge, or pursuant to a warrant. Administrative search warrants for inspections of child or adult care operations, based upon a petition demonstrating probable cause and supported by an affidavit, may be issued ex parte by any judge having authority to issue criminal warrants whose territorial jurisdiction includes the child or adult care operation to be inspected, if he is satisfied from the petition and affidavit that there is reasonable and probable cause for the inspection. The affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect has been sought and refused, or that facts and circumstances exist reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent. Such facts may include, without limitation, past refusals to permit inspection or facts establishing reason to believe that seeking consent would provide an opportunity to conceal violations of statutes or regulations. Probable cause may be demonstrated by an affidavit showing probable cause to believe that the child or adult care operation is in violation of any provision of this subtitle or any regulation adopted pursuant to this subtitle, or upon a showing that the inspection is to be made pursuant to a reasonable administrative plan for the administration of this subtitle. The inspection of a child or adult care operation that has been the subject of a complaint pursuant to §

      shall have preeminent priority over any other inspections of child or adult care operations to be made by the Commissioner unless the complaint on its face or in the context of information known to the Commissioner discloses that the complaint has been brought to harass, to retaliate, or otherwise to achieve an improper purpose, and that the improper purpose casts serious doubt on the veracity of the complaint. After issuing a warrant under this section, the judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by §

       <b>
        Constitutionality of religious exemption for child care centers.
       </b>
       - Virginia's exemption of religiously affiliated child care centers from state licensing requirements is constitutional. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L. Ed. 2d 969, 109 S. Ct. 837 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A law is not unconstitutional simply because it
    allows
    churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose; for a law to have forbidden effects, it must be fair to say that the
       <i>
        government itself
       </i>
       has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.
       Virginia, in exempting religious child care centers from its licensing requirement, cannot be said to be advancing religion through its own activities and influence; on the contrary, the objective observer should perceive this exemption as an accommodation of the exercise of religion rather than as a government endorsement of religion. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L. Ed. 2d 969, 109 S. Ct. 837 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of religious exemption.
       </b>
       - A regulatory statute's singular exemption of religious groups does not render its purpose suspect; where government acts with the
       proper purpose of lifting a regulation that burdens the exercise of religion, there is no need to require that the exemption come packaged with benefits to secular entities. Forest Hills Early Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Grace Baptist Church, 846 F.2d 260 (4th Cir. 1988), cert. denied sub nom. Forest Hills Early Learning Center, Inc. v. Jackson, 488 U.S. 1029, 102 L.

The children's residential facility shall inform the applicant that he is entitled to obtain a copy of any background check report and to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any such report and obtain a prompt resolution before a final determination is made of the applicant's eligibility to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children. The applicant shall provide the children's residential facility with a written statement or affirmation disclosing whether he has ever been convicted of or is the subject of pending charges for any offense within or outside the Commonwealth. The results of the criminal history background check must be received prior to permitting an applicant to work in the children's residential facility.

     <p>
      With such funds as are appropriated for this purpose, the Commissioner shall establish a toll-free telephone line to respond to complaints regarding operations of assisted living facilities, adult day care centers and child welfare agencies. Upon receipt of a complaint concerning the operation of an assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency, regardless of whether the program is subject to licensure, the Commissioner shall, for good cause shown, cause an investigation to be made, including on-site visits as he deems necessary, of the activities, services, records and facilities. The assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency shall afford the Commissioner reasonable opportunity to inspect all of the operator's activities, services, records and facilities and to interview its agents and employees and any child or other person within its custody or control. Whenever an assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency subject to inspection under this section is determined by the Commissioner to be in noncompliance with the provisions of this subtitle or with regulations adopted pursuant to this subtitle, the Commissioner shall give reasonable notice to the assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency of the nature of its noncompliance and may thereafter take appropriate action as provided by law, including a suit to enjoin the operation of the assisted living facility, adult day care center or child welfare agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      An incident report filed by an assisted living facility, pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board, for any major incident that negatively affects or threatens the life, health, safety, or welfare of any resident of the facility shall not be considered a complaint for purposes of this section and shall not be posted by the Department on a website maintained by the Department. However, upon receipt of an incident report for any major incident that negatively affects or threatens the life, health, safety, or welfare of any resident of an assisted living facility, the Commissioner may initiate an investigation including an on-site visit to the facility if the Commissioner finds, for good cause shown based upon the seriousness of the incident and the nature of any response to the incident, including any implementation of a plan of correction to address the situation giving rise to the incident, that an investigation is required to protect the life, health, safety, or welfare of a resident of the assisted living facility.

       § 63.2-1804. Uniform assessment instrument.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A uniform assessment instrument setting forth a resident's care needs shall be completed for all residents upon admission and at subsequent intervals as determined by regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. No uniform assessment instrument shall be required to be completed upon admission if a uniform assessment instrument was completed by a case manager or other qualified assessor within ninety days prior to such admission to the assisted living facility unless there has been a change in the resident's condition within that time which would affect the admission. Uniform assessment instruments shall not be required to be completed more often than once every twelve months on individuals residing in assisted living facilities except that uniform assessment instruments shall be completed whenever there is a change in the resident's condition that appears to warrant a change in the resident's approved level of care. At the request of the assisted living facility, the resident's representative, the resident's physician, the Department or the local department, an independent assessment, using the uniform assessment instrument shall be completed to determine whether the resident's care needs are being met in the current placement. The resident's case manager or other qualified assessor shall complete the uniform assessment instrument for public pay residents or, upon request by the private pay resident, for private pay residents. Unless a private pay resident requests the uniform assessment instrument be completed by a case manager or other qualified assessor, qualified staff of the assisted living facility or an independent private physician may complete the uniform assessment instrument for private pay residents; however, for private pay residents, social and financial information which is not relevant because of the resident's payment status shall not be required. The cost of administering the uniform assessment instrument pursuant to this section shall be borne by the entity designated pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. Upon receiving the uniform assessment instrument prior to admission of a resident, the assisted living facility administrator shall provide written assurance that the facility has the appropriate license to meet the care needs of the resident at the time of admission.

     <p>
      A licensed child-placing agency, children's residential facility or independent foster home shall have the right to accept, for any purpose not contrary to the limitations contained in its license, such children as may be entrusted or committed to it by the parents, guardians, relatives or other persons having legal custody thereof, or committed by any court of competent jurisdiction. The agency, facility or home shall, within the terms of its license and the agreement or order by which such child is entrusted or committed to its care, have custody and control of every child so entrusted or committed and accepted, until he is lawfully discharged, has been adopted, or has attained his majority. An entrustment agreement for the termination of parental rights and responsibilities with respect to such child shall be executed in writing and notarized.
     </p>
     <p>
      An agency that is licensed as a child-placing agency by the Department and certified as a proprietary school for students with disabilities by the Department of Education shall not be required to take custody of any child placed in its special education program but shall enter into a placement agreement with the parents or guardian of the child concerning the respective responsibilities of the agency and the parents or guardian for the care and control of the child. Such an agency shall conform with all other legal requirements of licensed child-placing agencies including the provisions of §§ 16.1-281 and 16.1-282.
     </p>
     <p>
      A licensed private child-placing agency may accept placement of a child through an agreement with a local department where the local department retains legal custody of the child or where the parents or legal guardian of the child retain legal custody but have entered into a placement agreement with the local department or the public agency designated by the community policy and management team.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a licensed child-placing agency accepts legal custody of a child, the agency shall comply with §§ 16.1-281 and 16.1-282.
     </p>
     <p>
      A children's residential facility licensed as a temporary emergency shelter may accept a child for placement provided that verbal agreement for placement is obtained from the parents, guardians, relatives or other persons having legal custody thereof, within eight hours of the child's arrival at the facility and provided that a written placement agreement is completed and signed by the legal guardian and the facility representative within 24 hours of the child's arrival or by the end of the next business day after the child's arrival.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the efficient and accurate collection, accounting and receipt of support for financially dependent children and their custodians, and to further the effective and timely enforcement of such support while ensuring that all functions in the Department are appropriate or necessary to comply with applicable federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonattorney employees of the Department are authorized to complete, sign and file petitions and motions on forms approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia relating to the establishment, modification, or enforcement of support in Department cases in the juvenile and domestic relations district courts. Orders entered prior to July 1, 2008, shall not be deemed void or voidable solely because such petitions and motions were signed by nonattorney employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      When so ordered by the court or the Department, support for financially dependent children and their custodians shall be paid by obligors to the Department's State Disbursement Unit (SDU) or in district offices located within the Commonwealth for processing by the SDU. The Department shall have authority to enter into contracts with any appropriate public or private entities to enforce, collect, account for and disburse payments for child or spousal support.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Division of Child Support Enforcement within the Department shall be authorized to issue payments to implement the disbursement of funds pursuant to the provisions of this section.

        Division may act as party on appeal.

       - Nothing in subparagraph 4 denies the Division of Child Support Enforcement the right to act as a party in court when an obligor appeals from an administrative agency case decision. Subparagraph 4 just prevents the Division from taking administrative actions to enforce support payments that are in arrears unless the arrearages have accrued under a prior court or administrative order.

       - Where Division did nothing more than defend against appeal from administrative order to the juvenile court and prosecute an appeal to the circuit court to uphold the administrative order, such actions could not be fairly characterized as enforcement of "support in arrears" in violation of subparagraph 4. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172 (1994).

       </b>
       - Nothing in Rule 8:20 permits the notice of appeal to be filed by a person who is a regular and bona fide employee of the party. Therefore, because the notice of appeal was not filed by the Division's attorney, the requirement of Rule 8:20 was not followed in filing the notice of appeal and the circuit court never acquired jurisdiction over the appeal of the child support matter from the juvenile court. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172 (1994).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Commissioner may proceed against a noncustodial parent whose support debt has accrued or is accruing based upon subrogation to, assignment of, or authorization to enforce a support obligation. Such obligation may be created by a court order for support of a child or child and spouse or decree of divorce ordering support of a child or child and spouse. In the absence of such a court order or decree of divorce, the Commissioner may, pursuant to this chapter, proceed against a person whose support debt has accrued or is accruing based upon payment of public assistance or who has a responsibility for the support of any dependent child or children and their custodial parent. The administrative support order shall also provide that support shall continue to be paid for any child over the age of 18 who is (i) a full-time high school student, (ii) not self-supporting, and (iii) living in the home of the parent seeking or receiving child support, until such child reaches the age of 19 or graduates from high school, whichever comes first. The Commissioner shall initiate proceedings by issuing notice containing the administrative support order which shall become effective unless timely contested. The notice shall be served upon the debtor (a) in accordance with the provisions of §

        Due process satisfied.
       </b>
       - This section satisfies the constitutional requirements of due process by providing a responsible party with notice and an opportunity to be heard before the judgment is final. Morris v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 77, 408 S.E.2d 588 (1991).

       Although a claimant argued his due process rights were violated when he was not served with a Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support order prior to workers' compensation carriers paying the claimant's child support arrearage to the Department of Child Support Enforcement from a settlement award, the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction to interpret the service requirements for Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support orders because interpretation of the service requirements for Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support orders was not a question "arising under" the Workers' Compensation Act. Minor v. Aramark/VCU &amp; Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 59 Va. App. 622, 721 S.E.2d 818 (2012).

      <p>
       <b>
        Right to seek superseding judicial relief.
       </b>
       - An administrative support order remains always vulnerable to displacement by a superseding judicial act, and both the obligor and obligee are entitled to initiate proceedings to obtain such relief, without the necessity of proving fraud, accident or surprise. Commonwealth ex rel. Breakiron v. Farmer, 32 Va. App. 430, 528 S.E.2d 183 (2000).
      </p>

       <b>
        The doctrine of laches was unavailable as a defense to the Commonwealth's claim for past public assistance paid
       </b>
       for the benefit of child, since the doctrine may not be set up as a defense against the Commonwealth acting in its government capacity. Morris v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 77, 408 S.E.2d 588 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Failure to challenge administrative order bars collateral attack.
       </b>
       - An administrative order under which a party who was believed to be the father of a child had been ordered to pay support could not be collaterally attacked in a subsequent enforcement proceeding in which it was determined that the party was not the child's father; although the party could be relieved of any future obligation to pay support his failure to appeal the administrative support order at its inception or to thereafter commence an appropriate judicial proceeding to supersede the order barred him from challenging his responsibility for the arrearage that had accrued under the order. Commonwealth ex rel. Breakiron v. Farmer, 32 Va. App. 430, 528 S.E.2d 183 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Time limitation not jurisdictional bar.
       </b>
       - Although this section provides that an administrative support order shall become effective unless contested within ten days, it does not create a jurisdictional bar. Carmon v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Jones, 21 Va. App. 749, 467 S.E.2d 815 (1996).

        Service of process and notice issues barred by res judicata.
       </b>
       - Because the trial court, in the order on appeal, had already determined the issues raised by father by finding that his appearance and participation in the October 1996 hearing was a general appearance that waived all questions about service of process and notice, and he had abandoned his only remedy of an appeal from said order, his further attempt to litigate those same issues was barred by res judicata.

       Workers' compensation settlement.
       
       - When workers' compensation carriers received an administrative order from the Department of Child Support Enforcement stating a claimant owed a child support arrearage in the amount of $22,784.46 and the carriers paid that amount from the claimant's $30,000 settlement proceeds, the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission properly determined it lacked authority to invalidate the Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support order because the validity of the order was not a question "arising under" or "otherwise provided for" the Workers' Compensation Act,

      . However, the issue to be determined by the hearing officer is limited to whether the support debtor has any interest in the joint account which is being held based on the support debtor's contribution to the account. Upon satisfactory proof that the support debtor has no interest in the joint account, the Department shall release the order to withhold. Upon receipt of the copy of the notice to the joint account holders, the financial institution or broker-dealer shall treat the initial order to withhold as continuing in effect over the entire property being withheld until a release or order to deliver is served by the Department or until the ninety-day period set forth in the following paragraph expires. If the financial institution or broker-dealer does not receive a copy of the notice to the joint account holders within 45 days from delivery of its answer, it may treat the order to withhold as released.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the determination that the support debtor has some interest in the joint account, the Department shall initiate a petition in the general district court or in the circuit court, if the joint account and the amount claimed against the support debtor each exceed $10,000, for the jurisdiction in which the support debtor or any joint account owner resides in order that the court may make a determination of the extent of the interest of the support debtor in the joint account, based on the amount the support debtor contributed to the account. If the support debtor and all account owners are nonresidents, venue shall be where the support obligee resides or where the property is located. In cases where the joint account is owned by persons married to each other, the funds in the account shall belong to them equally unless there is clear and convincing evidence otherwise. The Department shall serve a copy of the petition on the financial institution or broker-dealer by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the financial institution or broker-dealer does not receive a copy of the petition within ninety days of receipt of the notice to the joint account holders, it may treat the order to withhold as released.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding service or receipt of such order of support, the financial institution may pay any check deposited with it or another financial institution on or before the date of service or receipt of the order of support on it.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Commissioner is authorized and shall, as feasible, enter into agreements with financial institutions doing business in the Commonwealth to develop and operate, in conjunction with such financial institutions, a data match system using automated data exchanges to the maximum extent feasible. Pursuant to a data match system, a financial institution shall provide on a periodic basis, but no more frequently than every three months, the account title, record address, social security number or other taxpayer identification number, for any person in arrears in the payment of child support who is identified by the Department in the request by social security number or other taxpayer identification number.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such agreement shall provide for the following:

     <ol>
      <li id="t63.2s0Vc19a06s63.2-1932ol111">
       The financial institution shall be obligated to match only those accounts for which a social security number or taxpayer identification number is provided by the Department, and shall have no obligation to match or identify any account based on a person's name or any other identifying information;
      </li>
      <li id="t63.2s0Vc19a06s63.2-1932ol112">
       The financial institution shall provide the account title, record address, social security number or taxpayer identification number for any account matching the social security number and taxpayer identification number provided by the Department. It shall be the Department's responsibility to determine whether such account is an account subject to a lien, or order to withhold and deliver in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;
      </li>
      <li id="t63.2s0Vc19a06s63.2-1932ol113">
       The financial institution shall be given a reasonable time in which to respond to each data match request, based upon the capabilities of the financial institution to handle the data match system, but in no event less than thirty days; and

       The financial institution shall have no obligation to hold, encumber, or surrender assets in any account based on a match until it is served with a lien or order to withhold and deliver in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
       <p>
        The Department is authorized to pay a reasonable fee to a financial institution for conducting the data match, not to exceed the actual costs incurred by such financial institution and may assess and recover actual costs incurred from noncustodial parents identified as a result of the data match.
       </p>
       <p>
        A financial institution providing information in accordance with this section shall not be liable to any account holder or other person for any disclosure of information to the Department, for encumbering or surrendering any assets held by such financial institution in response to a lien or order to withhold and deliver issued by the Department, or for any other action taken pursuant to this section, including individual or mechanical errors, provided such action does not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

      , the Commissioner may collect the support debt stated in such lien by distraint, seizure and sale of the property subject to such lien. The Commissioner shall give notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or electronic means to the debtor and by certified mail, return receipt requested, to any person known to have or claim an interest therein of the general description of the property to be sold and the time and place of sale of such property. A notice specifying the property to be sold shall be posted in at least two public places in the jurisdiction wherein the distraint has been made. The time of sale shall not be less than 10 nor more than 20 days from the date of posting of such notices. Such sale shall be conducted by the Commissioner, who shall proceed to sell such property by parcel or by lot at a public auction, and who may set a minimum reasonable price to include the expenses of making a levy and of advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for such property at the sale is not equal to the price so fixed, the Commissioner may declare such property to be purchased by the Department for such price, or may conduct another sale of such property pursuant to the provisions of this section. In the event of sale, the debtor's account shall be credited with the amount for which the property has been sold. Property acquired by the Department as herein prescribed may be sold by the Commissioner at public or private sale, and the amount realized shall be placed in the state general fund to the credit of the Department. In all cases of sale, as aforesaid, the Commissioner shall issue a bill of sale or a deed to the purchaser and such bill of sale or deed shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the Commissioner to make such sale and conclusive evidence of the regularity of his proceeding in making the sale and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title, and interest of the debtor in such property. The proceeds of any such sale, except in those cases wherein the property has been acquired by the Department, shall be first applied by the Commissioner to reimbursement of the costs of distraint and the sale, and thereafter in satisfaction of the delinquent account. Any excess which shall thereafter remain in the hands of the Commissioner shall be refunded to the debtor. Sums so refundable to a debtor may be subject to seizure or distraint by any taxing authority of the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions or by the Commissioner for new sums due and owing subsequent to the subject proceeding. Except as specifically provided in this chapter, there shall be exempt from attachment, distraint, seizure, execution and sale under this chapter such property as is exempt therefrom under the laws of this Commonwealth.

       § 63.2-1934. Action for foreclosure of lien; satisfaction.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever a support lien has been filed, an action in foreclosure of lien upon real or personal property may be brought in the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein such real or personal property is or was located and the lien was filed. Judgment if rendered in favor of the Department shall be for the amount due, with costs, and the court shall allow, as part of the costs, the moneys paid for making and filing the claim of lien, and a reasonable attorney's fee. The court shall order any property upon which any lien provided for by this chapter is established, to be sold by the sheriff of the proper jurisdiction to satisfy the lien and costs. The payment of the lien debt, costs and reasonable attorney's fees, at any time before sale, shall satisfy the judgment of foreclosure. Where the net proceeds of sale upon application to the debt claimed do not satisfy the debt in full, the Department shall have judgment over any deficiency remaining unsatisfied and further levy upon other property of the judgment debtor may be made under the same execution. In all sales contemplated under this section, advertising of notice shall only be necessary for two weeks in a newspaper published in the jurisdiction where such property is located, and if there be no newspaper therein, then in the most convenient newspaper having a circulation in such jurisdiction. Remedies provided for herein are alternatives to remedies provided for in other sections of this chapter.
