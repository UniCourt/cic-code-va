      <p>
       Whenever a county and one or more sanitary districts have entered into an agreement for a unified water supply or sewerage system, or unified water supply and sewerage system, and such county has agreed therein to pay from the revenues of such unified system the principal of and interest on all bonds issued for water or sewer purposes, or both, as the case may be, by such sanitary district or districts, and to impose such schedule of rates, rentals, fees and charges for the use and services of such unified system so as to produce revenues sufficient for such payment, such county may also apply the revenues derived from such rates, rentals, fees and charges to the payment of the cost of operation and maintenance of the unified system, to the cost of renewals and replacements and to any other lawful purposes connected with or pertaining to such unified system, including the making of additions to and expansions of such unified system, to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued by such county for the purpose of such unified system and to the creation and maintenance of such reserves as may be deemed necessary by such county to effect any financing for such unified system. The order of any priority of the application of such revenues to any of the foregoing purposes, including to the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds of the sanitary districts, may be determined by the board of supervisors as the governing body of the county. If at any time the revenues derived from rates, rentals, fees and charges for the use and services of such unified system, are insufficient to provide for the operation and maintenance of the unified system, and for payment of principal of and interest on such bonded indebtedness of the sanitary district as the same shall become due, such sanitary district shall levy an annual tax upon all property in such sanitary district subject to local taxation to pay such principal and interest as the same shall become due. Nothing contained in the immediately preceding sentence shall, however, be construed to relieve the county of its obligations under any such agreement to impose rates, rentals, fees and charges for the use and services of such system sufficient to pay such costs of operation and maintenance and to provide for the payment of such principal and interest.

     Intent of 1948 amendment to Chapter 161 of Acts of 1926.

    - By the 1948 amendment to Chapter 161 of the Acts of 1926, the judge of a circuit court is prohibited from entering an order reducing the size of a sanitary district after the issue and sale of sanitary district bonds. The obvious legislative intent in prohibiting the reduction of a sanitary district after bonds have been issued was to prevent impairment of the security for the payment of the outstanding bonds. The sanitary district statutes make no other provision for the protection of bondholders. County of Fairfax v. City of Alexandria, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 82</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 101 (1951).

       When term bonds have been issued the net revenue derived from the operation of such systems shall be set apart by the said board to pay the interest on the bonds so issued or to be issued, and to create a sinking fund to redeem the principal thereof at maturity. The board of supervisors is hereby authorized and empowered to apply any part or all of said sinking fund to the payment, if redeemable by their terms, or to the purchase of any such bonds, at any time, and all bonds so paid off or purchased by the board of supervisors shall be immediately cancelled, and shall not be reissued. The board of supervisors is authorized and empowered to invest all accumulations of money to the credit of the sinking fund in bonds of the United States, of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or of any county, city or town of the Commonwealth of Virginia, or to lend out, upon real estate security, the loan not to exceed fifty per centum of the assessed value of such real estate, or deposit in bank at interest, all accumulations of money to the credit of the sinking fund and to collect and reinvest the same and the interest accruing thereon from time to time, so often as is necessary or expedient, until the bonds become subject to call; provided that no money to the credit of the sinking fund shall be loaned out or deposited or invested by the board of supervisors unless such loan, deposit or investment is first approved by the circuit court of the county, or the judge in vacation, and the form of the security be examined and approved by the attorney for the Commonwealth of the county, which approval shall be entered of record in the order book of the court.

       The treasurer shall not be liable for any funds herein provided for that are lost while on deposit made by order of the board of supervisors with any bank or banks, or when invested in any real estate security as provided herein, but the board of supervisors may require of any such bank a bond, with corporate or other surety, to secure such deposit, or may require a pledge of securities to secure such deposits as provided in §§ 58.1-3158 and<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.2.html#t2.2sIIp0Bc44s2.2-4400" target="_blank"> 2.2-4400</a></cite>.

       The board of supervisors shall, if necessary for the payment of interest on the bonds or to increase the sinking fund provided for hereunder, levy an annual tax upon all property in such sanitary district subject to local taxation to pay such interest and to make payments into such sinking fund. For the purposes of this section and § 21-137.2, the words
       "serial bonds"
       and
       "term bonds"
       shall have the respective meanings customarily given them in the municipal bond market.

    - The owner, lessee, tenant or some or all of them, of any real estate which is directly or indirectly connected with the disposal system discharging sewage therein is liable to pay the fees and charges fixed by the commission, measured by water used. Bott v. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">190 Va. 775</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 306 (1950), the opinion inadvertently citing

       <p>
        Under the Sanitation Districts Law no one is compelled to connect with the disposal system. He has the option of providing his own disposal facilities if he chooses, but when he connects with the disposal system he must pay his portion of the cost of it. One cannot discharge the sewage from four apartment buildings into the system, with knowledge of the Sanitation Districts Law, accepting the services and benefits of it, and at the same time claim that he has not contracted "for the same." The law under such circumstances will imply a contract on his part. Bott v. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n, <cite class="va_code">190 Va. 775</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 306 (1950).

      <p>
       From any action of the sanitation commission in prescribing fees, rents and charges, or either of them, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, an appeal may be taken upon the petition of any county or city constituting a part of the district, or upon petition of any 50 persons, resident or doing business in the district, to the State Corporation Commission. At least 60 days prior to filing such petition with the State Corporation Commission, such county, city or interested parties shall notify the sanitation commission of such intended petition and of the fees, rents and charges complained of, in order that the sanitation commission may be afforded an opportunity to make such changes in such fees, rents and charges as it shall deem proper. After such petition shall have been filed with the State Corporation Commission and after such county or city or other petitioners shall have, if required by the State Corporation Commission, executed and filed with the State Corporation Commission a bond payable to the Commonwealth and sufficient in amount, but not in excess of $5,000, and security to insure the prompt payment of all costs which may be assessed against such county or city or other petitioners, and after such county or city or other petitioners shall have caused to be published in at least one newspaper, designated by the commission and of general circulation within the district, such notice of such appeal as shall be prescribed by the State Corporation Commission, the State Corporation Commission is authorized to make such examinations and studies, to hold such hearings as may be required, to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of records, memoranda, papers and other documents before the State Corporation Commission or any officer or agent thereof, to administer oaths and to take testimony thereunder, and to fix in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to the sanitation commission, subject to the right of further appeal by the sanitation commission or the interested parties to the Supreme Court, such fees, rents and charges. In each such appeal proceeding the State Corporation Commission shall ascertain the costs incurred by it, including in such costs actual expenses incurred and a fair apportionment of overhead expenses, and shall assess the same against either the petitioner or petitioners, or the sanitation commission, or shall apportion the costs between the petitioner or petitioners and the sanitation commission, according to principles applicable in courts of equity.

Such county, city or town is vested with powers to do everything necessary or proper to carry out and perform every such contract, including the same powers with respect to fees, rents and other charges as are conferred by this chapter upon a commission, and to provide for the payment or discharge of any obligation thereunder by the same means and in the same manner as any other of its obligations, except that no tax shall be levied on real estate for such obligation. The commission is authorized to reduce ratably in accordance with such contract the fees, rents and other charges which would otherwise be charged by the commission to the owners or lessees or tenants of real estate within such county, city or town, but nothing in this section or any such contract shall be construed to prevent the commission from charging to and collecting from such owners or lessees or tenants of such real estate, in the same manner as provided for such fees, rents and other charges, any deficiency in any payment agreed to be made by such county, city or town.

       No county, city, town or other public body, or person shall discharge, or suffer to be discharged, directly or indirectly into any tidal waters of the district any sewage, industrial wastes or other refuse which may or will cause or contribute to pollution of any tidal waters of the district, provided, that this provision shall be applicable only to such part or parts of the tidal waters of a district as shall be bounded and described in a notice, published in a newspaper or newspapers having, in the aggregate, general circulation in all of the counties and cities within which or bordering upon which such part or parts of the tidal waters of the district are located, to the effect that the commission has provided facilities reasonably sufficient in its opinion for the disposal of sewage, which by discharge from public sewer systems might cause or contribute to pollution of the bounded and described part or parts of such tidal waters, and that pollution of the same is forbidden by law. Such a notice shall constitute prima facie evidence of the existence of facilities sufficient for the disposal of such sewage. The provisions of this section shall not prohibit the disposal of sewage and industrial wastes in the manner in which the same is now being disposed of, or in any other reasonable manner, by any county, city or town, no part of which constitutes a part of any district, or by any person in any such county, city or town, no part of which constitutes a part of any district.

       In and for each district heretofore or hereafter created pursuant to this chapter or pursuant to a special act of the General Assembly, a commission is hereby created as a body corporate, invested with the rights, powers and authority and charged with the duties set forth in this chapter. The commission shall be known by the name of the district, except that the word "commission" shall be substituted for the word "district." Except as a special act creating the district shall otherwise provide, the commission shall consist of seven members, residents of the district, appointed by the State Health Commissioner, in the manner hereinafter provided, who shall notify each governing body immediately after such appointments. Representation on the commission shall be apportioned among the political segments of the district on a population basis so far as it may be practical to do so; but each political segment, however, shall be entitled to at least one representative on the commission; and all appointments thereto shall be made by the State Health Commissioner from a list of not less than one nor more than five names furnished to him by the respective governing bodies of each political segment of the district. Except as a special act creating the district shall otherwise provide, in making the original appointments, one of the members shall be appointed for a term of one year, two for a term of two years, two for a term of three years, and two for terms of four years each; subsequent appointments shall be made for a term of four years, except appointments to fill vacancies which shall be for the unexpired terms. Members of the commission shall hold office until their successors have been duly appointed and qualified.

     Governmental immunity.
    </b>
    - In situations involving governmental, rather than proprietary functions, a municipal corporation is entitled to governmental immunity under Virginia law.
    See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable R. Creigh Deeds, Member, Senate of Virginia,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.12.html#t12c12-033" target="_blank"> 12-033</a></cite>, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 17 (5/18/12).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to whether a particular entity is a municipal corporation, the entity must have a preponderance of the following attributes: (1) creation as a body corporate and politic and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth; (2) creation to serve a public purpose; (3) power to have a common seal, to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold and dispose of its revenue, personal and real property; (4) possession of the power of eminent domain; (5) power to borrow money and issue bonds which are tax exempt, with interest on such bonds enjoying the same status under tax laws as the interest on bonds of other political subdivisions of the state; and (6) management of the corporation vested in a board of directors or a commission.

     Governmental immunity.
    </b>
    - In situations involving governmental, rather than proprietary functions, a municipal corporation is entitled to governmental immunity under Virginia law.
    See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable R. Creigh Deeds, Member, Senate of Virginia,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.12.html#t12c12-033" target="_blank"> 12-033</a></cite>, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 17 (5/18/12).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to whether a particular entity is a municipal corporation, the entity must have a preponderance of the following attributes: (1) creation as a body corporate and politic and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth; (2) creation to serve a public purpose; (3) power to have a common seal, to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold and dispose of its revenue, personal and real property; (4) possession of the power of eminent domain; (5) power to borrow money and issue bonds which are tax exempt, with interest on such bonds enjoying the same status under tax laws as the interest on bonds of other political subdivisions of the state; and (6) management of the corporation vested in a board of directors or a commission.

       From any action of the sanitation commission in prescribing fees, rents and charges, or either of them, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, an appeal may be taken upon the petition of any county, city or town constituting a part of the district, or upon petition of any fifty persons, resident or doing business in the district, to the State Corporation Commission. At least sixty days prior to filing such petition with the State Corporation Commission, such county, city or town or interested parties shall notify the sanitation commission of such intended petition and of the fees, rents and charges complained of, in order that the sanitation commission may be afforded an opportunity to make such changes in such fees, rents and charges as it shall deem proper. After such petition shall have been filed with the State Corporation Commission and after such county, city or town or other petitioners shall have, if required by the State Corporation Commission, executed and filed with the State Corporation Commission a bond payable to the Commonwealth and sufficient in amount, but not in excess of $500, and security to insure the prompt payment of all costs which may be assessed against such county, city or town or other petitioners and after such county, city or town or other petitioners shall have caused to be published in at least one newspaper, designated by the State Corporation Commission and of general circulation within the district, such notice of such appeal as shall be prescribed by the State Corporation Commission, the State Corporation Commission is authorized to make such examinations and studies, to hold such hearings as may be required, to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of records, memoranda, papers and other documents before the State Corporation Commission or any officer or agent thereof, to administer oaths and to take testimony thereunder, and to fix in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to the sanitation commission, subject to the right of further appeal by the sanitation commission or the interested parties to the Supreme Court, such fees, rents and charges. In each such proceeding the State Corporation Commission shall ascertain the costs incurred by it, including in such costs actual expenses incurred and a fair apportionment of overhead expenses, and shall assess the same against either the petitioner or petitioners, or the sanitation commission, or shall apportion the costs between the petitioner or petitioners and the sanitation commission, according to principles applicable in courts of equity.

The question so submitted shall be "Do you favor the issuance of not exceeding $. . . . . . . . . . . . bonds of the . . . . . . . . . . . . sanitation district commission (inserting the amount of bonds stated in such resolution and the name of the commission)?"

     Cost of relocating facilities due to street improvements.

    - The sanitation district, a public utility and political subdivision of the Commonwealth, must bear the cost of relocation of a sewer line installed by it in a street right-of-way of a city when required for street improvements.

       <p>
        Acts 1960, c. 66, cl. 10(k) does not alter the common-law rule that a public utility is required to relocate and/or adjust at its own expense its facilities located in public streets and highways when such relocation and/or adjustment is necessary to facilitate street and highway improvements. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n v. City of Chesapeake, <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 696</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 819 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing in Acts 1960, c. 66, cl. 10(k) to indicate it was the intent of the legislature that if it became necessary to relocate Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission's lines, due to improvements to a street made by a city, then the city would bear the expense of relocating the district's facilities.

     The General Assembly may create drainage districts.

    - There seems to be no doubt whatever, in the absence of some constitutional inhibition, of the power of the General Assembly to provide for the drainage and reclamation of swamp lands by the creation of local drainage districts, to delegate their power to local agencies to organize and control systems of drainage within their boundaries, and to assess the cost thereof against the property thereby benefited.

       Whenever the board of viewers shall make a survey for the purpose of locating a public levee or drainage project or changing a natural watercourse, and the same would cross the right-of-way of a railroad company it shall be the duty of the board of viewers promptly to notify the railroad company by serving written notice, accompanied by plans and profiles, upon the agent of such company or its lessee or receiver, that they will meet the company's representative at the place where the proposed ditch, drain, or watercourse crosses the right-of-way of such company, or at such other place as may be agreed upon by the respective parties. The meeting shall not be less than ten days after the service of notice fixing the time of the same, for the purpose of conferring with the railroad company with relation to the place where and the manner in which such improvements shall cross such right-of-way. When the time fixed for such conference shall arrive, unless for good cause more time is agreed upon, it shall be the duty of the board of viewers and the railroad company to agree, if possible, upon the place where and the manner and method in which such improvement shall cross such right-of-way. If, however, the board of viewers and the railroad company cannot agree, the whole matter shall be reported to the court by the board of viewers, and by the court referred to the State Corporation Commission as arbiters. The fact that the railroad company is required by the construction of the improvement to build a new bridge or culvert or to enlarge or strengthen an old one, shall be considered as damages to the railroad company to the extent of the actual cost thereof, as provided in § 21-359.

Such new bond shall not be executed or delivered until the holder of the mutilated, lost or destroyed bond (1) has paid the reasonable expense and charges in connection therewith and (2) in the case of a lost or destroyed bond, has filed with the board of viewers and the county treasurer satisfactory evidence that such bond was lost or destroyed and that the holder was the owner thereof and (3) has furnished indemnity satisfactory to the county treasurer.

Any landowner may file an answer denying any material allegation in the notice or setting forth any valid objection to the same before the return day thereof. Upon the day when the notice is returnable, or on such day, as to which the same may have been continued, the board of viewers shall proceed to hear the answers. If they find that the answers are not material, and that the issue of additional bonds is advisable or necessary, it shall make an appropriate order authorizing and directing the issue of such additional bonds, fixing the amount of the issue, the date of the same, the time when the interest and principal shall be payable, and all other matters necessary and appropriate in the premises. Any landowner may appeal from the order of the board of viewers, as provided by Chapter 26 (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-669" target="_blank">§ 8.01-669</a></cite> et seq.) of Title 8.01, and on such appeal only the issue raised in the answer shall be considered. After the board of viewers shall have ordered the additional issue of bonds the further procedure as to the assessment rolls, the levy and collecting of drainage taxes, the disbursement of the revenue therefrom for the payment the bonds and interest thereon, and all future procedure shall be the same as required by the preceding sections of this chapter, and amendments thereto, for the establishment of drainage projects.

       Any engineer employed under the provisions of this chapter shall receive such compensation as is commensurate with the relative area and importance of the proposed project. The amount when decided upon by the judge of the court, after conferring with the engineer, shall be entered as an order of record in the drainage record. The viewers, other than the engineer, shall receive five dollars per day each. The transitmen, rodmen, chainmen, axemen, and other laborers shall receive wages not to exceed the wages current at the time in the locality for such services. The members of the board of viewers shall receive, from time to time, out of the respective drainage project funds, such compensation as the court shall determine to be reasonable for the time expended and services performed by them on each project. All other fees and costs incurred under the provisions of this chapter shall be the same, as provided by law for like services in other cases, or as fixed by the court if not provided by law. The costs and expenses shall be paid by order of the court out of the proper project drainage fund provided for that purpose, and the board of viewers shall issue warrants therefor when funds of a drainage project, for which service shall have been rendered, shall be in the hands of the treasurer or treasurers.

     Constitutionality of chapter.
    </b>
    - Statutes of the same general character as the drainage laws, embodied in this chapter, have been in force in many of the states for a long time and their constitutionality is too well settled to admit of serious doubt. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 492</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 644</cite> (1917), overruled on other grounds Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975), holding that the constitutional question could not be considered when raised for the first time on appeal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary question of the public use and necessity of drainage rights in general has been determined by the legislature, and this will be controlling with the courts, in the absence of something to show a palpable want of foundation for the legislative pronouncement. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 492</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 644</cite> (1917), overruled on other grounds Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Application of this section is unconstitutional where
    </b>
    the trial court, under the authority of this section, found taking "proper," the effect being to decree that private property be taken for private use. Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was an attempt to develop a tract for private gain which was the genesis and basis for condemnation of easement across private land, any incidental public benefit was ancillary to and collateral to the underlying and primary purpose of the taking. That purpose was for the improvement of one's land at his neighbor's expense, and for the establishment of a prosperous private enterprise by the former to the detriment of the latter. Such a taking is not for a public use within constitutional limitations, and amounts to an unconstitutional application of this section. Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Salient consideration in analyzing constitutionality of this section
    </b>
    is not whether a public benefit results from condemnation, but whether a public use is predominant. Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).
    <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     The statute prescribes no special form of procedure,
    </b>
    and its terms are very general. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 492</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 644</cite> (1917), overruled on other grounds Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).

       <p>
        <b>
     And the right of drainage depends upon the facts of each case.
    </b>
    - The statute leaves it for the court to determine in each case whether it is proper to grant the right. And in a proceeding under the statute, where none of the evidence is certified on writ of error by defendant, it will be presumed that a proper case was made out. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 493</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 644</cite> (1917), overruled on other grounds Phillips v.

        <b>
     "Public use" implies
    </b>
    a possession, occupation and enjoyment of the land by the public at large, or by public agencies. A due protection to the rights of private property will preclude the government from seizing it in the hands of the owner, and turning it over to another on vague grounds of public benefit to spring from the more profitable use to which the latter may devote it. Phillips v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">215 Va. 543</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 93 (1975).

     Mode of drainage proposed by applicant.
    </b>
    - There is no requirement that the applicant should specify in his application the mode of drainage proposed by him. It is sufficient that this mode be made to appear in some satisfactory way to the defendant landowner and to the commissioners, so that the latter may hear both parties, obtain full information, and report intelligently to the court with regard to the matter. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, <cite class="va_code">120 Va. 492</cite>, 91 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 644</cite> (1917), overruled on other grounds Phillips v.

     May be changed by commissioners.
    </b>
    - In a proceeding under this chapter the commissioners reported and the court approved a different location for the drain from that asked for in the original petition. There is nothing in the statute to indicate a purpose to confine the applicant to the mode of drainage originally contemplated or proposed by him if he is willing to accept another which the commissioners and the court deem proper. The new or modified mode then becomes the mode "proposed by the applicant" within the meaning of
