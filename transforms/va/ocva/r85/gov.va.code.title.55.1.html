      <p>
       Any alien, not an enemy, may acquire by purchase or descent and hold real estate in the Commonwealth, and such real estate shall be transmitted in the same manner as real estate held by citizens. However, if, at the time of the transfer, a court of the Commonwealth determines that the laws of a foreign country or sovereignty effectively deny a Virginia resident, legatee, or distributee the benefit, use, or control of money or other property held in such foreign country or sovereignty, a judgment or order issued in the Commonwealth concerning the rights of a resident of that foreign country or sovereignty to the benefit, use, or control of money or property held in the Commonwealth may direct that the money or property be paid into the court for the benefit of the alien. The money or property paid into court shall be paid out only upon order of the court or pursuant to the order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Any of the money or property remaining with the court upon expiration of three years from the decedent's death shall be paid out by the court as if the alien had predeceased the decedent.

         Common-law seal requirement antedated the General Assembly's existence, and the legislative antecedent to the Statute of Conveyances made its first appearance in the Code of Virginia in 1705; so, even if Chapter 4 of Title 55 never existed, the seal requirement would nevertheless govern deeds of lease with a term exceeding five years. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, <cite class="va_code">295 Va. 396</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018).

         By its plain terms, the saving statute only saves deeds that fail to take effect by virtue of this chapter, and this saving statute appears in Chapter 4 of Title 55, but nowhere in that chapter is there a statutory requirement that deeds be under seal; that requirement comes from the common law and is incorporated into the definition of "deed" in the Statute of Conveyances, neither of which can be found in Chapter 4 of Title 55.

     Effect of statute.
    </b>
    - Prior to May 1, 1888, the date upon which the Code of 1887 took effect, a parol gift or a promise of a gift of land, to be consummated by deed, if followed by possession and improvements of the land, was enforceable under the doctrine of such cases as Halsey v. Peters' Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">79 Va. 60</cite> (1884); and a contract for a gift to be perfected by will, under similar circumstances, was enforceable under the doctrine announced in Burdine v. Burdine's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">98 Va. 515</cite>, 36 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 992</cite>, 81 Am. St. R. 741 (1900). But in view of the history and apparent purpose of this section, which first made its appearance in the Code of 1887, no such contract or gift is now enforceable. Wohlford v. Wohlford, <cite class="va_code">121 Va. 699</cite>, 93 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 629</cite> (1917). See Nicholas v. Nicholas, <cite class="va_code">100 Va. 660</cite>, 42 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 669</cite>, rehearing denied, <cite class="va_code">100 Va. 665</cite>, 42 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 866</cite> (1902); Brooks v.

        </p>
        <p>
         At common law voluntary parol partition of lands between coparceners was valid without deed. Not until
    
     §
    
    2413 of the Code of 1887 became effective on May 1, 1888, was a deed required to effect such partition. Rowe v. Big Sandy Coal Corp., <cite class="va_code">197 Va. 136</cite>, 87 S.E.2d 763 (1955).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was contended on behalf of the appellant that this section had no application, because the alleged contract was based upon a valuable consideration, to wit: the complainant's change of position by leaving his own farm and bestowing his labor and care upon that of another, and the sale of his own land and application of the proceeds to improvements upon the place with reference to which he had a parol contract. But in this respect, the case cannot be distinguished in principle from Halsey v. Peter's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">79 Va. 60</cite> (1884), the doctrine of which and the other Virginia cases of that type this section was expressly designed to abolish. Wohlford v. Wohlford, <cite class="va_code">121 Va. 699</cite>, 93 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 629</cite> (1917).
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the adoption of this section, an oral promise to give or devise land, followed by possession and improvements, was sufficient to support a right to a conveyance of the same from the heirs or devisees of the donor, but since the adoption of this section such a promise must be in writing before it can be enforced.

    In the instant case complainant, who was asserting a gift of land from his father to him, has his evidence in writing and although this writing was crudely drawn it was quite clear that the father intended to give a tract of land to the son in consideration of the maintenance of the father and his wife.

    - The words "goods or chattels" used in this section, relating to gifts, do not apply to choses in action, but only to visible and tangible property. A chose in action is the money, damages or thing owing; the bond or note, etc., is but the evidence of it. Bank stock is a chose in action. First Nat'l Bank v.

    - For purposes of this section, the Supreme Court would adopt the following definition of "paraphernalia" found in the Oxford English Dictionary (1971): "personal belongings, esp., articles of adornment or attire, trappings; also the articles that compose an apparatus, outfit or equipment; . . . appointments or appurtenances in general."

     Requirements for gift are intention and actual or constructive delivery.
    </b>
    - In order for a gift inter vivos to be effective there must be an intention in praesenti on the part of the donor to make the gift and there must be such actual or constructive delivery as divests the donor of all dominion and control over the property and invests it in donee. Taylor v. Smith, <cite class="va_code">199 Va. 871</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 160 (1958).

        <p>
         In Virginia, in order for there to be a valid gift of personal property, it must be shown that there existed a present intention on the part of the donor to make a gift, coupled with a delivery, either actual or constructive, such as to divest the donor of all dominion and control over the property and place it in the donee. In addition to the common-law requirements of a valid gift, this section requires a deed or will, unless actual possession comes to and remains with the donee or some person claiming under him.

         To render a gift effectual, the thing given, or the means of obtaining it, must be delivered by the donor to the donee, or to his agent, and accepted by him. Yancey v. Field, <cite class="va_code">85 Va. 756</cite>, 8 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 721</cite> (1889).

     Delivery vesting equitable title is all that is necessary.

     Sale to wife and resale to husband.
    </b>
    - A husband, a merchant, conveyed to his wife a stock of goods which she immediately resold to him. There was no valuable consideration for either transfer. After these transfers the husband became indebted to complainant for purchases of merchandise in the ordinary course of business. These purchases from complainant by the husband were made in his own name and solely on his own credit. The husband at the time of the sale to his wife and resale, and thereafter, continued in actual possession of the stock of goods. It was held that neither this section nor former
    
     §
    
    55-83 in any way affected the title which the husband took under the contract of resale, and that the sale and resale between husband and wife did not make the wife a debtor as to purchases from complainant made by her husband. Canada v. C.H. Beasley &amp; Bros., <cite class="va_code">132 Va. 166</cite>, 111 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 251</cite> (1922), overruled in part by Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry.

    - Where husband testified that he gave his wife jewelry valued at $5,000 during the course of the marriage, the commissioner omitted the jewelry completely from the property that was valued for purposes of making an equitable distribution award, and the wife argued that the jewelry should have been excluded because it was "personal paraphernalia" and, thus, was exempt as a gift under this section, the court rejected the wife's argument and classified the jewelry as marital property.

     When a donee claims title to personal property in a gift inter vivos, the burden of proof rests upon him

    - There is no statute in Virginia that deprives a convict of the power to make contracts or conveyances of his real estate, and corruption of blood and forfeiture of estate on conviction of felony as at common law has been expressly abolished by this section.

         Although
    
     §
    
    55-2 was inapplicable to the conveyance of easements because an easement was not an estate, the circuit court's judgment was reversed; the deeds at issue, along with a plat incorporated therein for descriptive purposes, did not contain operative words manifesting an intention to grant an easement. Considering the particular circumstances of the two deeds and the plat at issue, and resolving any doubt against the establishment of an easement, there was no conveyance of an express easement across the property owner's two parcels for the benefit of the limited liability company's parcel.

    - Virginia Conservation Easement Act [
    
     §§
    
    10.1-1009 through 10.1-1016] did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic preservation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes.

     Executory interests.
    </b>
    - An executory devise stands upon precisely the same footing as contingent remainders insofar as transmissibility of the subject thereof is concerned, and an interest in such subject may be conveyed (certainly by virtue of such a statute as this section) prior to the happening of the contingency upon which the interest is appointed by the will to vest in right of possession, provided the grantor has at the time of conveyance a possibility of taking coupled with an interest. This he has, according to the authorities, if he, at such time, is an ascertained person to take under the devise. And he is such an ascertained person if he is designated by name or by class, all of which class are to take, and one of which he is. Medley v. Medley, <cite class="va_code">81 Va. 265</cite> (1886); Prince v. Barham, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 462</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 626</cite> (1920).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a possible taker under an executory devise is designated by class, and he should die before the testator, if the will speaks as of that time in designating the person to take, the survivors of the class will take; but if he survives such time, his interest, under an executory devise, equally as if it were a contingent remainder, is descendible, and assignable in equity, and also at law, certainly by virtue of this statute in Virginia. Many of the authorities hold that the same is true at common law since the statute of uses and of wills dispenses with livery of seisin. Prince v. Barham, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 462</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 626</cite> (1920).

     Right to construct sewer.
    </b>
    - A deed conveying part of a tract of land (consisting of 47.5 acres) provided that the grantee should have a right to construct a sewer through the property of the grantor. The deed contemplated the use of the easement not only for the drainage of the 47.5 acres conveyed, but also as essential to the drainage of an incorporated town, and other lands not included in that particular tract. It was held that the easement was not appurtenant to the 47.5 acres conveyed by the deed. It was either an easement in gross, or else extends the area of the land to which it is appurtenant, so as, at least, to include land naturally drained by the channel. If it is to be regarded as an easement in gross, it is still "an interest in land," and, therefore, may be disposed of by deed or will under this section. City of Richmond v.

         The rule of
         May v. Joynes,
         61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871) held that a life estate coupled with the absolute power of disposition created a fee simple estate invalidating the remainder; this rule obviously could defeat a testator's intent, and, therefore, a statute was enacted to validate the remainder to the extent that the life tenant had not disposed of it.

         The amendment of 1908 applied to "any estate," whether for life or in fee, and permitted a valid remainder, even after a fee, if power of disposition, where granted, was not exercised and there remained anything after the death of the devisee.

        <p>
         This was so unsatisfactory to the Code revisors of 1919 that they changed the amendment and limited the remainder over to cases where there was only an express estate for life. Therefore, subsequent to the revision of 1919, except where there is an express estate for life, the remainder is void just as it was prior to the amendment of 1908. Moore v.

     May v. Joynes,
    
    61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871), which holds that whenever in any devise or conveyance a life estate is given and there is afterwards given to the life tenant or first taker power to dispose of or consume the corpus of the estate, the first taker is vested with a fee simple estate, has been abolished, and the estate of the remaindermen preserved. The section is remedial and should be liberally construed. Christian v.

         - The act passed in 1785 (the original of this section) dispensed with the necessity of words of inheritance or perpetuity to create an estate of inheritance. Goodrich v. Harding, 24 Va.

    - The grantee, in a deed for land conveyed without any words of limitation, usually succeeds to every right of his grantor therein, or, as expressed in this section, such a deed passes the fee simple or whole estate or interest which the grantor had power to dispose of, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the conveyance.

    - Since under this statute the whole deed is to be looked to in order to ascertain the intention of the parties, the common-law rule that the habendum clause of a deed must yield to the granting clause in case of repugnance between the two no longer applies where the intention of the grantor can be ascertained with reasonable certainty.

    </b>
    - Residuary clause in a testator's will unambiguously granted the testator's wife a life estate in the residual property. Along with directing the disposition of the residual property following the wife's death, the residuary clause placed limitations on the wife's use of the property during her life, and these limitations were irreconcilable with an absolute power of disposition.

     History of section abolishing estates tail.
    </b>
    - The acts of 1776 and 1785 abolished entails and converted estates tail into fee simple estates. See Carter v. Tyler, 5 Va. (1 Call) 165 (1797); Tate v. Tally, 7 Va. (3 Call) 354 (1802); Smith v. Chapman, 11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 240 (1807); Bells v. Gillespie, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 273 (1827); Broaddus v. Turner, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 308 (1827); Ball v. Payne, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 73 (1827); Jiggetts v. Davis, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 368 (1829); Orndoff v. Turman, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 200 (1830); Seekright on Demise of Bramble v. Billups, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 90 (1833); Doe on Demise of Thomason v. Andersons, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 118 (1833); Doe on Demise of See v. Craigen, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 449 (1836); Nowlin v. Winfree, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 346 (1852); East v. Garrett, <cite class="va_code">84 Va. 523</cite>, 9 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 1112</cite> (1888); Hawthorne v. Beckwith, <cite class="va_code">89 Va. 786</cite>, 17 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 241</cite> (1893); Walker v. Lewis, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 578</cite>, 19 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 258</cite> (1894).
        </p>
        <p>
         The act of 1776 operated upon all estates tail in possession, and those in reversion or remainder, after the determination of an estate for life, or lives, or of any lesser estate; but a greater estate than for life or lives, was not within the operation of the act. An estate tail in remainder, after the determination of a preceding estate tail, e.g., was not affected by the act. Roy v. Garnett, 2 Va. (2 Wash.) 9 (1794). Hence, the statute of 1785, abolishing all entails, was reenacted from the statute of 1776, which had failed to accomplish its avowed purpose. Bells v. Gillespie, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 273 (1827).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was held that by the act of 1776, for docking entails, all remainders, contingent as well as vested, were utterly barred, whether the entail was created before or after passage of the act. Hence, a devise of lands to A. and if the said A. should die not having any lawful heir of his body, then the land to go to B., created an estate tail in A., which by the statute was converted into a fee simple, and the limitation over was void. Carter v. Tyler, 5 Va. (1 Call) 165 (1797). See Hunter v. Haynes' Lessee, 1 Va. (1 Wash.) 71 (1792); Hill v. Burrow, 7 Va. (3 Call) 342 (1802); Tate v. Tally, 7 Va. (3 Call) 354 (1802); Eldridge v. Fisher, 11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 559 (1807); Sydnor v. Sydnors, 16 Va. (2 Munf.) 263 (1811); M'Clintic v. Manns, 18 Va. (4 Munf.) 328 (1814); Tidball v. Lupton, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 194 (1822); Kendall v. Eyre, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 288 (1823); Bells v. Gillespie, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 273 (1827); Broaddus v. Turner, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 308 (1827); Jiggetts v. Davis, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 368 (1829); Doe on Demise of See v. Craigen, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 449 (1836); Callis v. Kemp, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 78 (1854); Tinsley v. Jones, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 289 (1856); Hood v. Haden, <cite class="va_code">82 Va. 588</cite> (1886). But this doctrine of Carter v. Tyler, 5 Va. (1 Call) 165 (1797), was abrogated after January 1, 1820 by the provision of this section that "every limitation upon such estate shall be held valid if the same would be valid when limited upon an estate in fee simple created by technical language."

          Statute liberally construed.
         </b>
         - The statute abolishing entails is a highly remedial statute and should be liberally construed. Orndoff v. Turman, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 200 (1830).

         <b>
     Presumption against intention to create entailed estate.
    </b>
    - Since the act of 1776 abolishing entails, it is not to be supposed that a man intended to convey an estate tail unless plain and unequivocal words were used, such as would of themselves create a fee tail without resorting to implication. Walker v. Lewis, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 578</cite>, 19 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 258</cite> (1894). See Smith v. Chapman, 11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 240 (1807); Taylor v. Cleary, 70 Va.

     Statement of the rule in Shelley's Case.
    </b>
    - Whenever the ancestor, by any will, gift, or conveyance, takes an estate of freehold in lands, or tenements, and in the same will, gift, or conveyance, an estate is afterwards limited by way of remainder, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs, or to the heirs of his body, the words "heirs," or "heirs of the body," are words of limitation of the estate, carrying the inheritance to the ancestor, and not words of purchase creating a contingent remainder in the heirs. Moore v. Brooks, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 135 (1855); Taylor v. Cleary, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 448 (1877); King v.

     History and effect of statute.
    </b>
    - Code 1849, c. 146,
    
     §
    
    11, essaying to abolish the rule in Shelley's Case, applied only where the grantor or testator was competent to, and did vest in the heir a remainder in fee simple after an estate for the ancestor's life. Hood v. Haden, <cite class="va_code">82 Va. 588</cite> (1886). This is not true under the present statute, which is coordinate with the rule itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         The parties of the first part in a deed granted property to the party of the second part: "To have and to hold unto the party of the second part for her lifetime and then to her heirs forever." It was held that under this section the language used gave to the grantee an estate for life and to her children a remainder in fee. Puckett v. Campbell, <cite class="va_code">151 Va. 213</cite>, 144 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 434</cite> (1928).

         <b>
     Rule of property; not of construction.
    </b>
    - The rule in Shelley's Case, where the requisites concur, controls the intention of the testator, or grantor, and overrides his purpose, often very clearly expressed, to limit the ancestor to an estate of freehold. The rule is not a means to discover the intent of the grantor, or testator, but, supposing the intent ascertained, the rule controls it. Taylor v. Cleary, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 448 (1877); Turner v. Monteiro, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 537</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 572</cite> (1920). See Walker v. Lewis, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 578</cite>, 19 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 258</cite> (1894).

     Words must be used to import class of persons to take indefinitely in succession.
    </b>
    - It is a part of the rule in Shelley's Case and essential to its operation, that the words used to indicate the persons to whom the estate is limited, by way of remainder, must import a class of persons to take indefinitely in succession. If they do import such a class, then the rule is of inflexible application; but if the words are used to designate particular individuals, the words so used are words of purchase and not of limitation,
    
     e.g.
    
    , grant to A. for life, remainder to the heirs of A. now living, or remainder to the sons of A. and their heirs, or remainder to the children of A. In all of these instances, particular individuals are indicated by the words used; hence, the rule does not apply. Turner v. Monteiro, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 537</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 572</cite> (1920).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     "Descendants" and "heirs of the body" are of equivalent meaning.
    </b>
    - The rule in Shelley's Case applies when the limitation in remainder is to the "heirs of the body" of the tenant of the freehold. The words "descendants" and "heirs of the body" are of equivalent meaning. Turner v. Monteiro, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 537</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 572</cite> (1920).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Who are "descendants."
    </b>
    - While the word "descendants" is not a technical word to the extent that the law has not impressed it with a different meaning from that accorded in common acceptation and general understanding, it is a word much used in law and of very clear and definite meaning. A descendant is an individual proceeding from an ancestor in any degree. It is synonymous with issue. It is offspring, near or remote. The word "child" is not synonymous with the word "descendant," though a child is a descendant and a descendant may be a child; but a descendant may also proceed from an ancestor in the remotest as well as the nearest degree. Obviously, this is not true as to a child. Turner v. Monteiro, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 537</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 572</cite> (1920).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Application of rule.
    </b>
    - Under a will which took effect before the abolition of the rule in Shelley's Case, a testator gave land to two of his sons during their lifetime to hold jointly and after the death of the last of the two to their descendants, if they have any; if not, to a third party or his descendants. Held, that by force of this rule in Shelley's Case the two sons took an estate tail, which, by operation of the statute, then as now in force, was converted into a joint fee. Turner v. Monteiro, <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 537</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 572</cite> (1920).
        </p>
        <p>
         The court held that where a testator gave his estate to his wife during her life, and at her death to be equally divided amongst all of his children and the shares of his two daughters to be held by them during their natural lives and no longer, and then equally to be divided between their heirs lawfully begotten, the words "heirs lawfully to be begotten" (or similar words) were words of limitation and the daughters took the whole interest in their shares of the estate. Moore v. Brooks, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 135 (1855). See Tinsley v. Jones, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 289 (1856); Hall's Ex'r v. Smith, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 70 (1874); Walker v. Lewis, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 578</cite>, 19 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 258</cite> (1894).

          Rule not applicable.
         </b>
         - The court held that a grant by D. to his grandson R., his executors, administrators and assigns, from and after the grantor's death, for and during his life only; and after his death the said piece of land to go to such person or persons as shall at that time answer the description of heir or heirs at law of the said R., and such person or persons shall take the said land under that description as purchasers under and by virtue of this deed, and not by inheritance as heirs of the said R., created in R. but a life estate in the land; and the persons who at the time of R.'s death answered the description of his heirs at law took as purchasers under the deed.

       No trust relating to real estate shall fail nor shall any use relating to real estate be defeated because no beneficiaries are specified by name in the recorded deed of conveyance to the trustee or because no duties are imposed upon the trustee. The power conferred by any such instrument on a trustee to sell, lease, encumber, or otherwise dispose of property described in such instrument shall be effective, and no person dealing with such a trustee shall be required to make further inquiry as to the right of such trustee to act, nor shall he be required to inquire as to the disposition of any proceeds.

       In any case under this section where there is a recorded deed of conveyance to a trustee, the interest of the beneficiaries thereunder shall be deemed to be personal property. Judgments against a beneficiary and consensual liens against real property of a beneficiary do not attach to real property that is the subject of such a deed of conveyance unless the judgment is docketed or the lien recorded in the county or city where the property is located (i) before recordation of the deed creating the land trust and (ii) while the beneficiary has record title to the real property.

      <p>
       In any case under this section where there is a recorded deed of conveyance to a trustee and the trustee named in the deed declines to serve, resigns, is disqualified or removed, or is adjudicated incapacitated and there is (a) no successor trustee named in the deed, (b) no successor trustee designated by the terms of the trust instrument, or (c) no procedure set forth in the deed or trust instrument to designate a successor trustee, the beneficiaries of the trust, by majority decision, shall name a successor trustee. However, if the identities of the beneficiaries of the trust cannot be identified from the recorded deed of conveyance or a majority of the beneficiaries are unable to agree upon a successor trustee, the circuit court of the county or city in which the deed was recorded, upon the motion of any party interested in the administration of the trust, shall appoint a successor trustee whenever the court considers the appointment necessary for the administration of the trust. The name and address of any successor trustee so named or appointed shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city in which the deed was recorded, and such successor trustee shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and privileges, and shall be subject to all the duties, liabilities, and responsibilities imposed upon, the original trustee unless the deed of conveyance expressly provides to the contrary.

      <p>
       Nothing in this section shall be construed to (1) affect any right that a creditor may otherwise have against a trustee or beneficiary except as provided in this section, (2) enlarge upon the power of a corporation to act as trustee under <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.06.2.html#t6.2sIIc10a01s6.2-1001" target="_blank">§ 6.2-1001</a></cite>, or (3) affect the rule against perpetuities.

     Trustee in a land trust receives both legal and equitable title.
    </b>
    - Unlike a creditor trust where legal title resides in the trustee while the beneficiary retains equitable title, the trustee in a land trust receives both legal and equitable title to the property. Air Power, Inc. v. Thompson, <cite class="va_code">244 Va. 534</cite>, 422 S.E.2d 768 (1992).

     Beneficiary receives no interest in property in a land trust.

     Third party has no responsibility to notify beneficiary of action against property.

    - The provisions of this section effectively eliminate a third party's responsibility, and ability, to notify land trust beneficiaries of any action against the property which that party may contemplate. Air Power, Inc. v. Thompson, <cite class="va_code">244 Va. 534</cite>, 422 S.E.2d 768 (1992).

     Beneficiary was proper but not necessary party in mechanics lien action.

     Status of land trust.
    </b>
    - Where the facts in the record were insufficient to support a finding that an entity other than a land trust was actually created, and the trust agreement specifically provided that it would not be deemed to create or evidence the existence of a corporation, association, joint venture, or partnership, a land trust created under this section was not some type of business organization.

     "Deemed to be personal property" provision ineffectual to extent noteholder's rights affected.

    - To the extent that a "deemed to be personal property" provision in a land trust agreement would affect the noteholder's right to invoke the due-on-sale clause in a deed of trust against the beneficiary thereunder, the provision is ineffectual.

     Remedy provided is cumulative.
    </b>
    - The instant case was a suit against vendees who had assumed the payment of a mortgage. Defendants demurred on the ground that the complainant had a complete and adequate remedy at law under this section. Upon the question of whether under this section the complainant might sue the defendants at law on their assumption of the mortgage debt due complainant, the Supreme Court expressed no opinion. However, the statutory remedy by an action at law under this section is cumulative only in such cases, and does not oust courts of chancery from the jurisdiction they have long exercised to grant relief to a mortgage creditor against the grantee of mortgaged property who has assumed the mortgage debt, under the doctrine of subrogation.

          Mortgagee has no direct action at law against second mortgagor.
         </b>
         - The mortgagee's right to hold a subsequent purchaser liable is not grounded in contract between the mortgagee and the subsequent purchaser, as generally no such contract exists, but on the theory that the covenant of the subsequent purchaser is a collateral security obtained by the mortgagor, which by equitable subrogation inures to the benefit of the mortgagee. Thus, as between the original mortgagor and the subsequent purchaser, the latter is the principal debtor and the mortgagor is his surety. The promise of a subsequent purchaser to assume the mortgage debt upon the property is a contract only between the two of them absent an independent undertaking by the purchaser and the mortgagee. Admittedly, the contract benefits the mortgagee but the primary beneficiary of this collateral undertaking is the mortgagor. Therefore, absent some statutory authority, no direct action at law (as distinguished from equity) by the mortgagee against the second mortgagor will lie. If upon foreclosure the property does not bring enough to satisfy the entire debt, the mortgage creditor may proceed in an equity court against the subsequent purchaser for any deficiency.

     Settlement of disputes as to title and boundaries.

          Judgment lien did not constitute good title to property.
         </b>
         - Judgment creditor's action for quiet title failed because the creditor's claim of superior title failed because the creditor's judgment lien did not constitute good title to the property, and the creditor cited absolutely no support for the proposition that its claimed interest in the form of a judgment lien that had attached to the property was itself a title to the estate.

    - The fact that complainants owned the fee simple title to a tract of land and the mineral rights in an adjacent tract did not deprive them of the right to have the established boundary lines of the adjacent tract fixed and determined by a court of equity, even though, as owners of the fee in the first-mentioned tract, they might have proceeded under

     Determination of title as between hostile claims.
    </b>
    - A court of equity is without jurisdiction in a suit to remove a cloud upon title to determine the question of title as between several independent, distinct and hostile claims. Such an independent and hostile claim, involving the whole property and denying in toto and ab initio the title of the complainants, cannot be set up and adjudicated in a suit in equity. To permit this would authorize an adverse claimant to implead other claimants of the title in such a way as to substitute an equity suit for an action of ejectment. Duty v. Honaker Lumber Co., <cite class="va_code">131 Va. 31</cite>, 108 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 863</cite> (1921).

     Forfeiture for breach of condition not within section.
    </b>
    - A suit in equity to annul and rescind a deed for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be treated as a suit to remove a cloud from title where the complainant has neither legal nor equitable title, and therefore does not fall within the class of persons who may bring a suit to quiet title under this section. Until the consummation of the forfeiture, the grantor in a case like this has nothing but a right of action. Pence v. Tidewater Townsite Corp., <cite class="va_code">127 Va. 447</cite>, 103 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 694</cite> (1920).

     Relief against fraud and enforcement of trusts.
    </b>
    - It was never intended, either by this section, or by the cases which have construed it, to deny to a court of equity jurisdiction either to relieve against fraud or to declare and enforce trusts resulting therefrom. Bath Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Back Creek Mt. Corp., <cite class="va_code">140 Va. 280</cite>, 125 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 213</cite> (1924).

         In a suit to remove clouds upon title and to establish a resulting trust, equity had jurisdiction and it was not harmful to deny a jury trial. Bath Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Back Creek Mt. Corp., <cite class="va_code">140 Va. 280</cite>, 125 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 213</cite> (1924).

     Amendment of bill.
    </b>
    - In a suit involving title to a tract of land, the original bill sought to have a grant from the Commonwealth to appellants cancelled but after the court decided that appellee had failed to prove that the grant had been procured through fraud, the bill was amended so as to pray to have the deed to appellants removed as a cloud upon appellee's title. It was held that the procedure adopted by the trial court conformed to the provisions of this section. French v.

         Common-Law Rule Against Perpetuities Superseded.
        </b>
        As provided in Section 9, this Act supersedes the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (Common-law Rule) in jurisdictions previously adhering to it (or repeals any statutory version or variation thereof previously in effect in the jurisdiction). The Common-law Rule (or the statutory version or variation thereof) is replaced by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule) set forth in this section and by the other provisions in this Act.

         Subsidiary Doctrines Continue in Force Except to the Extent the Provisions of Act Conflict with Them.
        </b>
        The courts in interpreting the Common-law Rule developed several subsidiary doctrines. In accordance with the general principle of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be construed narrowly, a subsidiary doctrine is superseded by this Act only to the extent the provisions of the Act conflict with it. A listing and discussion of such subsidiary doctrines, such as the constructional preference for validity, the all-or-nothing rule for class gifts, and the doctrine of infectious invalidity, appears later, in Part G of this Comment.

         Application.

        Unless excluded by Section 4, the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule) applies to nonvested property interests and to powers of appointment over property or property interests that are nongeneral powers, general testamentary powers, or general powers not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Statutory Rule does not apply to vested property interests (e.g., X's interest in Example (23) of this Comment) or to presently exercisable general powers of appointment (e.g., G's power in Example (19) of this Comment; G's power in Example (1) in the Comment to Section 2; A's power in Example (2) in the Comment to Section 2; X's power in Example (3) in the Comment to Section 2; A's noncumulative power of withdrawal in Example (4) in the Comment to Section 2).

          The Common-law Rule's Validating and Invalidating Sides.
         </b>
         The Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is a rule of
         <b>
          initial
         </b>
         validity or invalidity. At common law, a nonvested property interest is either valid or invalid
         <b>
          as of its creation.
         </b>
         Like most rules of property law, the Common-law Rule has both a validating and an invalidating side. Both sides are derived from John Chipman Gray's formulation of the Common-law Rule:
        </p>
        <p>
         No [nonvested property] interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         J. Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities
         §
         201 (4th ed. 1942). From this formulation, the validating and invalidating sides of the Common-law Rule are derived as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Validating Side of the Common-law Rule.
         </b>
         A nonvested property interest is valid when it is created (initially valid) if it is then
         <b>
          certain
         </b>
         to vest or terminate (fail to vest) - one or the other - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Invalidating Side of the Common-law Rule.
         </b>
         A nonvested property interest is invalid when it is created (initially invalid) if there is no such certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notice that the invalidating side focuses on a lack of
         <b>
          certainty,
         </b>
         which means that invalidity under the Common-law Rule is
         <b>
          not
         </b>
         dependent on
         <b>
          actual
         </b>
         post-creation events but only on
         <b>
          possible
         </b>
         post-creation events.
         <b>
          Actual
         </b>
         post-creation events are irrelevant, even those that are known at the time of the lawsuit. It is generally recognized that the
         <b>
          invalidating
         </b>
         side of the Common-law Rule is harsh because it can invalidate interests on the ground of possible post-creation events that are extremely unlikely to happen and that in actuality almost never do happen, if ever.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          The Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.
         </b>
         The essential difference between the Common-law Rule and its statutory replacement is that the Statutory Rule preserves the Common-law Rule's overall policy of preventing property from being tied up in unreasonably long or even perpetual family trusts or other property arrangements, while eliminating the harsh potential of the Common-law Rule. The Statutory Rule achieves this result by codifying (in slightly revised form) the validating side of the Common-law Rule and modifying the invalidating side by adopting a wait-and-see element. Under the Statutory Rule, interests that would have been initially valid at common law continue to be initially valid, but interests that would have been initially invalid at common law are invalid only if they do not actually vest or terminate within the permissible vesting period set forth in Section 1(a)(2). Thus, the Uniform Act recasts the validating and invalidating sides of the Rule Against Perpetuities as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Validating Side of the Statutory Rule:
         </b>
         A nonvested property interest is initially valid if, when it is created, it is then
         <b>
          certain
         </b>
         to vest or terminate (fail to vest) - one or the other - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive. The validity of a nonvested property interest that is not
         <b>
          initially
         </b>
         valid is in abeyance. Such an interest is valid if it vests within the permissible vesting period after its creation.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Invalidating Side of the Statutory Rule:
         </b>
         A nonvested property interest that is not
         <b>
          initially
         </b>
         valid becomes invalid (and subject to reformation under Section 3) if it neither vests nor terminates within the permissible vesting period after its creation.
        </p>
        <p>
         As indicated, this modification of the invalidating side of the Common-law Rule is generally known as the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform. The wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform was approved by the American Law Institute as part of the Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

        B. SECTION 1(a)(1): NONVESTED PROPERTY INTERESTS THAT ARE INITIALLY VALID
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Nonvested Property Interest.
        </b>
        Section 1(a) sets forth the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities with respect to nonvested property interests. A nonvested property interest (also called a contingent property interest) is a future interest in property that is subject to an unsatisfied condition precedent. In the case of a class gift, the interests of all the unborn members of the class are nonvested because they are subject to the unsatisfied condition precedent of being born. At common law, the interests of all potential class members must be valid or the class gift is invalid. As pointed out in more detail later in this Comment, this so-called all-or-nothing rule with respect to class gifts is not superseded by this Act, and so remains in effect under the Statutory Rule. Consequently, all class gifts that are subject to open are to be regarded as nonvested property interests for the purposes of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Section 1(a)(1) Codifies the Validating Side of the Common-law Rule.
        </b>
        The validating side of the Common-law Rule is codified in Section 1(a)(1) (and, with respect to powers of appointment, in Sections 1(b)(1) and 1(c)(1)).
       </p>
       <p>
        A nonvested property interest that satisfies the requirement of Section 1(a)(1) is initially valid. That is, it is valid as of the time of its creation. There is no need to subject such an interest to the waiting period set forth in Section 1(a)(2), nor would it be desirable to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        For a nonvested property interest to be valid as of the time of its creation under Section 1(a)(1), there must then be a
        <b>
         certainty
        </b>
        that the interest will either vest or terminate - an interest terminates when vesting becomes impossible - no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive. To satisfy this requirement, it must be established that there is no possible chain of events that might arise after the interest was created that would allow the interest to vest or terminate after the expiration of the 21-year period following the death of an individual in being at the creation of the interest. Consequently, initial validity under Section 1(a)(1) can be established only if there is an individual for whom there is a causal connection between the individual's death and the interest's vesting or terminating no later than 21 years thereafter.
        <b>
         The individual described in subsection (a)(1) (and subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) as well) is often referred to as the "validating life," the term used throughout the Comments to this Act.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Determining Whether There is a Validating Life.
        </b>
        The process for determining whether a validating life exists is to postulate the death of each individual connected in some way to the transaction, and ask the question: Is there with respect to this individual an invalidating chain of possible events? If one individual can be found for whom the answer is No, that individual can serve as the validating life. As to that individual there will be the requisite causal connection between his or her death and the questioned interest's vesting or terminating no later than 21 years thereafter.
       </p>
       <p>
        In searching for a validating life, only individuals who are connected in some way to the transaction need to be considered, for they are the only ones who have a chance of supplying the requisite causal connection. Such individuals vary from situation to situation, but typically include the beneficiaries of the disposition, including the taker or takers of the nonvested property interest, and individuals related to them by blood or adoption, especially in the ascending and descending lines. There is no point in even considering the life of an individual unconnected to the transaction - an individual from the world at large who happens to be in being at the creation of the interest. No such individual can be a validating life because there will be an invalidating chain of possible events as to every unconnected individual who might be proposed: Any such individual can immediately die after the creation of the nonvested property interest without causing any acceleration of the interest's vesting or termination. (The life expectancy of any unconnected individual, or even the probability that one of a number of new-born babies will live a long life, is irrelevant.)
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (1) - Parent of Devisees as the Validating Life.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, remainder to A's children who attain 21." G was survived by his son (A), by his daughter (B), by A's wife (W), and by A's two children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who reach 21 satisfies Section 1(a)(1)'s requirement, and the interest is initially valid. When the interest was created (at G's death), the interest was then certain to vest or terminate no later than 21 years after A's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        The process by which A is determined to be the validating life is one of testing various candidates to see if any of them have the requisite causal connection. As noted above, no one from the world at large can have the requisite causal connection, and so such individuals are disregarded. Once the inquiry is narrowed to the appropriate candidates, the first possible validating life that comes to mind is A, who does in fact fulfill the requirement: Since A's death cuts off the possibility of any more children being born to him, it is impossible, no matter when A dies, for any of A's children to be alive and under the age of 21 beyond 21 years after A's death. (See the discussion of subsection (d), below.)
       </p>
       <p>
        A is therefore the validating life for the nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who attain 21. None of the other individuals who is connected to this transaction could serve as the validating life because an invalidating chain of possible post-creation events exists as to each one of them. The other individuals who might be considered include W, X, Y, and B. In the case of W, an invalidating chain of events is that she might predecease A, A might remarry and have a child by his new wife, and such child might be alive and under the age of 21 beyond the 21-year period following W's death. With respect to X and Y, an invalidating chain of events is that they might predecease A, A might later have another child, and that child might be alive and under 21 beyond the 21-year period following the death of the survivor of X and Y. As to B, she suffers from the same invalidating chain of events as exists with respect to X and Y. The fact that none of these other individuals can serve as the validating life is of no consequence, however, because only one such individual is required for the validity of a nonvested interest to be established, and that individual is A.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         The Rule of Subsection (d).
        </b>
        The rule established in subsection (d) plays a significant role in the search for a validating life. Subsection (d) declares that the possibility that a child will be born to an individual after the individual's death is to be disregarded. It is important to note that this rule applies only for the purposes of determining the validity of an interest (or power of appointment) under paragraph (1) of subsection (a), (b), or (c). The rule of subsection (d) does not apply, for example, to questions such as whether or not a child who is born to an individual after the individual's death qualifies as a taker of a beneficial interest - as a member of a class or otherwise. Neither subsection (d), nor any other provision of this Act, supersedes the widely accepted common-law principle, sometimes codified, that a child in gestation (a child sometimes described as a child
        en ventre sa mere
        ) who is later born alive is regarded as alive at the commencement of gestation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The limited purpose of subsection (d) is to solve a perpetuity problem caused by advances in medical science. The problem is illustrated by a case such as Example (1), above - "to A for life, remainder to A's children who reach 21." When the Common-law Rule was developing, the possibility was recognized, strictly speaking, that one or more of A's children might reach 21 more than 21 years after A's death. The possibility existed because A's wife (who might not be a life in being) might be pregnant when A died. If she was, and if the child was born viable a few months after A's death, the child could not reach his or her 21st birthday within 21 years after A's death. The device then invented to validate the interest of A's children was to "extend" the allowable perpetuity period by tacking on a period of gestation, if needed. As a result, the common-law perpetuity period was comprised of three components: (1) a life in being (2) plus 21 years (3) plus a period of gestation, when needed. Today, thanks to sperm banks, frozen embryos, and even the possibility of artificially maintaining the body functions of deceased pregnant women long enough to develop the fetus to viability (see Detroit Free Press, July 31, 1986, at 5A; Ann Arbor News, Oct. 30, 1978, at C5 (AP story); N.Y. Times, Dec. 6, 1977, at 30; N.Y. Times, Dec. 2, 1977, at B16) - advances in medical science unanticipated when the Common-law Rule was in its developmental stages - having a pregnant wife at death is no longer the only way of having children after death. These medical developments, and undoubtedly others to come, make the mere addition of a period of gestation inadequate as a device to confer initial validity under Section 1(a)(1) on the interest of A's children in the above example. The rule of subsection (d), however,
        <b>
         does
        </b>
        insure the initial validity of the children's interest. Disregarding the possibility that children of A will be born after his death allows A to be the validating life. None of his children, under this assumption, can reach 21 more than 21 years after his death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that subsection (d) subsumes not only the case of children conceived after death, but also the more conventional case of children in gestation at death. With subsection (d) in place, the third component of the common-law perpetuity period is unnecessary and has been jettisoned. The perpetuity period recognized in paragraph (1) of subsections (a), (b), and (c) has only two components: (1) a life in being (2) plus 21 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        As to the legal status of conceived-after-death children, that question has not yet been resolved. For example, if in Example (1) it in fact turns out that A does leave sperm on deposit at a sperm bank and if in fact A's wife does become pregnant as a result of artificial insemination, the child or children produced thereby might not be included at all in the class gift. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) Introductory Note to Ch. 26 at pp.<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.02.html#t02c2-3" target="_blank"> 2-3</a></cite> (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1986). Without trying to predict how that matter will be settled in the future, the best way to handle the problem from the perpetuity perspective is subsection (d)'s rule requiring the possibility of post-death children to be disregarded.

        <b>
         Recipients as Their Own Validating Lives.
        </b>
        It is well established at common law that, in appropriate cases, the recipient of an interest can be his or her own validating life. See, e.g.,
        Rand v. Bank of California,
        236 Or. 619, 388 P.2d 437 (1964). Given the right circumstances, this principle can validate interests that are contingent on the recipient's reaching an age in excess of 21, or are contingent on the recipient's surviving a particular point in time that is or might turn out to be in excess of 21 years after the interest was created or after the death of a person in being at the date of creation.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (2) - Devisees as Their Own Validating Lives.
        </b>
        G devised real property "to A's children who attain 25." A predeceased G. At G's death, A had three living children, all of whom were under 25.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interest in favor of A's children who attain 25 is validated by Section 1(a)(1). Under subsection (d), the possibility that A will have a child born to him after his death (and since A predeceased G, after G's death) must be disregarded. Consequently, even if A's wife survived G, and even if she was pregnant at G's death or even if A had deposited sperm in a sperm bank prior to his death, it must be assumed that all of A's children are in being at G's death. A's children are, therefore, their own validating lives. (Note that subsection (d) requires that in determining whether an individual is a validating life, the possibility that a child will be born to "an" individual after the individual's death must be disregarded. The validating life and the individual whose having a post-death child is disregarded need not be the same individual.) Each one of A's children, all of whom under subsection (d) are regarded as alive at G's death, will either reach the age of 25 or fail to do so within his or her own lifetime. To say this another way, it is certain to be known no later than at the time of the death of each child whether or not that child survived to the required age.

         Validating Life Can Be Survivor of Group.
        </b>
        In appropriate cases, the validating life need not be individualized at first. Rather the validating life can initially (i.e., when the interest was created) be the unidentified survivor of a group of individuals. It is common in such cases to say that the members of the group are the validating
        <b>
         lives,
        </b>
        but the true meaning of the statement is that the validating
        <b>
         life
        </b>
        is the member of the group who turns out to live the longest. As the court said in
        Skatterwood v. Edge,
        1 Salk. 229, 91 Eng. Rep. 203 (K.B. 1697), "for let the lives be never so many, there must be a survivor, and so it is but the length of that life; for Twisden used to say, the candles were all lighted at once."

         Example (3) - Case of Validating Life Being the Survivor of a Group.
        </b>
        G devised real property "to such of my grandchildren as attain 21." Some of G's children are living at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interest in favor of G's grandchildren who attain 21 is valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is that one of G's children who turns out to live the longest. Since under subsection (d), it must be assumed that none of G's children will have post-death children, it is regarded as impossible for any of G's grandchildren to be alive and under 21 beyond the 21-year period following the death of G's last surviving child.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (4) - Sperm Bank Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the income to be paid to G's children for the life of the survivor, then to G's grandchildren for the life of the survivor, and on the death of G's last surviving grandchild, to pay the corpus to G's great-grandchildren then living. G's children all predeceased him, but several grandchildren were living at G's death. One of G's predeceased children (his son, A) had deposited sperm in a sperm bank. A's widow was living at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interest in favor of G's great-grandchildren is valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is the last surviving grandchild among the grandchildren living at G's death. Under subsection (d), the possibility that A will have a child conceived after G's death must be disregarded. Note that subsection (d) requires that in determining whether an individual is a validating life, the possibility that a child will be born to "an" individual after the individual's death is disregarded. The validating life and the individual whose having a post-death child is disregarded need not be the same individual. Thus in this example, by disregarding the possibility that
        <b>
         A
        </b>
        will have a conceived-after-death child, G's
        <b>
         last surviving grandchild
        </b>
        becomes the validating life because G's last surviving grandchild is deemed to have been alive at G's death, when the great-grandchildren's interests were created.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (5) - Child in Gestation Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, to pay the income equally among G's living children; on the death of G's last surviving child, to accumulate the income for 21 years; on the 21st anniversary of the death of G's last surviving child, to pay the corpus and accumulated income to G's then-living descendants, per stirpes; if none, to X Charity. At G's death his child (A) was 6 years old, and G's wife (W) was pregnant. After G's death, W gave birth to their second child (B).
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interests in favor of G's descendants and in favor of X Charity are valid under Section 1(a)(1). The validating life is A. Under subsection (d), the possibility that a child will be born to an individual after the individual's death must be disregarded
        <b>
         for the purposes of determining validity under Section 1(a)(1).
        </b>
        Consequently, the possibility that a child will be born to G after his death must be disregarded; and the possibility that a child will be born to any of G's descendants after their deaths must also be disregarded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note, however, that the rule of subsection (d) does
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        apply to the question of the entitlement of an after-born child to take a beneficial interest in the trust. The common-law rule (sometimes codified) that a child in gestation is treated as alive, if the child is subsequently born viable, applies to this question. Thus, subsection (d) does
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        prevent B from being an income beneficiary under G's trust, nor does it prevent a descendant in gestation on the 21st anniversary of the death of G's last surviving child from being a member of the class of G's "then-living descendants," as long as such descendant has no then-living ancestor who takes instead.

         Different Validating Lives Can and in Some Cases Must Be Used.
        </b>
        Dispositions of property sometimes create more than one nonvested property interest. In such cases, the validity of each interest is treated individually. A validating life that validates one interest might or might not validate the other interests. Since it is not necessary that the same validating life be used for all interests created by a disposition, the search for a validating life for each of the other interests must be undertaken separately.

         Perpetuity Saving Clauses and Similar Provisions.
        </b>
        Knowledgeable lawyers almost routinely insert perpetuity saving clauses into instruments they draft. Saving clauses contain two components, the first of which is the
        <b>
         perpetuity-period component.
        </b>
        This component typically requires the trust or other arrangement to terminate no later than 21 years after the death of the last survivor of a group of individuals designated therein by name or class. (The lives of corporations, animals, or sequoia trees cannot be used.) The second component of saving clauses is the
        <b>
         gift-over component.
        </b>
        This component expressly creates a gift over that is guaranteed to vest at the termination of the period set forth in the perpetuity-period component, but only if the trust or other arrangement has not terminated earlier in accordance with its other terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that regardless of what group of individuals is designated in the perpetuity-period component of a saving clause, the surviving member of the group is not necessarily the individual who would be the validating life for the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in the absence of the saving clause. Without the saving clause, one or more interests or powers may in fact fail to satisfy the requirement of paragraph (1) of subsections (a), (b), or (c) for initial validity. By being designated in the saving clause, however, the survivor of the group becomes the validating life for all interests and powers in the trust or other arrangement: The saving clause confers on the last surviving member of the designated group the requisite causal connection between his or her death and the impossibility of any interest or power in the trust or other arrangement remaining in existence beyond the 21-year period following such individual's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (6) - Valid Saving Clause Case.
        </b>
        A testamentary trust directs income to be paid to the testator's children for the life of the survivor, then to the testator's grandchildren for the life of the survivor, corpus on the death of the testator's last living grandchild to such of the testator's descendants as the last living grandchild shall by will appoint; in default of appointment, to the testator's then-living descendants, per stirpes. A saving clause in the will terminates the trust, if it has not previously terminated, 21 years after the death of the testator's last surviving descendant who was living at the testator's death. The testator was survived by children.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of the saving clause, the nongeneral power of appointment in the last living grandchild and the nonvested property interest in the gift-in-default clause in favor of the testator's descendants fail the test of Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1) for initial validity. That is, were it not for the saving clause, there is no validating life. However, the surviving member of the designated group becomes the validating life, so that the saving clause does confer initial validity on the nongeneral power of appointment and on the nonvested property interest under Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the governing instrument designates a group of individuals that would cause it to be impracticable to determine the death of the survivor, the common-law courts have developed the doctrine that the validity of the nonvested property interest or power of appointment is determined as if the provision in the governing instrument did not exist. See cases cited in Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) (1983), Reporter's Note No. 3 at p. 45. See also Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)

        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        1223 (2d ed. 1956). If, for example, the designated group in Example (6) were the residents of X City (or the members of Y Country Club) living at the time of the testator's death, the saving clause would not validate the power of appointment or the nonvested property interest. Instead, the validity of the power of appointment and the nonvested property interest would be determined as if the provision in the governing instrument did not exist. Since without the saving clause the power of appointment and the nonvested property interest would fail to satisfy the requirements of Sections 1(a)(1) and 1(c)(1) for initial validity, their validity would be governed by Sections 1(a)(2) and 1(c)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        The application of the above common-law doctrine, which is not superseded by this Act and so remains in full force, is not limited to saving clauses. It also applies to trusts or other arrangements where the period thereof is directly linked to the life of the survivor of a designated group of individuals. An example is a trust to pay the income to the grantor's descendants from time to time living, per stirpes, for the period of the life of the survivor of a designated group of individuals living when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in question was created, plus the 21-year period following the survivor's death; at the end of the 21-year period, the corpus is to be divided among the grantor's then-living descendants, per stirpes, and if none, to the XYZ Charity. If the group of individuals so designated is such that it would be impracticable to determine the death of the survivor, the validity of the disposition is determined as if the provision in the governing instrument did not exist. The term of the trust is therefore governed by the 90- year permissible vesting period of paragraph (2) of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of the Statutory Rule.

        C. SECTION 1(a)(2): WAIT-AND-SEE - NONVESTED PROPERTY INTERESTS WHOSE VALIDITY IS INITIALLY IN ABEYANCE
       </h5>
       <p>
        Unlike the Common-Law Rule, the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities does not automatically invalidate nonvested property interests for which there is no validating life. A nonvested property interest that does not meet the requirements for validity under Section 1(a)(1) might still be valid under the wait-and-see provisions of Section 1(a)(2). Such an interest is invalid under Section 1(a)(2) only if in actuality it does not vest (or terminate) during the permissible vesting period. Such an interest becomes invalid, in other words, only if it is still in existence and nonvested when the permissible vesting period expires.

        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Since a wait-and-see rule against perpetuities, unlike the Common-law Rule, makes validity or invalidity turn on
        <b>
         actual
        </b>
        post-creation events, it requires that an actual period of time be measured off during which the contingencies attached to an interest are allowed to work themselves out to a final resolution. The Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities establishes a permissible vesting period of 90 years. Nonvested property interests that have neither vested nor terminated at the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period become invalid.
       </p>
       <p>
        As explained in the Prefatory Note, the permissible vesting period of 90 years is
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        an arbitrarily selected period of time. On the contrary, the 90-year period represents a reasonable approximation of - a proxy for - the period of time that would,
        <b>
         on average,
        </b>
        be produced through the use of an actual set of measuring lives identified by statute and then adding the traditional 21-year tack-on period after the death of the survivor.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the harsh aspects of the invalidating side of the Common-Law Rule, against which the adoption of the wait-and-see element in Section 1(a)(2) is designed to relieve, is that nonvested property interests at common law are invalid even though the invalidating chain of possible events
        <b>
         almost
        </b>
        certainly will
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        happen. In such cases, the violation of the Common-law Rule could be said to be merely technical. Nevertheless, at common law, the nonvested property interest is invalid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cases of technical violation fall generally into discrete categories, identified and named by Professor Leach in
        Perpetuities in a Nutshell,
        51 Harv.L.Rev. 638 (1938), as the fertile octogenarian, the administrative contingency, and the unborn widow. The following three examples illustrate how Section 1(a)(2) affects these categories.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (7) - Fertile Octogenarian Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the net income therefrom "to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of A's last surviving child to pay the corpus of the trust to A's grandchildren." G was survived by A (a female who had passed menopause) and by A's two adult children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren would be invalid at common law, and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). There is no validating life because, under the common law's conclusive presumption of lifetime fertility, which is not superseded by this Act (see Part H, below), A
        <b>
         might
        </b>
        have a third child (Z), conceived and born after G's death, who will have a child conceived and born more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the grandchildren's interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's death. The chance that the grandchildren's remainder interest will become invalid under Section 1(a)(2) is negligible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (8) - Administrative Contingency Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to such of my grandchildren, born before or after my death, as may be living upon final distribution of my estate." G was survived by children and grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of A's grandchildren would be invalid at common law, and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). The final distribution of G's estate
        <b>
         might
        </b>
        not occur within 21 years of G's death, and after G's death grandchildren might be conceived and born who might survive or fail to survive the final distribution of G's estate more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of G's children and grandchildren who were living at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the grandchildren's remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's death. Since it is almost certain that the final distribution of G's estate will occur well within this 90-year period, the chance that the grandchildren's interest will be invalid is negligible.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (9) - Unborn Widow Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, the income to be paid "to my son A for life, then to A's spouse for her life, and upon the death of the survivor of A and his spouse, the corpus to be delivered to A's then living descendants." G was survived by A, by A's wife (W), and by their adult children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the remote possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the descendants' remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if it remains in existence and nonvested 90 years after G's death. The chance that the descendants' remainder interest will become invalid under the Statutory Rule is small.

        <b>
         Age Contingencies in Excess of 21.
        </b>
        Another category of technical violation of the Common-Law Rule arises in cases of age contingencies in excess of 21 where the takers cannot be their own validating lives (unlike Example (2), above). The violation of the Common-law Rule falls into the technical category because the insertion of a saving clause would in almost all cases allow the disposition to be carried out as written. In effect, the Statutory Rule operates like the perpetuity-period component of a saving clause.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (10) - Age Contingency in Excess of 21 Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who reach the age of 30." G was survived by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two children (X and Y), both of whom were under the age of 30 when G died.
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 30 is a class gift. At common law, the interests of
        <b>
         all
        </b>
        potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid.
        Leake v. Robinson,
        2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817). This Act does not supersede the all-or-nothing rule for class gifts (see Part G, below), and so the all-or-nothing rule continues to apply under this Act. Although X and Y will either reach 30 or die under 30 within their own lifetimes, there is at G's death the possibility that A will have an afterborn child (Z) who will reach 30 or die under 30 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y. The class gift would be invalid at common law and consequently is not validated by Section 1(a)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), however, the possibility of the occurrence of this chain of events does not invalidate the children's remainder interest. The interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member remains nonvested 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although unlikely, suppose that at A's death Z's age is such that he could be alive and under the age of 30 at the expiration of the allowable waiting period. Suppose further that at A's death X or Y or both is over the age of 30. The court, upon the petition of an interested person, must under Section 3 reform G's disposition. See Example (3) in the Comment to Section 3.

         Powers of Appointment.
        </b>
        Sections 1(b) and 1(c) set forth the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities with respect to powers of appointment. A power of appointment is the authority, other than as an incident of the beneficial ownership of property, to designate recipients of beneficial interests in or powers of appointment over property. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §
        11.1 (1986). The property or property interest subject to a power of appointment is called the "appointive property."
       </p>
       <p>
        The various persons connected to a power of appointment are identified by a special terminology. The "donor" is the person who created the power of appointment. The "donee" is the person who holds the power of appointment, i.e., the powerholder. The "objects" are the persons to whom an appointment can be made. The "appointees" are the persons to whom an appointment has been made. The "takers in default" are the persons whose property interests are subject to being defeated by the exercise of the power of appointment and who take the property to the extent the power is not effectively exercised. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §
        11.2 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A power of appointment is "general" if it is exercisable in favor of the donee of the power, the donee's creditors, the donee's estate, or the creditors of the donee's estate. A power of appointment that is not general is a "nongeneral" power of appointment. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §
        11.4 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A power of appointment is "presently exercisable" if, at the time in question, the donee can by an exercise of the power create an interest in or a power of appointment over the appointive property. Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §

        321 (1940). A power of appointment is "not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent" if the only impediment to its present exercisability is a condition precedent, i.e., the occurrence of some uncertain event. Since a power of appointment terminates on the donee's death, a deferral of a power's present exercisability until a future time (even a time certain) imposes a condition precedent that the donee be alive at that future time.
       </p>
       <p>
        A power of appointment is a "fiduciary" power if it is held by a fiduciary and is exercisable by the fiduciary in a fiduciary capacity. A power of appointment that is exercisable in an individual capacity is a "nonfiduciary" power. As used in this Act, the term "power of appointment" refers to "fiduciary" and to "nonfiduciary" powers, unless the context indicates otherwise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Gray's formulation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities does not speak directly of powers of appointment, the Common-law Rule
        <b>
         is
        </b>
        applicable to powers of appointment (other than presently exercisable general powers of appointment). The principle of subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) is that a power of appointment that satisfies the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is valid under the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, and consequently it can be validly exercised, without being subjected to a waiting period during which the power's validity is in abeyance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two different tests for validity are employed at common law, depending on what type of power is at issue. In the case of a
        <b>
         nongeneral power
        </b>
        (whether or not presently exercisable) and in the case of a
        <b>
         general testamentary power,
        </b>
        the power is initially valid if, when the power was created, it is certain that the latest possible time that the power can be exercised is no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then in being. In the case of a
        <b>
         general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent,
        </b>
        the power is initially valid if it is then certain that the condition precedent to its exercise will either be satisfied or become impossible to satisfy no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then in being. Subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1) codify these rules. Under either test, initial validity depends on the existence of a validating life. The procedure for determining whether a validating life exists is essentially the same procedure explained in Part B, above, pertaining to nonvested property interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (11) - Initially Valid General Testamentary Power Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, remainder to such persons, including A's estate or the creditors of A's estate, as A shall by will appoint." G was survived by his daughter (A).
       </p>
       <p>
        A's power, which is a general testamentary power, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(c)(1). The test is whether or not the power can be exercised beyond 21 years after the death of an individual in being when the power was created (G's death). Since A's power cannot be exercised after A's death, the validating life is A, who was in being at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (12) - Initially Valid Nongeneral Power Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, remainder to such of A's descendants as A shall appoint." G was survived by his daughter (A).
       </p>
       <p>
        A's power, which is a nongeneral power, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(c)(1). The validating life is A; the analysis leading to validity is the same as applied in Example (11), above.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (13) - Case of Initially Valid General Power Not Presently Exercisable Because of a Condition Precedent.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first born child for life, then to such persons, including A's first born child or such child's estate or creditors, as A's first born child shall appoint." G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless.
       </p>
       <p>
        The power in A's first born child, which is a general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent, is valid as of its creation under Section 1(b)(1). The power is subject to a condition precedent - that A have a child - but this is a contingency that under subsection (d) is deemed certain to be resolved one way or the other within A's lifetime. A is therefore the validating life: The power cannot remain subject to the condition precedent after A's death. Note that the latest possible time that the power can be exercised is at the death of A's first born child, which might occur beyond 21 years after the death of A (and anyone else who was alive when G died). Consequently, if the power conferred on A's first born child had been a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power, the power could not be validated by Section 1(c)(1); instead, the power's validity would be governed by Section 1(c)(2).

        E. SECTIONS 1(b)(2) AND 1(c)(2): WAIT-AND-SEE-POWERS OF APPOINTMENT WHOSE VALIDITY IS INITIALLY IN ABEYANCE
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the Common-law Rule, a
        <b>
         general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent
        </b>
        is invalid as of the time of its creation if the condition
        <b>
         might
        </b>
        neither be satisfied nor become impossible to satisfy within a life in being plus 21 years. A
        <b>
         nongeneral power
        </b>
        (whether or not presently exercisable) or a
        <b>
         general testamentary power
        </b>
        is invalid as of the time of its creation if it might not terminate (by irrevocable exercise or otherwise) within a life in being plus 21 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sections 1(b)(2) and 1(c)(2), by adopting the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform, shift the ground of invalidity from possible to actual post-creation events. Under these subsections, a power of appointment that would have violated the Common-law Rule, and therefore fails the subsection (b)(1) or (c)(1) tests for
        <b>
         initial
        </b>
        validity, is nevertheless not invalid as of the time of its creation. Instead, its validity is in abeyance. A general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent is invalid only if
        <b>
         in actuality
        </b>
        the condition neither is satisfied nor becomes impossible to satisfy within the 90-year permissible vesting period. A nongeneral power or a general testamentary power is invalid only if
        <b>
         in actuality
        </b>
        it does not terminate (by irrevocable exercise or otherwise) within the 90-year permissible period.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (14) - General Testamentary Power Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first born child for life, then to such persons, including the estate or the creditors of the estate of A's first born child, as A's first born child shall by will appoint; in default of appointment, to G's grandchildren in equal shares." G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless, and by his son (B), who had two children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the general testamentary power conferred on A's first born child fails the test of Section 1(c)(1) for
        <b>
         initial
        </b>
        validity, its validity is governed by Section 1(c)(2). If A has a child, such child's death must occur within 90 years of G's death for any provision in the child's will purporting to exercise the power to be valid.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (15) - Nongeneral Power Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first born child for life, then to such of G's grandchildren as A's first born child shall appoint; in default of appointment, to the children of G's late nephew, Q." G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless, by his son (B), who had two children (X and Y), and by Q's two children (R and S).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the nongeneral power conferred on A's first born child fails the test of Section 1(c)(1) for
        <b>
         initial
        </b>
        validity, its validity is governed by Section 1(c)(2). If A has a child, such child must exercise the power within 90 years after G's death or the power becomes invalid.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (16) - General Power Not Presently Exercisable Because of a Condition Precedent.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first born child for life, then to such persons, including A's first born child or such child's estate or creditors, as A's first born child shall appoint after reaching the age of 25; in default of appointment, to G's grandchildren." G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless, and by his son (B), who had two children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power conferred on A's first born child is a general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent. Since the power fails the test of Section 1(b)(1) for
        <b>
         initial
        </b>
        validity, its validity is governed by Section 1(b)(2). If A has a child, such child must reach the age of 25 (or die under 25) within 90 years after G's death or the power is invalid.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Fiduciary Powers.
        </b>
        Purely administrative fiduciary powers are excluded from the Statutory Rule under Sections 4(2) and (3), but the only distributive fiduciary power that is excluded is the power described in Section 4(4). Otherwise, distributive fiduciary powers are subject to the Statutory Rule. Such powers are usually nongeneral powers.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (17) - Trustee's Discretionary Powers Over Income and Corpus.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, the terms of which were that the trustee was authorized to accumulate the income or pay it or a portion of it out to A during A's lifetime; after A's death, the trustee was authorized to accumulate the income or to distribute it in equal or unequal shares among A's children until the death of the survivor; and on the death of A's last surviving child to pay the corpus and accumulated income (if any) to B. The trustee was also granted the discretionary power to invade the corpus on behalf of the permissible recipient or recipients of the income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The trustee's nongeneral powers to invade corpus and to accumulate or spray income among A's children are not excluded by Section 4(4), nor are they initially valid under Section 1(c)(1). Their validity is, therefore, governed by Section 1(c)(2). Both powers become invalid thereunder, and hence no longer exercisable, 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is doubtful that the powers will become invalid, because the trust will probably terminate by its own terms earlier than the expiration of the permissible 90-year period. But if the powers do become invalid, and hence no longer exercisable, they become invalid as of the time the permissible 90-year period expires. Any exercises of either power that took place before the expiration of the permissible 90-year period are not invalidated retroactively. In addition, if the powers do become invalid, a court in an appropriate proceeding must reform the instrument in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.

        F. THE VALIDITY OF THE DONEE'S EXERCISE OF A VALID POWER
       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that a power of appointment is valid, either because it (i) was not subject to the Statutory Rule to begin with, (ii) is initially valid under Sections 1(b)(1) or 1(c)(1), or (iii) becomes valid under Sections 1(b)(2) or 1(c)(2), means merely that the power can be validly exercised. It does not mean that any exercise that the donee decides to make is valid. The validity of the interests or powers created by the exercise of a valid power is a separate matter, governed by the provisions of this Act. A key factor in deciding the validity of such appointed interests or appointed powers is determining when they were created for purposes of this Act. Under Section 2, as explained in the Comment thereto, the time of creation is when the power was exercised if it was a presently exercisable general power; and if it was a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power, the time of creation is when the power was created. This is the rule generally accepted at common law (see Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §
        1.2, Comment d (1983); Restatement of Property
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        392 (1944)), and it is the rule adopted under this Act (except for purposes of Section 5 only, as explained in the Comment to Section 5).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (18) - Exercise of a Nongeneral Power of Appointment.
        </b>
        G was the life income beneficiary of a trust and the donee of a nongeneral power of appointment over the succeeding remainder interest, exercisable in favor of M's descendants (except G). The trust was created by the will of G's mother, M, who predeceased him. G exercised his power by his will, directing the income to be paid after his death to his brother B's children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of B's last surviving child, to pay the corpus of the trust to B's grandchildren. B predeceased M; B was survived by his two children, X and Y, who also survived M and G.
       </p>
       <p>
        G's power and his appointment are valid. The power and the appointed interests were created at M's death when the power was created, not on G's death when it was exercised. See Section 2. G's power passes Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity: G himself is the validating life. G's appointment also passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity: Since B was dead at M's death, the validating life is the survivor of B's children, X and Y.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suppose that G's power was exercisable only in favor of G's own descendants, and that G appointed the identical interests in favor of his own children and grandchildren. Suppose further that at M's death, G had two children, X and Y, and that a third child, Z, was born later. X, Y, and Z survived G. In this case, the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren would not pass Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Its validity would be governed by Section 1(a)(2), under which it would be valid if G's last surviving child died within 90 years after M's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        If G's power were a general testamentary power of appointment, rather than a nongeneral power, the solution would be the same. The period of the Statutory Rule with respect to interests created by the exercise of a general testamentary power starts to run when the power was created (at M's death, in this example), not when the power was exercised (at G's death).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (19) - Exercise of a Presently Exercisable General Power of Appointment.
        </b>
        G was the life income beneficiary of a trust and the donee of a presently exercisable general power of appointment over the succeeding remainder interest. G exercised the power by deed, directing the trustee after his death to pay the income to G's children in equal shares for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of his last surviving child to pay the corpus of the trust to his grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        The validity of G's power is not in question: A presently exercisable general power of appointment is not subject to the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. G's appointment, however, is subject to the Statutory Rule. If G reserved a power to revoke his appointment, the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Under Section 2, the appointed remainder interest was created at G's death. The validating life for his grandchildren's remainder interest is G's last surviving child.
       </p>
       <p>
        If G's appointment were irrevocable, however, the grandchildren's remainder interest fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. Under Section 2, the appointed remainder interest was created upon delivery of the deed exercising G's power (or when the exercise otherwise became effective). Since the validity of the grandchildren's remainder interest is governed by Section 1(a)(2), the remainder interest becomes invalid, and the disposition becomes subject to reformation under Section 3, if G's last surviving child lives beyond 90 years after the effective date of G's appointment.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (20) - Exercises of Successively Created Nongeneral Powers of Appointment.
        </b>
        G devised property to A for life, remainder to such of A's descendants as A shall appoint. At his death, A exercised his nongeneral power by appointing to his child B for life, remainder to such of B's descendants as B shall appoint. At his death, B exercised his nongeneral power by appointing to his child C for life, remainder to C's children. A and B were living at G's death. Thereafter, C was born. A later died, survived by B and C. B then died survived by C.
       </p>
       <p>
        A's nongeneral power passes Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity. A is the validating life. B's nongeneral power, created by A's appointment, also passes Sections 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity. Since under Section 2 the appointed interests and powers are created at G's death, and since B was then alive, B is the validating life for his nongeneral power. (If B had been born after G's death, however, his power would have failed Section 1(c)(1)'s test for initial validity; its validity would be governed by Section 1(c)(2), and would turn on whether or not it was exercised by B within 90 years after G's death.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Although B's power is valid, his exercise may be partly invalid. The remainder interest in favor of C's children fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. The period of the Statutory Rule begins to run at G's death, under Section 2. (Since B's power was a nongeneral power, B's appointment under the common-law relation back doctrine of powers of appointment is treated as having been made by A. If B's appointment related back no further than that, of course, it would have been validated by Section 1(a)(1) because C was alive at A's death. However, A's power was also a nongeneral power, so relation back goes another step. A's appointment - which now includes B's appointment - is treated as having been made by G.) Since C was not alive at G's death, he cannot be the validating life. And, since C might have more children more than 21 years after the deaths of A and B and any other individual who was alive at G's death, the remainder interest in favor of his children is not initially validated by Section 1(a)(1). Instead, its validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2), and turns on whether or not C dies within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that if either A's power or B's power (or both) had been a general testamentary power rather than a nongeneral power, the above solution would not change. However, if either A's power or B's power (or both) had been a presently exercisable general power, B's appointment would have passed Sections 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. (If A had the presently exercisable general power, the appointed interests and power would be created at A's death, not G's; and if the presently exercisable general power were held by B, the appointed interests and power would be created at B's death.)

        <b>
         Common-Law "Second-look" Doctrine.
        </b>
        As indicated above, both at common law and under this Act (except for purposes of Section 5 only, as explained in the Comment to Section 5), appointed interests and powers established by the exercise of a general testamentary power or a nongeneral power are created when the power was created, not when the power was exercised. In applying this principle, the common law recognizes a so-called doctrine of second look, under which the facts existing on the date of the exercise are taken into account in determining the validity of appointed interests and appointed powers. E.g.,
        <b>
         Warren's Estate,
        </b>
        320 Pa. 112, 182 A. 396 (1930);
        In re Estate of Bird,
        225 Cal.App.2d 196, 37 Cal.Rptr. 288 (1964). The common-law's second-look doctrine in effect constitutes a limited wait-and-see doctrine, and is therefore subsumed under but not totally superseded by this Act. The following example, which is a variation of Example (18) above, illustrates how the second-look doctrine operates at common law and how the situation would be analyzed under this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (21) - Second-look Case.
        </b>
        G was the life income beneficiary of a trust and the donee of a nongeneral power of appointment over the succeeding remainder interest, exercisable in favor of G's descendants. The trust was created by the will of his mother, M, who predeceased him. G exercised his power by his will, directing the income to be paid after his death to his children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of his last surviving child, to pay the corpus of the trust to his grandchildren. At M's death, G had two children, X and Y. No further children were born to G, and at his death X and Y were still living.
       </p>
       <p>
        The common-law solution of this example is as follows: G's appointment is valid under the Common-law Rule. Although the period of the Rule begins to run at M's death, the facts existing at G's death can be taken into account. This second look at the facts discloses that G had no additional children. Thus the possibility of additional children, which existed at M's death when the period of the Rule began to run, is disregarded. The survivor of X and Y, therefore, becomes the validating life for the remainder interest in favor of G's grandchildren, and G's appointment is valid. The common-law's second-look doctrine would not, however, save G's appointment if he actually had one or more children after M's death and if at least one of these after-born children survived G.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this Act, if no additional children are born to G after M's death, the common-law second-look doctrine can be invoked as of G's death to declare G's appointment then to be valid under Section 1(a)(1); no further waiting is necessary. However, if additional children
        <b>
         are
        </b>
        born to G and one or more of them survives G, Section 1(a)(2) applies and the validity of G's appointment depends on G's last surviving child dying within 90 years after M's death.

        In general, perpetuity saving or termination clauses can be used in either of two ways. The predominant use of such clauses is as an override clause. That is, the clause is not an integral part of the dispositive terms of the trust, but operates independently of the dispositive terms; the clause provides that all interests must vest no later than at a specified time in the future, and sometimes also provides that the trust must then terminate, but only if any interest has not previously vested or if the trust has not previously terminated. The other use of such a clause is as an integral part of the dispositive terms of the trust; that is, the clause is the provision that directly regulates the duration of the trust. Traditional perpetuity saving or termination clauses do not use a "later-of" approach; they mark off the maximum time of vesting or termination only by reference to a 21-year period following the death of the survivor of specified lives in being at the creation of the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1(e) applies to a non-traditional clause called a "later-of" (or "longer-of") clause. Such a clause might provide that the maximum time of vesting or termination of any interest or trust must occur no later than the later of (A) 21 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being at the creation of the trust or (B) 90 years after the creation of the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Uniform Act as originally promulgated, this type of "later-of" clause would not achieve a "later-of" result. If used as an override clause in conjunction with a trust whose terms were, by themselves, valid under the Common-law Rule, the "later-of" clause did no harm. The trust would be valid under the Common-law Rule as codified in Section 1(a)(1) because the clause itself would neither postpone the vesting of any interest nor extend the duration of the trust. But, if used either (1) as an override clause in conjunction with a trust whose terms were not valid under the Common-law Rule or (2) as the provision that directly regulated the duration of the trust, the "later-of" clause would not cure the perpetuity violation in case (1) and would create a perpetuity violation in case (2). In neither case would the clause qualify the trust for validity at common law under Section 1(a)(1) because the clause would not guarantee that all interests will be certain to vest or terminate no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive.** In any given case, 90 years can turn out to be longer than the period produced by the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years language.
        <br/>
        **By substantial analogous authority, the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years prong of the "later-of" clause under discussion is not sustained by the separability doctrine (described in Part H of the Comment to Section 1). See, e.g., Restatement of Property
        §
        376 Comments e and f and illustration 3 (1944); Easton v. Hall, 323 Ill. 397, 154 N.E. 216 (1926); Thorne v. Continental Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 305 Ill. App. 222, 27 N.E.2d 302 (1940). The inapplicability of the separability doctrine is also supported by perpetuity policy, as described in the text above.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the clause would fail to qualify the trust for validity under the Common-law Rule of Section 1(a)(1), the nonvested interests in the trust would be subject to the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2) and vulnerable to a reformation suit under Section 3. Under Section 1(a)(2), an interest that is not valid at common law is invalid unless it actually vests or terminates within 90 years after its creation. Section 1(a)(2) does not grant such nonvested interests a permissible vesting period of either 90 years or a period of 21 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being. Section 1(a)(2) only grants such interests a period of 90 years in which to vest.
       </p>
       <p>
        The operation of Section 1(a), as outlined above, is also supported by perpetuity policy. If Section 1(a) allowed a "later-of" clause to achieve a "later-of" result, it would authorize an improper use of the 90-year permissible vesting period of Section 1(a)(2). The 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2) is designed to approximate the period that,
        <b>
         on average,
        </b>
        would be produced by using actual lives in being plus 21 years. Because in any given case the period actually produced by lives in being plus 21 years can be shorter or longer than 90 years, an attempt to utilize a 90-year period in a "later-of" clause improperly seeks to turn the 90-year average into a minimum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Set against this background, the addition of Section 1(e) is quite beneficial. Section 1(e) limits the effect of this type of "later-of" language to 21 years after the death of the survivor of the specified lives, in effect transforming the clause into a traditional perpetuity saving/termination clause. By doing so, Section 1(e) grants initial validity to the trust under the Common-law Rule as codified in Section 1(a)(1) and precludes a reformation suit under Section 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that Section 1(e) covers variations of the "later-of" clause described above, such as a clause that postpones vesting until the later of (A) 20 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being or (B) 89 years. Section 1(e) does not, however, apply to all dispositions that incorporate a "later-of" approach. To come under Section 1(e), the specified-lives prong must include a tack-on period of up to 21 years. Without a tack-on period, a "later-of" disposition, unless valid at common law, comes under Section 1(a)(2) and is given 90 years in which to vest. An example would be a disposition that creates an interest that is to vest upon "the later of the death of my widow or 30 years after my death."

         Coordination of the Federal Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax with the Uniform Statutory Rule.
        </b>
        In 1990, the Treasury Department announced a decision to coordinate the tax regulations under the "grandfathering" provisions of the federal generation-skipping transfer tax with the Uniform Act. Letter from Michael J. Graetz, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (Tax Policy), to Lawrence J. Bugge, President, National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (Nov. 16, 1990) (hereinafter
        Treasury Letter
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1433(b)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 generally exempts ("grandfathers") trusts from the federal generation-skipping transfer tax that were irrevocable on September 25, 1985. This section adds, however, that the exemption shall apply "only to the extent that such transfer is not made out of corpus added to the trust after September 25, 1985." The provisions of Section 1433(b)(2) were first implemented by Temp. Treas. Reg.
        §
        26.2601-1, promulgated by T.D. 8187 on March 14, 1988. Insofar as the Uniform Act is concerned, a key feature of that temporary regulation is the concept that the statutory reference to "corpus added to the trust after September 25, 1985" not only covers actual post-9/25/85 transfers of new property or corpus to a grandfathered trust but "constructive" additions as well. Under the temporary regulation as first promulgated, a "constructive" addition occurs if, after 9/25/85, the donee of a nongeneral power of appointment exercises that power "in a manner that may postpone or suspend the vesting, absolute ownership or power of alienation of an interest in property for a period, measured from the date of creation of the trust, extending beyond any life in being at the date of creation of the trust plus a period of 21 years. If a power is exercised by creating another power it will be deemed to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be exercised." Temp. Treas. Reg.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        26.2601- 1(b)(1)(v)(B)(2) (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Uniform Act was promulgated in 1986 and applies only prospectively, any "grandfathered" trust would have become irrevocable prior to the enactment of the Uniform Act in any state. Nevertheless, the second sentence of Section 5(a) extends the wait-and-see approach to post-effective-date exercises of nongeneral powers even if the power itself was created prior to the effective date of the Uniform Act in any state. Consequently, a post-effective-date exercise of a nongeneral power of appointment created in a "grandfathered" trust could come under the provisions of the Uniform Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The literal wording, then, of Temp. Treas. Reg.
        §
        26.2601-1(b)(1)(v)(B)(2) (1988), as first promulgated, could have jeopardized the grandfathered status of an exempt trust if (1) the trust created a nongeneral power of appointment, (2) the donee exercised that nongeneral power, and (3) the Uniform Act is the perpetuity law applicable to the donee's exercise. This possibility arose not only because the donee's exercise itself might come under the 90-year permissible vesting period of Section 1(a)(2) if it otherwise violated the Common-law Rule and hence was not validated under Section 1(a)(1). The possibility also arose in a less obvious way if the donee's exercise created another nongeneral power. The last sentence of the temporary regulation states that "if a power is exercised by creating another power it will be deemed to be exercised to whatever extent the second power may be exercised."
       </p>
       <p>
        In late March 1990, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) filed a formal request with the Treasury Department asking that measures be taken to coordinate the regulation with the Uniform Act. By the Treasury Letter referred to above, the Treasury Department responded by stating that it "will amend the temporary regulations to accommodate the 90-year period under USRAP as originally promulgated [in 1986] or as amended [in 1990 by the addition of subsection (e)]." This should effectively remove the possibility of loss of grandfathered status under the Uniform Act merely because the donee of a nongeneral power created in a grandfathered trust inadvertently exercises that power in violation of the Common-law Rule or merely because the donee exercises that power by creating a second nongeneral power that might, in the future, be inadvertently exercised in violation of the Common-law Rule.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Treasury Letter states, however, that any effort by the donee of a nongeneral power in a grandfathered trust to obtain a "later-of" specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years or 90-years approach will be treated as a constructive addition, unless that effort is nullified by state law. As explained above, the Uniform Act, as originally promulgated in 1986 or as amended in 1990 by the addition of Section 1(e), nullifies any direct effort to obtain a "later-of" approach by the use of a "later-of" clause.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Treasury Letter states that an indirect effort to obtain a "later-of" approach would also be treated as a constructive addition that would bring grandfathered status to an end, unless the attempt to obtain the later-of approach is nullified by state law. The Treasury Letter indicates that an indirect effort to obtain a "later-of" approach could arise if the donee of a nongeneral power successfully attempts to prolong the duration of a grandfathered trust by switching from a specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years perpetuity period to a 90-year perpetuity period, or vice versa. Donees of nongeneral powers in grandfathered trusts would therefore be well advised to resist any temptation to wait until it becomes clear or reasonably predictable which perpetuity period will be longer and then make a switch to the longer period if the governing instrument creating the power utilized the shorter period. No such attempted switch and no constructive addition will occur if in each instance a traditional specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years perpetuity saving clause is used.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any such attempted switch is likely in any event to be nullified by state law and, if so, the attempted switch will not be treated as a constructive addition. For example, suppose that the original grandfathered trust contained a standard perpetuity saving clause declaring that all interests in the trust must vest no later than 21 years after the death of the survivor of specified lives in being. In exercising a nongeneral power created in that trust, any indirect effort by the donee to obtain a "later-of" approach by adopting a 90-year perpetuity saving clause will likely be nullified by Section 1(e). If that exercise occurs at a time when it has become clear or reasonably predictable that the 90-year period will prove longer, the donee's exercise would constitute language in a governing instrument that seeks to operate in effect to postpone the vesting of any interest until the later of the specified-lives-in-being-plus-21-years period or 90 years. Under Section 1(e), "that language is inoperative to the extent it produces a period of time that exceeds 21 years after the death of the survivor of the specified lives."
       </p>
       <p>
        Quite apart from Section 1(e), the relation-back doctrine generally recognized in the exercise of nongeneral powers stands as a doctrine that could potentially be invoked to nullify an attempted switch from one perpetuity period to the other perpetuity period. Under that doctrine, interests created by the exercise of a nongeneral power are considered created by the donor of that power. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers
        §
        11.1 comment b (1986). As such, the maximum vesting period applicable to interests created by the exercise of a nongeneral power would apparently be covered by the perpetuity saving clause in the document that created the power, notwithstanding any different period the donee purports to adopt.

        375 (1944), which is that where an instrument is ambiguous - that is, where it is fairly susceptible to two or more constructions, one of which causes a Rule violation and the other of which does not - the construction that does not result in a Rule violation should be adopted. Cases supporting this view include

        The constructional preference for validity is not superseded by this Act, but its role is likely to be different. The situation is likely to be that one of the constructions to which the ambiguous instrument is fairly susceptible would result in validity under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1), but the other construction does not necessarily result in invalidity; rather it results in the interest's validity being governed by Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2). Nevertheless, even though the result of adopting the other construction is not as harsh as it is at common law, it is expected that the courts will incline toward the construction that validates the disposition under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1).

         Conclusive Presumption of Lifetime Fertility.

        <b>
         conclusively
        </b>
        presumed to be able to have children throughout their entire lifetimes. This principle is not superseded by this Act, and in view of new advances in medical science that allow women to become pregnant after menopause by way of test-tube fertilization (see Sauer, Paulson &amp; Lobo,
        A Preliminary Report on Oocyte Donation Extending Reproductive Potential to Women Over 40,
        323 N.Eng.J.Med. 1157 (1990)) and the widely accepted rule of construction that adopted children are presumptively included in class gifts, the conclusive presumption of lifetime fertility is not unrealistic. Since even elderly individuals probably cannot be excluded from adopting children based on their ages alone, the possibility of having children by adoption is seldom extinct. See, generally, Waggoner

         Act Supersedes Doctrine of Infectious Invalidity.
        </b>
        At common law, the invalidity of an interest can, under the doctrine of infectious invalidity, be held to invalidate one or more otherwise valid interests created by the disposition or even invalidate the entire disposition. The question turns on whether the general dispositive scheme of the transferor will be better carried out by eliminating only the invalid interest or by eliminating other interests as well. This is a question that is answered on a case-by-case basis. Several items are relevant to the question, including who takes the stricken interests in place of those the transferor designated to take.
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of infectious invalidity is superseded by this Act by Section 3, under which courts, upon the petition of an interested person, are required to
        <b>
         reform
        </b>

         Separability.
        </b>
        The common law's separability doctrine is that when an interest is
        <b>
         expressly
        </b>
        subject to alternative contingencies, the situation is treated as if two interests were created in the same person or class. Each interest is judged separately; the invalidity of one of the interests does not necessarily cause the other one to be invalid. This common-law principle was established in
        Longhead v. Phelps,
        2 Wm.Bl. 704, 96 Eng. Rep. 414 (K.B. 1770), and is followed in this country. L. Simes &amp; A. Smith, The Law of Future Interests

        376 (1944). Under this doctrine, if property is devised "to B if X-event or Y-event happens," B in effect has two interests, one contingent on X-event happening and the other contingent on Y-event happening. If the interest contingent on X-event but not the one contingent on Y-event is invalid, the consequence of separating B's interest into two is that only one of them, the one contingent on X-event, is invalid. B still has a valid interest - the one contingent on the occurrence of Y-event.
       </p>
       <p>
        The separability principle is not superseded by this Act. As illustrated in the following example, its invocation will usually result in one of the interests being initially validated by Section 1(a)(1) and the validity of the other interests being governed by Section 1(a)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (22) - Separability Case.
        </b>
        G devised real property "to A for life, then to A's children who survive A and reach 25, but if none of A's children survives A or if none of A's children who survives A reaches 25, then to B." G was survived by his brother (B), by his daughter (A), by A's husband (H), and by A's two minor children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 25 fails the test of Section 1(a)(1) for initial validity. Its validity is, therefore, governed by Section 1(a)(2) and depends on each of A's children doing any one of the following things within 90 years after G's death: predeceasing A, surviving A and failing to reach 25, or surviving A and reaching 25.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the separability doctrine, B has two interests. One of them is contingent on none of A's children surviving A. That interest passes Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; the validating life is A. B's other interest, which is contingent on none of A's surviving children reaching 25, fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity. Its validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2) and depends on each of A's surviving children either reaching 25 or dying under 25 within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suppose that after G's death, A has a third child (Z). A subsequently dies, survived by her husband (H) and by X, Y, and Z. This, of course, causes B's interest that was contingent on none of A's children surviving A to terminate. If X, Y, and Z had all reached the age of 25 by the time of A's death, their interest would vest at A's death, and that would end the matter. If one or two, but not all three of them, had reached the age of 25 at A's death, B's other interest - the one that was contingent on none of A's surviving children reaching 25 - would also terminate. As for the children's interest, if the after- born child Z's age was such at A's death that Z could not be alive and under the age of 25 at the expiration of the allowable waiting period, the class gift in favor of the children would be valid under Section 1(a)(2), because none of those then under 25 could fail either to reach 25 or die under 25 after the expiration of the allowable 90-year waiting period. If, however, Z's age at A's death was such that Z could be alive and under the age of 25 at the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period, the circumstances requisite to reformation under Section 3(2) would arise, and the court would be justified in reforming G's disposition by reducing the age contingency with respect to Z to the age he would reach on the date when the permissible vesting period is due to expire. See Example (3) in the Comment to Section 3. So reformed, the class gift in favor of A's children could not become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), and the children of A who had already reached 25 by the time of A's death could receive their shares immediately.

         The "All-or-Nothing" Rule with Respect to Class Gifts; the Specific Sum and Sub-Class Doctrines.
        </b>
        The common law applies an "all-or-nothing" rule with respect to class gifts, under which a class gift stands or falls as a whole. The all-or-nothing rule, usually attributed to
        Leake v. Robinson,
        2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817), is commonly stated as follows: If the interest of any potential class member
        <b>
         might
        </b>
        vest too remotely, the entire class gift violates the Rule. Although this Act does not supersede the basic idea of the much-maligned "all-or-nothing" rule, the evils sometimes attributed to it are substantially if not entirely eliminated by the wait-and-see feature of the Statutory Rule and by the availability of reformation under Section 3, especially in the circumstances described in Sections 3(2) and (3). For illustrations of the application of the all-or-nothing rule under this Act, see Examples (3), (4), and (6) in the Comment to Section 3.

        The common law also recognizes a doctrine called the specific-sum doctrine, which is derived from
        Storrs v. Benbow,
        3 De G.M. &amp; G. 390, 43 Eng. Rep. 153 (Ch. 1853), and states: If a specified sum of money is to be paid to each member of a class, the interest of each class member is entitled to separate treatment and is valid or invalid under the Rule on its own. The common law also recognizes a doctrine called the sub-class doctrine, which is derived from

        </i>
        175 F.Supp. 367 (D.D.C. 1959); Restatement of Property
        §
        389 (1944). The specific-sum and sub-class doctrines are not superseded by this Act. The operation of the specific-sum doctrine under this Act is illustrated in the following example.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (23) - Specific-Sum Case.
        </b>
        G bequeathed "$10,000 to each child of A, born before or after my death, who attains 25." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). X but not Y had already reached 25 at G's death. After G's death a third child (Z) was born to A.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the phrase "born before or after my death" had been omitted, the class would close as of G's death under the common-law's rule of construction known as the rule of convenience: The after-born child, Z, would not be entitled to a $10,000 bequest, and the interests of both X and Y would be valid upon their creation at G's death. X's interest would be valid because it was initially vested; neither the Common-law Rule nor the Statutory Rule applies to interests that are vested upon their creation. Although the interest of Y was not vested upon its creation, it would be initially valid under Section 1(a)(1) because Y would be his own validating life; Y will either reach 25 or die under 25 within his own lifetime.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inclusion of the phrase "before or after my death," however, would probably be construed to mean that G intended after-born children to receive a $10,000 bequest. See
        Earle Estate,
        369 Pa. 52, 85 A.2d 90 (1951). Assuming that this construction were adopted, the specific-sum doctrine allows the interest of each child of A to be treated separately from the others for purposes of the Statutory Rule. For the reasons cited above, the interests of X and Y are initially valid under Section 1(a)(1). The nonvested interest of Z, however, fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; there is no validating life because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could reach 25 or die under 25 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Under Section 1(a)(2), the validity of Z's interest depends on Z's reaching (or failing to reach) 25 within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        The operation of the sub-class doctrine under this Act is illustrated in the following example.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (24) - Sub-Class Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child, the proportionate share of corpus of the one so dying shall go to the children of such child." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. A now has died, survived by X, Y, and Z.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the sub-class doctrine, each remainder interest in favor of the children of a child of A is treated separately from the others. This allows the remainder interest in favor of X's children and the remainder interest in favor of Y's children to be validated under Section 1(a)(1). X is the validating life for the one, and Y is the validating life for the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of the children of Z fails Section 1(a)(1)'s test for initial validity; there is no validating life because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could have children more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Under Section 1(a)(2), the validity of the remainder interest in favor of Z's children depends on Z's dying within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note why both of the requirements of the sub-class rule are met. The ultimate takers are described as a group of sub-classes rather than as a single class: "children of the child so dying," as opposed to "grandchildren." The share to which each separate sub-class is entitled is certain to be finally determined within a life in being plus 21 years: As of A's death, who is a life in being, it is certain to be known how many children he had surviving him; since in fact there were three, we know that each sub-class will ultimately be entitled to one-third of the corpus, neither more nor less. The possible failure of the one-third share of Z's children does not increase to one-half the share going to X's and Y's children; they still are entitled to only one-third shares. Indeed, should it turn out that X has children but Y does not, this would not increase the one-third share to which X's children are entitled.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (25) - General Testamentary Powers - Sub-Class Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child, the proportionate share of corpus of the one so dying shall go to such persons as the one so dying shall by will appoint; in default of appointment, to G's grandchildren in equal shares." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A.
       </p>
       <p>
        The general testamentary powers conferred on each of A's children are entitled to separate treatment under the principles of the sub-class doctrine. See above. Consequently, the powers conferred on X and Y, A's children who were living at G's death, are initially valid under Section 1(c)(1). But the general testamentary power conferred on Z, A's child who was born after G's death, fails the test of Section 1(c)(1) for
        <b>
         initial
        </b>
        validity. The validity of Z's power is governed by Section 1(c)(2). Z's death must occur within 90 years after G's death if any provision in Z's will purporting to exercise his power is to be valid.

         Duration of Indestructible Trusts - Termination of Trusts by Beneficiaries.
        </b>
        The widely accepted view in American law is that the beneficiaries of a trust other than a charitable trust can compel its premature termination if all beneficiaries consent
        <b>
         and
        </b>
        if such termination is not expressly restrained or impliedly restrained by the existence of a "material purpose" of the settlor in establishing the trust. Restatement (Second) of Trusts

        Nothing in this Act supersedes this principle. One modification, however, is necessary: As to trusts that contain a nonvested property interest or power of appointment whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element adopted in Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2), the courts can be expected to determine that the applicable perpetuity period is 90 years.

        <b>
         Comment. - Subsection (a): General Principles of Property Law; When Nonvested Property Interests and Powers of Appointment are Created.
        </b>
        Under Section 1, the period of time allowed by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is marked off from the time of creation of the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in question. Section 5, with certain exceptions, provides that the Act applies only to nonvested property interests and powers of appointment created on or after the effective date of the Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), and in the second sentence of Section 5(a) for purposes of that section only, the time of creation of nonvested property interests and powers of appointment is determined under general principles of property law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a will becomes effective as a dispositive instrument upon the decedent's death, not upon the execution of the will, general principles of property law determine that the time when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by will is created is at the decedent's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by inter vivos transfer, the time when the interest or power is created is the date the transfer becomes effective for purposes of property law generally, normally the date of delivery of the deed.
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the testamentary or inter vivos exercise of a power of appointment, general principles of property law adopt the "relation back" doctrine. Under that doctrine, the appointed interests or powers are created when the power was
        <b>
         created
        </b>
        not when it was exercised, if the exercised power was a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power. If the exercised power was a general power presently exercisable, the relation back doctrine is not followed; the time of creation of the appointed property interests or appointed powers is regarded as the time when the power was irrevocably
        <b>
         exercised,
        </b>
        not when the power was created.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsection (b): Postponement, for Purposes of this Act, of the Time when a Nonvested Property Interest or a Power of Appointment is Created in Certain Cases.
        </b>
        The reason that the significant date for purposes of this Act is the date of creation is that the unilateral control of the interest (or the interest subject to the power) by one person is then relinquished. In certain cases, all beneficial rights in a property interest (including an interest subject to a power of appointment) remain under the unilateral control of one person even after the delivery of the deed or even after the decedent's death. In such cases, under this subsection, the interest or power is created, for purposes of this Act, when no person, acting alone, has a power presently exercisable to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the property interest (or the property interest subject to the power of appointment).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (1) - Revocable Inter-Vivos Trust Case.
        </b>
        G conveyed property to a trustee, directing the trustee to pay the net income therefrom to himself (G) for life, then to G's son A for his life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor of A's children who are living at G's death, and upon the death of such last surviving child, the corpus of the trust is to be distributed among A's then-living descendants, per stirpes. G retained the power to revoke the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of G's reservation of the power to revoke the trust, the creation for purposes of this Act of the nonvested property interests in this case occurs at G's death, not when the trust was established. This is in accordance with common law, for purposes of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities.
        Cook v. Horn,
        214 Ga. 289, 104 S.E.2d 461 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rationale that justifies the postponement of the time of creation in such cases is as follows. A person, such as G in the above example, who alone can exercise a power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of a nonvested property interest is in effect the owner of that property interest. Thus, any nonvested property interest subject to such a power is not created for purposes of this Act until the power terminates (by release, expiration at the death of the donee, or otherwise). Similarly, as noted above, any property interest or power of appointment created in an appointee by the irrevocable exercise of such a power is created at the time of the donee's irrevocable exercise.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power need not be a power to revoke, and it need not be held by the settlor or transferor. A
        <b>
         presently exercisable
        </b>
        power held by
        <b>
         any
        </b>
        person
        <b>
         acting alone
        </b>
        to make himself the unqualified beneficial owner of the nonvested property interest or the property interest subject to a power of appointment is sufficient. If such a power exists, the time when the interest or power is created, for purposes of this Act, is postponed until the termination of the power (by irrevocable exercise, release, contract to exercise or not to exercise, expiration at the death of the donee, or otherwise). An example of such a power that might not be held by the settlor or transferor is a power, held by any person who can act alone, fully to invade the corpus of a trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        An important consequence of the idea that a power need not be held by the settlor for the time of creation to be postponed under this section is that it makes postponement possible even in cases of testamentary transfers.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (2) - Testamentary Trust Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, remainder to such persons (including A, his creditors, his estate, and the creditors of his estate) as A shall appoint; in default of appointment, the property to remain in trust to pay the income to A's children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of A's last surviving child, to pay the corpus to A's grandchildren." A survived G.
       </p>
       <p>
        If A exercises his presently exercisable general power, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by A's appointment is created for purposes of this Act when the power is exercised. If A does not exercise the power, the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are created when A's power terminates (at A's death). In either case, the postponement is justified because the transaction is the equivalent of G's having devised the full remainder interest (following A's income interest) to A and of A's having in turn transferred that interest in accordance with his exercise of the power or, in the event the power is not exercised, devised that interest at his death in accordance with G's gift-in-default clause. Note, however, that if G had conferred on A a
        <b>
         nongeneral
        </b>
        power or a general
        <b>
         testamentary
        </b>
        power, A's power of appointment, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by A's appointment, if any, and the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause would be created at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Unqualified Beneficial Owner of the Nonvested Property Interest or the Property Interest Subject to a Power of Appointment.
        </b>
        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the presently exercisable power must be one that entitles the donee of the power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the
        <b>
         nonvested property interest (or the property interest subject to a nongeneral power of appointment, a general testamentary power of appointment, or a general power of appointment not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent).
        </b>
        This requirement was met in Example (2), above, because A could by appointing the remainder interest to himself become the unqualified beneficial owner of all the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause. In Example (2) it is not revealed whether A, if he exercised the power in his own favor, also had the right as sole beneficiary of the trust to compel the termination of the trust and possess himself as unqualified beneficial owner of the property that was the subject of the trust. Having the power to compel termination of the trust is not necessary. If, for example, the trust in Example (2) was a spendthrift trust or contained any other feature that under the relevant local law (see
        Claflin v. Claflin,
        149 Mass. 19, 20 N.E. 454 (1889); Restatement (Second) of Trusts
        §
        337 (1959)) would prevent A as sole beneficiary from compelling termination of the trust, A's presently exercisable general power over the remainder interest would still postpone the time of creation of the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause because the power enables A to become the unqualified beneficial owner of such interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Furthermore, it is not necessary that the donee of the power have the power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of
        <b>
         all beneficial
        </b>
        rights
        <b>
         in the trust.
        </b>
        In Example (2), the property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are not created for purposes of this Act until A's power expires (or on A's appointment, until the power's exercise) even if someone other than A was the income beneficiary of the trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Presently Exercisable Power.
        </b>
        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power must be presently exercisable. A testamentary power does not qualify. A power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent does not qualify. If the condition precedent later becomes satisfied, however, so that the power becomes presently exercisable, the interests or powers subject thereto are not created, for purposes of this Act, until the termination of the power. The common-law decision of
        Fitzpatrick v. Mercantile Safe Deposit Co.,
        220 Md. 534, 155 A.2d 702 (1959), appears to be in accord with this proposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (3) - General Power in Unborn Child Case.
        </b>
        G devised property "to A for life, then to A's first-born child for life, then to such persons, including A's first-born child or such child's estate or creditors, as A's first-born child shall appoint." There was a further provision that in default of appointment, the trust would continue for the benefit of G's descendants. G was survived by his daughter (A), who was then childless. After G's death, A had a child, X. A then died, survived by X.
       </p>
       <p>
        As of G's death, the power of appointment in favor of A's first-born child and the property interests in G's gift-in-default clause would be regarded as having been created at G's death because the power in A's first-born child was then a general power not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent.
       </p>
       <p>
        At X's birth, X's general power became presently exercisable and excluded from the Statutory Rule. X's power also qualifies as a power exercisable by one person alone to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the property interests in G's gift-in-default clause. Consequently, the nonvested property interests in G's gift-in-default clause are not created, for purposes of this Act, until the termination of X's power. If X exercises his presently exercisable general power, before or after A's death, the appointed interests or powers are created, for purposes of this Act, as of X's exercise of the power.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Partial Powers.
        </b>
        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the person must have a presently exercisable power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the full nonvested property interest or the property interest subject to a power of appointment described in Section 1(b) or 1(c). If, for example, the subject of the transfer was an undivided interest such as a one-third tenancy in common, the power qualifies even though it relates only to the undivided one-third interest in the tenancy in common; it need not relate to the whole property. A power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of only part of the nonvested property interest or the property interest subject to a power of appointment, however, does not postpone the time of creation of the interests or powers subject thereto, unless the power is actually exercised.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (4) - "5 and 5" Power Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, remainder to such persons (including A, his creditors, his estate, and the creditors of his estate) as A shall by will appoint;" in default of appointment, the governing instrument provided for the property to continue in trust. A was given a noncumulative power to withdraw the greater of $5,000 or 5% of the corpus of the trust annually. A survived G. A never exercised his noncumulative power of withdrawal.
       </p>
       <p>
        G's death marks the time of creation of: A's testamentary power of appointment; any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created in G's gift-in-default clause; and any appointed interest or power created by a testamentary exercise of A's power of appointment over the remainder interest. A's general power of appointment over the remainder interest does not postpone the time of creation because it is not a presently exercisable power. A's noncumulative power to withdraw a portion of the trust each year does not postpone the time of creation as to all or the portion of the trust with respect to which A allowed his power to lapse each year because A's power is a power over only part of any nonvested property interest or property interest subject to a power of appointment in G's gift-in-default clause and over only part of any appointed interest or power created by a testamentary exercise of A's general power of appointment over the remainder interest. The same conclusion has been reached at common law. See
        Ryan v. Ward,
        192 Md. 342, 64 A.2d 258 (1949).

        If, however, in any year A exercised his noncumulative power of withdrawal in a way that created a nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) in the withdrawn amount (for example, if A directed the trustee to transfer the amount withdrawn directly into a trust created by A), the appointed interests (or powers) would be created when the power was exercised, not when G died.

         Incapacity of the Donee of the Power.
        </b>
        The fact that the donee of a power lacks the capacity to exercise it, by reason of minority, mental incompetency, or any other reason, does not prevent the power held by such person from postponing the time of creation under subsection (b), unless the governing instrument extinguishes the power (or prevents it from coming into existence) for that reason.

         Joint Powers - Community Property; Marital Property.
        </b>
        For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power must be exercisable by one person alone. A joint power does not qualify, except that, if the bracketed sentence of subsection (b) is enacted, a joint power over community property or over marital property under the Uniform Marital Property Act held by individuals married to each other is, for purposes of this Act, treated as a power exercisable by one person acting alone. See Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers)
        §
        1.2, Comment b and illustrations 5, 6, and 7 (1983), for the rationale supporting the enactment of the bracketed sentence and examples illustrating its principle.

         Subsection (c): No Staggered Periods.
        </b>
        For purposes of this Act, subsection (c) in effect treats a transfer of property to a previously funded trust or other existing property arrangement as having been made when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in the original contribution was created. The purpose of subsection (c) is to avoid the administrative difficulties that would otherwise result where subsequent transfers are made to an existing irrevocable trust. Without subsection (c), the allowable period under the Statutory Rule would be marked off in such cases from different times with respect to different portions of the same trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (5) - Series of Transfers Case.
        </b>
        In Year One, G created an irrevocable inter vivos trust, funding it with $20,000 cash. In Year Five, when the value of the investments in which the original $20,000 contribution was placed had risen to a value of $30,000, G added $10,000 cash to the trust. G died in Year Ten. G's will poured the residuary of his estate into the trust. G's residuary estate consisted of Blackacre (worth $20,000) and securities (worth $80,000). At G's death, the value of the investments in which the original $20,000 contribution and the subsequent $10,000 contribution were placed had risen to a value of $50,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Were it not for subsection (c), the permissible vesting period under the Statutory Rule would be marked off from three different times: Year One, Year Five, and Year Ten. The effect of subsection (c) is that the permissible vesting period under the Statutory Rule starts running only once - in Year One - with respect to the entire trust. This result is defensible not only to prevent the administrative difficulties inherent in recognizing staggered periods. It also is defensible because if G's inter vivos trust had contained a perpetuity saving clause, the perpetuity-period component of the clause would be geared to the time when the original contribution to the trust was made; this clause would cover the subsequent contributions as well. Since the major justification for the adoption by this Act of the wait-and-see method of perpetuity reform is that it amounts to a statutory insertion of a saving clause (see the Prefatory Note), subsection (c) is consistent with the theory of this Act.

         Comment. - Reformation.
        </b>
        This section requires a court, upon the petition of an interested person, to reform a disposition
        <b>
         whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2)
        </b>
        so that the reformed disposition is within the limits of the 90-year period allowed by those subsections, in the manner deemed by the court most closely to approximate the transferor's manifested plan of distribution, in three circumstances: First, when (after the application of the Statutory Rule) a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment becomes invalid under the Statutory Rule; second, when a class gift has not but still might become invalid under the Statutory Rule and the time has arrived when the share of one or more class members is to take effect in possession or enjoyment; and third, when a nonvested property interest can vest, but cannot do so within the allowable 90-year period under the Statutory Rule.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is anticipated that the circumstances requisite to reformation will seldom arise, and consequently that this section will be applied infrequently. If, however, one of the three circumstances arises, the court in reforming is authorized to alter existing interests or powers and to create new interests or powers by implication or construction based on the transferor's manifested plan of distribution as a whole. In reforming, the court is urged not to invalidate any vested interest retroactively (the doctrine of infectious invalidity having been superseded by this Act, as indicated in the Comment to Section 1). The court is also urged not to reduce an age contingency in excess of 21 unless it is absolutely necessary, and if it is deemed necessary to reduce such an age contingency, not to reduce it automatically to 21 but rather to reduce it no lower than absolutely necessary. See Example (3), below; Waggoner,
        Perpetuity Reform,

         Judicial Sale of Land Affected by Future Interests.
        </b>
        Although this section - except for cases that fall under subsections (2) or (3) - defers the time when a court is directed to reform a disposition until the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period, this section is not to be understood as preventing an earlier application of other remedies. In particular, in the case of interests in land not in trust, the principle, codified in many states, is widely recognized that there is judicial authority, under specified circumstances, to order a sale of land in which there are future interests.

         Duration of the Indestructibility of Trusts - Termination of Trusts by Beneficiaries.
        </b>
        As noted in Part G of the Comment to Section 1, it is generally accepted that a trust cannot remain indestructible beyond the period of the rule against perpetuities. Under this Act, the period of the rule against perpetuities applicable to a trust whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) is 90 years. The result of any reformation under Section 3 is that all nonvested property interests in the trust will vest in interest (or terminate) no later than the 90th anniversary of their creation. In the case of trusts containing a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment whose validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2), courts can therefore be expected to adopt the rule that no purpose of the settlor, expressed in or implied from the governing instrument, can prevent the beneficiaries of a trust other than a charitable trust from compelling its termination after 90 years after every nonvested property interest and power of appointment in the trust was created.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsection (1): Invalid Property Interest or Power of Appointment.
        </b>
        Subsection (1) is illustrated by the following examples.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (1) - Multiple Generation Trust.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, then to A's grandchildren for the life of the survivor, and on the death of A's last surviving grandchild, the corpus of the trust is to be divided among A's then living descendants per stirpes; if none, to" a specified charity. G was survived by his child (A) and by A's two minor children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A died, survived by his children (X, Y, and Z) and by three grandchildren (M, N, and O).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are four interests subject to the Statutory Rule in this example: (1) the income interest in favor of A's children, (2) the income interest in favor of A's grandchildren, (3) the remainder interest in the corpus in favor of A's descendants who survive the death of A's last surviving grandchild, and (4) the alternative remainder interest in the corpus in favor of the specified charity. The first interest is initially valid under Section 1(a)(1); A is the validating life for that interest. There is no validating life for the other three interests, and so their validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, as is likely, A and A's children all die before the 90th anniversary of G's death, the income interest in favor of A's grandchildren is valid under Section 1(a)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, as is also likely, some of A's grandchildren are alive on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the alternative remainder interests in the corpus of the trust then become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), giving rise to Section 3(1)'s prerequisite to reformation. A court would be justified in reforming G's disposition by closing the class in favor of A's descendants as of the 90th anniversary of G's death (precluding new entrants thereafter), by moving back the condition of survivorship on the class so that the remainder interest is in favor of G's descendants who survive the 90th anniversary of G's death (rather than in favor of those who survive the death of A's last surviving grandchild), and by redefining the class so that its makeup is formed as if A's last surviving grandchild died on the 90th anniversary of G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (2) - Sub-Class Case.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then in equal shares to A's children for their respective lives; on the death of each child the proportionate share of corpus of the one so dying shall go to the descendants of such child surviving at such child's death, per stirpes." G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). After G's death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A died, survived by X, Y, and Z.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the sub-class doctrine, each remainder interest in favor of the descendants of a child of A is treated separately from the others. Consequently, the remainder interest in favor of X's descendants and the remainder interest in favor of Y's descendants are valid under Section 1(a)(1): X is the validating life for the one, and Y is the validating life for the other.
       </p>
       <p>
        The remainder interest in favor of the descendants of Z is not validated by Section 1(a)(1) because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could have descendants more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Instead, the validity of the remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants is governed by Section 1(a)(2), under which its validity depends on Z's dying within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although unlikely, suppose that Z is still living 90 years after G's death. The remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants will then become invalid under the Statutory Rule, giving rise to subsection (1)'s prerequisite to reformation. In such circumstances, a court would be justified in reforming the remainder interest in favor of Z's descendants by making it indefeasibly vested as of the 90th anniversary of G's death. To do this, the court would reform the disposition by eliminating the condition of survivorship of Z and closing the class to new entrants after the 90th anniversary of G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Subsection (2): Class Gifts Not Yet Invalid.
        </b>
        Subsection (2), which, upon the petition of an interested person, requires reformation in certain cases where a class gift has not but still might become invalid under the Statutory Rule, is illustrated by the following examples.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (3) - Age Contingency in Excess of 21.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who reach the age of 30." G was survived by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two children (X and Y), both of whom were under the age of 30 when G died.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the remainder interest in favor of A's children who reach 30 is a class gift, at common law (
        Leake v. Robinson,
        2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Rep. 979 (Ch. 1817)) and under this Act (see Part G of the Comment to Section 1) the interests of
        <b>
         all
        </b>
        potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid. Although X and Y will either reach 30 or die under 30 within their own lifetimes, there is at G's death the possibility that A will have an afterborn child (Z) who will reach 30 or die under 30 more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y. There is no validating life, and the class gift is therefore not validated by Section 1(a)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), the children's remainder interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member neither vests nor terminates within 90 years after G's death. If in fact there is an afterborn child (Z), and if upon A's death, Z has at least reached an age such that he cannot be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the class gift is valid. (Note that at Z's
        <b>
         birth
        </b>
        it would have been known whether or not Z could be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death; nevertheless, even if it was
        <b>
         then
        </b>
        certain that
        <b>
         Z
        </b>
        could
        <b>
         not
        </b>
        be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death, the class gift could not
        <b>
         then
        </b>
        have been declared valid because, A being alive, it was
        <b>
         then
        </b>
        possible for one or more additional children to have later been born to or adopted by A.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Although unlikely, suppose that at A's death (prior to the expiration of the 90-year period), Z's age was such that he
        <b>
         could
        </b>
        be alive and under the age of 30 on the 90th anniversary of G's death. Suppose further that at A's death X and Y were over the age of 30. Z's interest and hence the class gift as a whole is not yet invalid under the Statutory Rule because Z might die under the age of 30 within the remaining part of the 90-year period following G's death; but the class gift might become invalid because Z might be alive and under the age of 30, 90 years after G's death. Consequently, the prerequisites to reformation set forth in subsection (2) are satisfied, and a court would be justified in reforming G's disposition to provide that Z's interest is contingent on reaching the age he can reach if he lives to the 90th anniversary of G's death. This would render Z's interest valid so far as the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is concerned, and allow the class gift as a whole to be declared valid. X and Y would thus be entitled immediately to their one-third shares each. If Z's interest later vested, Z would receive the remaining one-third share. If Z failed to reach the required age under the reformed disposition, the remaining one-third share would be divided equally between X and Y or their successors in interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (4) - Case Where Subsection (2) Applies, Not Involving an Age Contingency in Excess of 21.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income "to A for life, then to A's children; the corpus of the trust is to be equally divided among A's children who graduate from an accredited medical school or law school." G was survived by A, by A's spouse (H), and by A's two minor children (X and Y).
       </p>
       <p>
        As in Example (3), the remainder interest in favor of A's children is a class gift, and the common-law principle is not superseded by this Act by which the interests of
        <b>
         all
        </b>
        potential class members must be valid or the class gift is totally invalid. Although X and Y will either graduate from an accredited medical or law school, or fail to do so, within their own lifetimes, there is at G's death the possibility that A will have an after-born child (Z), who will graduate from an accredited medical or law school (or die without having done either) more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, H, X, and Y. The class gift would not be valid under the Common-law Rule and is, therefore, not validated by Section 1(a)(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Section 1(a)(2), the children's remainder interest becomes invalid only if an interest of a class member neither vests nor terminates within 90 years after G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suppose in fact that there is an afterborn child (Z), and that at A's death Z was a freshman in college. Suppose further that at A's death X had graduated from an accredited law school and that Y had graduated from an accredited medical school. Z's interest and hence the class gift as a whole is not yet invalid under Section 1(a)(2) because the 90-year period following G's death has not yet expired; but the class gift might become invalid because Z might be alive but not a graduate of an accredited medical or law school 90 years after G's death. Consequently, the prerequisites to reformation set forth in Section 3(2) are satisfied, and a court would be justified in reforming G's disposition to provide that Z's interest is contingent on graduating from an accredited medical or law school within 90 years after G's death. This would render Z's interest valid so far as the Section 1(a)(2) is concerned and allow the class gift as a whole to be declared valid. X and Y would thus be entitled immediately to their one-third shares each. If Z's interest later vested, Z would receive the remaining one-third share. If Z failed to graduate from an accredited medical or law school within the allowed time under the disposition as so reformed, the remaining one-third share would be divided equally between X and Y or their successors in interest.

        <b>
         Subsection (3): Interests that Can Vest But Not Within the 90-Year Permissible Vesting Period.
        </b>
        In exceedingly rare cases, an interest might be created that can vest, but not within the 90-year permissible vesting period of the Statutory Rule. This may be the situation when the interest was created (See Example (5)), or it may become the situation at some time thereafter (see Example (6)). Whenever the situation occurs, the court, upon the petition of an interested person, is required by subsection (3) to reform the disposition within the limits of the 90-year permissible vesting period.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (5) - Case of an Interest, as of its Creation, being Impossible to Vest Within the 90-Year Period.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to divide the income, per stirpes, among G's descendants from time to time living, for 100 years. At the end of the 100-year period following G's death, the trustee is to distribute the corpus and accumulated income to G's then-living descendants, per stirpes; if none, to the XYZ Charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nonvested property interest in favor of G's descendants who are living 100 years after G's death can vest, but not within the 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2). The interest would violate the Common-law Rule, and hence is not validated by Section 1(a)(1), because there is no validating life. In these circumstances, a court is required by Section 3(3) to reform G's disposition within the limits of the 90-year period. An appropriate result would be for the court to lower the period following G's death from a 100-year period to a 90-year period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Note that the circumstance that triggers the direction to reform the disposition under this subsection is that the nonvested property interest still can vest, but cannot vest within the 90-year period of Section 1(a)(2). It is not necessary that the interest be certain to become
        <b>
         invalid
        </b>
        under that subsection. For the interest to be certain to become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), it would have to be certain that it can neither vest
        <b>
         nor terminate
        </b>
        within the 90-year period. In this example, the interest of G's descendants might
        <b>
         terminate
        </b>
        within the period (by all of G's descendants dying within 90 years of G's death). If this were to happen, the interest of XYZ Charity would be valid because it would have vested within the allowable period. However, it was thought desirable to require reformation without waiting to see if this would happen: The only way that G's
        <b>
         descendants,
        </b>
        who are G's
        <b>
         primary
        </b>
        set of beneficiaries, would have a chance to take the property is to reform the disposition within the limits of the 90-year period on the ground that their interest cannot
        <b>
         vest
        </b>
        within the allowable period and subsection (3) so provides.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (6) - Case of an Interest after its Creation Becoming Impossible to Vest Within the 90-Year Period.
        </b>
        G devised property in trust, with the income to be paid to A. The corpus of the trust was to be divided among A's children who reach 30, each child's share to be paid on the child's 30th birthday; if none reaches 30, to the XYZ Charity. G was survived by A and by A's two children (X and Y). Neither X nor Y had reached 30 at G's death.
       </p>
       <p>
        The class gift in favor of A's children who reach 30 would violate the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities and, thus, is not validated by Section 1(a)(1). Its validity is therefore governed by Section 1(a)(2).
       </p>
       <p>
        Suppose that after G's death, and during A's lifetime, X and Y die and a third child (Z) is born to or adopted by A. At A's death, Z is living but her age is such that she cannot reach 30 within the remaining part of the 90-year period following G's death. As of A's death, it has become the situation that Z's interest cannot vest within the allowable period. The circumstances requisite to reformation under subsection (3) have arisen. An appropriate result would be for the court to lower the age contingency to the age Z can reach 90 years after G's death.

        Section 4 lists seven exclusions from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule). Some are declaratory of existing law; others are contrary to existing law. Since the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is superseded by this Act (or a statutory version or variation thereof is repealed by this Act), a nonvested property interest, power of appointment, or other arrangement excluded from the Statutory Rule by this section is not subject to any rule against perpetuities, statutory or otherwise.

         A. SUBSECTION (1): NONDONATIVE TRANSFERS EXCLUDED
        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
          Rationale.
         </b>
         In line with long-standing scholarly commentary, subsection (1) excludes (with certain enumerated exceptions) nonvested property interests and powers of appointment arising out of a nondonative transfer. The rationale for this exclusion is that the Rule Against Perpetuities is a wholly inappropriate instrument of social policy to use as a control over such arrangements. The period of the rule - a life in being plus 21 years - is not suitable for nondonative transfers, and this point applies with equal force to the 90-year allowable waiting period under the wait-and-see element of Section 1 because that period represents an approximation of the period of time that would be produced, on average, by using a statutory list identifying actual measuring lives and adding a 21-year period following the death of the survivor.
        </p>
        <p>
         No general exclusion from the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is recognized for nondonative transfers, and so subsection (1) is contrary to existing common law. (But see
         Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Bruken Realty Corp.,
         67 N.Y.2d 156, 492 N.E.2d 379, 384 (1986), pointing out the inappropriateness of the period of a life in being plus 21 years to cases of commercial and governmental transactions and noting that the Rule Against Perpetuities can invalidate legitimate transactions in such cases.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection (1) is therefore inconsistent with decisions holding the Common-law Rule to be applicable to the following types of property interests or arrangements when created in a nondonative, commercial-type transaction, as they almost always are: options (e.g.,
         Milner v. Bivens,
         335 S.E.2d 288 (Ga. 1985)); preemptive rights in the nature of a right of first refusal (e.g.,
         Atchison v. City of Englewood,
         170 Colo. 295, 463 P.2d 297 (1969);
         Robroy Land Co., Inc. v. Prather,
         24 Wash. App. 511, 601 P.2d 297 (1969)); leases to commence in the future, at a time certain or on the happening of a future event such as the completion of a building (e.g.,
         Southern Airways Co. v. DeKalb County,
         101 Ga. App. 689, 115 S.E.2d 207 (1960)); nonvested easements; top leases and top deeds with respect to interests in minerals (e.g.,
         <i>
          Peveto v. Starkey,
         </i>
         645 S.W.2d 770 (Tex. 1982)); and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Consideration Does Not Necessarily Make the Transfer Nondonative.
         </b>
         A transfer can be supported by consideration and still be donative in character and hence not excluded from the Statutory Rule. A transaction that is essentially gratuitous in nature, accompanied by donative intent on the part of at least one party to the transaction, is not to be regarded as nondonative simply because it is for consideration. Thus, for example, the exclusion would not apply if a parent purchases a parcel of land for full and adequate consideration, and directs the seller to make out the deed in favor of the purchaser's daughter for life, remainder to such of the daughter's children as reach 25. The nonvested property interest of the daughter's children is subject to the Statutory Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Some Transactions Not Excluded Even if Considered Nondonative.
         </b>
         Some types of transactions - although in some sense supported by consideration and hence arguably nondonative - arise out of a domestic situation, and should not be excluded from the Statutory Rule. To avoid uncertainty with respect to such transactions, subsection (1) specifies that nonvested property interests or powers of appointment arising out of any of the following transactions are not excluded by subsection (1)'s nondonative-transfers exclusion: a premarital or postmarital agreement; a separation or divorce settlement; a spouse's election, such as the "widow's election" in community property states; an arrangement similar to any of the foregoing arising out of a prospective, existing, or previous marital relationship between the parties; a contract to make or not to revoke a will or trust; a contract to exercise or not to exercise a power of appointment; a transfer in full or partial satisfaction of a duty of support; or a reciprocal transfer. The term "reciprocal transfer" is to be interpreted in accordance with the reciprocal transfer doctrine in the tax law (see
         United States v. Estate of Grace,
         395 U.S. 316 (1969)).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Other Means of Controlling Some Nondonative Transfers Desirable.
         </b>
         Some commercial transactions respecting land or mineral interests, such as options in gross (including rights of first refusal), leases to commence in the future, nonvested easements, and top leases and top deeds in commercial use in the oil and gas industry, directly or indirectly restrain the alienability of property or provide a disincentive to improve the property. Although controlling the duration of such interests is desirable, they are excluded by subsection (1) from the Statutory Rule because, as noted above, the period of a life in being plus 21 years - actual or by the 90-year proxy - is inappropriate for them; that period is appropriate for family-oriented, donative transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Committee was aware that a few states have adopted statutes on perpetuities that include special limits on certain commercial transactions (e.g., Fla. Stat.
         §
         689.22(3)(a); Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 30,
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         194(a)), and in fact the Committee itself drafted a comprehensive version of Section 4 that would have imposed a 40-year period-in-gross limitation in specified cases. In the end, however, the Committee did not present that version to the National Conference for approval because it was of the opinion that the control of these interests is better left to other types of statutes, such as marketable title acts (e.g., the Uniform Simplification of Land Transfers Act) and the Uniform Dormant Mineral Interests Act, backed up by the potential application of the common-law rules regarding unreasonable restraints on alienation.

         B. SUBSECTIONS (2)-(7): OTHER EXCLUSIONS
        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
          Subsection (2) - Administrative Fiduciary Powers.
         </b>
         Fiduciary powers are subject to the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, unless specifically excluded. Purely administrative fiduciary powers are excluded by subsections (2) and (3), but distributive fiduciary powers are generally speaking not excluded. The only distributive fiduciary power excluded is the one described in subsection (4).
        </p>
        <p>
         The application of subsection (2) to fiduciary powers can be illustrated by the following example.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Example (1).
         </b>
         G devised property in trust, directing the trustee (a bank) to pay the income to A for life, then to A's children for the life of the survivor, and on the death of A's last surviving child to pay the corpus to B. The trustee is granted the discretionary power to sell and to reinvest the trust assets and to invade the corpus on behalf of the income beneficiary or beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
         The trustee's fiduciary power to sell and reinvest the trust assets is a purely administrative power, and under subsection (2) of this section is not subject to the Statutory Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         The trustee's fiduciary power to invade corpus, however, is a nongeneral power of appointment that is not excluded from the Statutory Rule. Its validity, and hence its exercisability, is governed by Section 1. Under that section, since the power is not initially valid under Section 1(c)(1), Section 1(c)(2) applies and the power ceases to be exercisable 90 years after G's death.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Subsection (3) - Powers to Appoint a Fiduciary.
         </b>
         Subsection (3) excludes from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities powers to appoint a fiduciary (a trustee, successor trustee, or co-trustee, a personal representative, successor personal representative, or co-personal representative, an executor, successor executor, or co-executor, etc.). Sometimes such a power is held by a fiduciary and sometimes not. In either case, the power is excluded from the Statutory Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Subsection (4) - Certain Distributive Fiduciary Power.
         </b>
         The only distributive fiduciary power excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is the one described in subsection (4); the excluded power is a discretionary power of a trustee to distribute principal before the termination of a trust to a beneficiary who has an indefeasibly vested interest in the income and principal.
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Example (2).
         </b>
         G devised property in trust, directing the trustee (a bank) to pay the income to A for life, then to A's children; each child's share of principal is to be paid to the child when he or she reaches 40; if any child dies under 40, the child's share is to be paid to the child's estate as a property interest owned by such child. The trustee is given the discretionary power to advance all or a portion of a child's share before the child reaches 40. G was survived by A, who was then childless.
        </p>
        <p>
         The trustee's discretionary power to distribute principal to a child before the child's 40th birthday is excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. (The trustee's
         <b>
          duty
         </b>
         to pay the income to A and after A's death to A's children is not subject to the Statutory Rule because it is a duty, not a power.)

         <b>
          Subsection (5) - Charitable or Governmental Gifts.
         </b>
         Subsection (5) codifies the common-law principle that a nonvested property interest held by a charity, a government, or a governmental agency or subdivision is excluded from the Rule Against Perpetuities if the interest was preceded by an interest that is held by another charity, government, or governmental agency or subdivision.

         The nonvested property interest held by Y City (an executory interest) is excluded from the Statutory Rule under subsection (5) because it was preceded by a property interest (a fee simple determinable) held by a governmental subdivision, X School District.
        </p>
        <p>
         The exclusion of charitable and governmental gifts applies only in the circumstances described. If a nonvested property interest held by a charity is preceded by a property interest that is held by a noncharity, the exclusion does not apply; rather, the validity of the nonvested property interest held by the charity is governed by the other sections of this Act.

         Subsection (7) assures that all property interests, powers of appointment, or arrangements that were excluded from the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities or are excluded by another statute of this state are also excluded from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Possibilities of reverter and rights of entry (also known as rights of re-entry, rights of entry for condition broken, and powers of termination) are not subject to the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities, and so are excluded from the Statutory Rule. By statute in some states, possibilities of reverter and rights of entry expire if they do not vest within a specified period of years (such as 40 years).

        <b>
         Comment. - Subsection (a): Act Not Retroactive.
        </b>
        This section provides that, except as provided in subsection (b), the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act apply only to nonvested property interests or powers of appointment created on or after the Act's effective date. With one exception, in determining when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is created, the principles of Section 2 are applicable. Thus, for example, a property interest (or a power of appointment) created in a revocable inter vivos trust is created when the power to revoke terminates. See Example (1) in the Comment to Section 2.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second sentence of subsection (a) establishes a special rule for nonvested property interests (and powers of appointment) created by the exercise of a power of appointment. For purposes of this section only, a nonvested property interest (or a power of appointment) created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise of the power becomes irrevocable. Consequently, all the provisions of this Act except Section 5(b) apply to a nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by a donee's exercise of a power of appointment where the donee's exercise, whether revocable or irrevocable, occurs on or after the effective date of this Act. All the provisions of this Act except Section 5(b) also apply where the donee's exercise occurred before the effective date of this Act if: (i) that pre-effective-date exercise was revocable
        <b>
         and
        </b>
        (ii) that revocable exercise becomes irrevocable on or after the effective date of this Act. This special rule applies to the exercise of all types of powers of appointment - presently exercisable general powers, general testamentary powers, and nongeneral powers.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the application of this special rule determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply, then for all such purposes, the time of creation of the appointed nonvested property interest (or appointed power of appointment) is determined by reference to Section 2, without regard to the special rule contained in the second sentence of Section 5(a).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the application of this special rule of Section 5(a) determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) do not apply, then Section 5(b) is the only potentially applicable provision of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (1) - Testamentary Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act.
        </b>
        G was the donee of a general testamentary power of appointment created by the will of his mother, M. M died in 1980. Assume that the effective date of this Act in the jurisdiction is January 1, 1987. G died in 1988, leaving a will that exercised his general testamentary power of appointment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the special rule in the second sentence of Section 5(a), any nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by G in his will in exercising his general testamentary power was created (for purposes of Section 5) at G's death in 1988, which was
        <b>
         after
        </b>
        the effective date of this Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consequently, all the provisions of this Act apply (except Section 5(b)). That point having been settled, the next step is to determine whether the nonvested property interests or powers of appointment created by G's testamentary appointment are initially valid under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1), or whether the wait-and-see element established in Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) apply. If the wait-and-see element does apply, it must also be determined when the allowable 90-year waiting period starts to run. In making these determinations, the principles of Section 2 control the time of creation of the nonvested property interests (or powers of appointment); under Section 2, since G's power was a general testamentary power of appointment, the common-law relation-back doctrine applies and the appointed nonvested property interests (and appointed powers of appointment) are created at M's death in 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        If G's testamentary power of appointment had been a nongeneral power rather than a general power, the same results as described above would apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (2) - Presently Exercisable Nongeneral Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act.
        </b>
        Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that G's power of appointment was a presently exercisable nongeneral power. If G exercised the power in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), the same results as described above in Example (1) would apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Example (3) - Presently Exercisable General Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act.
        </b>
        Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that G's power of appointment was a presently exercisable general power. If G exercised the power in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), all the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply; for such purposes, Section 2 controls the date of creation of the appointed nonvested property interests (or appointed powers of appointment), without regard to the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a). With respect to the exercise of a presently exercisable general power, it is possible - indeed, probable - that the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a) and the rules of Section 2 agree on the same date of creation for their respective purposes, that date being the date the power was irrevocably exercised (or a revocable exercise thereof became irrevocable).

         Subsection (b): Reformation of Pre-existing Instruments.
        </b>
        Although the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act do not apply retroactively, subsection (b) recognizes a court's authority to exercise its equitable power to reform instruments that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (or of a statutory version or variation thereof) and to which the Statutory Rule does not apply because the offending nonvested property interest or power of appointment in question was created before the effective date of this Act. This equitable power to reform is recognized only where the violation of the former rule against perpetuities is determined in a judicial proceeding that is commenced on or after the effective date of this Act. See below.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without legislative authorization or direction, the courts in four states - Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and West Virginia - have held that they have the power to reform instruments that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities.

        55-111 (1948). The California statute is silent as to whether or not it applies to nonvested property interests and powers of appointment created prior to the effective date of the Act; the only significant California appellate decision to apply the statute,
        <i>
         Estate of Ghiglia,
        </i>
        42 Cal.App.3d 433, 116 Cal. Rptr. 827 (1974), involved a will where the testator died after the Act's effective date. The Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas statutes explicitly do not apply retroactively. The Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and West Virginia decisions, however, invoked the court's equitable power (sometimes called the cy pres power, and sometimes called the doctrine of equitable approximation or equitable modification) to reform pre-existing instruments that contained a violation of the Common-law Rule. Subsection (b) constitutes statutory authority for a court to exercise its equitable reformation power.

         Reformation Experience So Far.
        </b>
        The existing judicial opinions and legislative provisions purport to adopt a principle of reformation that is consistent with the theme that the technique of reform should be shaped to grant every appropriate opportunity for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries. The New Hampshire court, for example, said that "where there is a general and a particular intent, and the particular one cannot take effect, the words shall be so construed as to give effect to the general intent."
        Edgerly v. Barker,
        66 N.H. 434, 467, 31 A. 900, 912 (1891) (citation omitted). The Hawaii court held that "any interest which would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities shall be reformed within the limits of that rule to approximate most closely the intention of the creator of the interest."
        <i>
         In re Estate of Chun Quan Yee Hop,
        </i>
        52 Hawaii 40, 46, 469 P.2d 183, 187 (1970). The Mississippi court described the reformation principle as "a simple rule of judicial construction, designed to aid the court to ascertain and carry out, as nearly as may be, the intention of the donor."
        <i>
         Carter v. Berry,
        </i>
        243 Miss. 321, 370, 140 So.2d 843, 852 (1962). The California statute provides that the authority to reform "shall be liberally construed and applied to validate [the] interest to the fullest extent consistent with [the] ascertained intent." Cal. Civ. Code
        §
        715.5.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, all the cases that have arisen so far have been of one general type - contingencies in excess of 21 years - and all of the courts have simply ordered a reduction of the age or period in gross to 21.

        <b>
         Guidance as to How to Reform.
        </b>
        The above reformation efforts are unduly narrow. Subsection (b) is to be understood as authorizing a more appropriate technique - judicial insertion of a saving clause into the instrument. See Browder,
        Construction, Reformation, and the Rule Against Perpetuities,
        62 Mich.L.Rev. 1 (1963); Waggoner,
        <i>
         Perpetuity Reform,
        </i>
        81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718, 1755-1759 (1983); Langbein &amp; Waggoner,
        <i>
         Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law?,
        </i>
        130 U.Pa.L.Rev. 521, 546-49 (1982). This method of reformation allows reformation to achieve an after-the-fact duplication of a professionally competent product. Such a technique would have been especially suitable in the cases that have already arisen, for it probably would have allowed the dispositions in all of them to have been rendered valid without disturbing the transferor's intent at all. See Waggoner,
        <i>
         Perpetuity Reform,
        </i>
        81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718, 1756 n. 103 (1983). The insertion of a saving clause grants a more appropriate opportunity for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries. Furthermore, it would also be a suitable technique in fertile octogenarian, unborn widow, and administrative contingency cases. A saving clause is one of the formalistic devices that a professionally competent lawyer would have used before the fact to assure initial validity in these cases. Insofar as other violations are concerned, the saving clause technique also grants every appropriate opportunity for the property to go to the intended beneficiaries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In selecting the lives to be used for the perpetuity-period component of the saving clause that in a given case is to be inserted after the fact, the principle to be adopted is the same one that ought to guide lawyers in drafting such a clause before the fact: The group selected should be appropriate to the facts and the disposition. While the exact make-up of the group in each case would be settled by litigation, the individuals designated in Section 1.3(2) of the Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) (1983) as the measuring lives would be an appropriate referent for the court to consider. Care should be taken in formulating the gift-over component, so that it is appropriate to the dispositive scheme. Among possible recipients that the court might consider designating are: (i) the persons entitled to the income on the 21st anniversary of the death of the last surviving individual designated by the court for the perpetuity-period component and in the proportions thereof to which they are then so entitled; if no proportions are specified, in equal shares to the permissible recipients of income; or (ii) the grantor's descendants per stirpes who are living 21 years after the death of the last surviving individual designated by the court for the perpetuity-period component; if none, to the grantor's heirs at law determined as if the grantor died 21 years after the death of the last surviving individual designated in the perpetuity-period component.

         Violation Must be Determined in a Judicial Proceeding Commenced On or After the Effective Date of this Act.
        </b>
        The equitable power to reform is recognized by Section 5(b) only in situations where the violation of the former rule against perpetuities is determined in a judicial proceeding commenced on or after the effective date of this Act. The equitable power to reform would typically be exercised in the same judicial proceeding in which the invalidity is determined.

    - The purpose of this section is to effectuate the intention of the testator by rendering valid a limitation which would have been otherwise invalid as violative of the rule against perpetuities. Since January 1, 1820, words which had previously been construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue are now construed to mean a definite failure of issue, and the limitations founded thereon are no longer void for remoteness.

    - A devise to a person with limitation over to another, in the event of the first taker's death without issue, is a limitation which takes effect when the first devisee dies without heir or issue, and vests in the first devisee a defeasible fee.

         It is manifest from reading this section that it was the legislative intent that every limitation in a deed or will contingent upon the dying of any person without heirs, etc., should be construed to be a limitation to take effect when such person shall die not having such heirs, etc. People's Nat'l Bank v.

     Section based on proposition that invalid limitation not intended.
    </b>
    - The statutory rule is based upon the proposition that a testator does not intend to create an invalid limitation, but intends instead to make the limitation effective at a time not violative of the rule against perpetuities. Hence, where a will contains a bare provision that a limitation shall take effect upon the death of a person without issue, this section saves the limitation from a claim of remoteness by arbitrarily fixing the date of the person's death as the time for determining whether he dies without issue.

     But plainly intended limitation given effect even if invalidation results.

    - If a will displays the testator's intention that a die-without-issue limitation shall take effect earlier than the time fixed in this section, thus avoiding a possible claim of remoteness, the statutory purpose is served and the intent should be given effect. In these circumstances, an express declaration of intent on the face of the will is not necessary; it suffices if the intention to fix an earlier vesting date can be discerned from the application of conventional rules of construction. A contrary holding would permit use of this section to thwart, rather than effectuate, a testator's intention. Thomas v. Thomas, <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 4</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 795 (1982).

         - In 1833 W. made his will, and died. By clause 6 he gives to his daughter, D., a designated tract of land, to her and the heirs of her body; but should D. "die without heir, as above mentioned, my wish is that said land shall return to my other heirs, and be sold, and the moneys arising from the sale to be equally divided among all my heirs." It was held that D. took a fee simple estate in the land defeasible upon her dying without a child living at her death. Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224 (1872).

Bearing in mind the language of this section, and the holdings of the Supreme Court the limitation to W.H.P. was contingent upon N.E.P. dying without issue, and the language of the will had reference to the death of N.E.P. and not to the death of the testatrix.

Where the sellers agreed to develop any lots for which the purchaser exercised the option, the sellers were obligated to perform this duty within a reasonable time or be subject to remedies the purchaser might pursue for the sellers' breach of the express terms of the contract.

     History and effect of statute.
    </b>
    - In Virginia, as between joint tenants, survivorship was abolished as early as July 1st, 1787, but this act was held to have no application to tenants by entireties. See Thornton v. Thornton, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 179 (1825); M'Clanachan v. Siter, Price &amp; Co., 42 Va. (2 Gratt.) 280 (1845); Norman's Ex'x v. Cunningham, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 63 (1848); Dooley v. Baynes, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 644</cite>, 10 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 974</cite> (1890).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was also held that the statute abolishing survivorship between joint tenants had no application where the estate in joint tenancy had not vested, and, hence, when one joint tenant predeceased the testator the whole estate passed to the survivor. Lockhart v. Vandyke, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 356</cite>, 33 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 613</cite> (1899). This doctrine was changed in 1919 by the enactment of the present statute. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="va_code">152 Va. 677</cite>, 148 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 781</cite> (1929).

         The doctrine of survivorship between joint tenants has been abolished by this section, and the legislature intended to place joint tenants, insofar as dower and curtesy are concerned, in the same situation as tenants in common. Turner v. Turner, <cite class="va_code">185 Va. 505</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 299 (1946); Roane v. Roane, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 18</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 906 (1951).

        <p>
         In Virginia, when real property is conveyed to a husband and wife, the deed must specify that a tenancy by the entirety is intended or a tenancy in common results. In re Manicure, 29 Bankr. 248 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1983).

     And converted into tenancies in common.
    </b>
    - The effect of this section when an estate is conveyed to a husband and wife, is to convert a tenancy by entirety into a tenancy in common and of course to destroy survivorship, but
    
     §
    
    55-21 provides that this section shall not apply when it was manifest from the instrument creating the estate that it was intended that the part of the one dying should then belong to the other. Allen v. Parkey, <cite class="va_code">154 Va. 739</cite>, 149 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 615</cite>, aff'd, <cite class="va_code">154 Va. 749</cite>, 154 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 919</cite> (1930).
        </p>
        <p>
         The deed in question did in fact create a tenancy by the entireties, notwithstanding the lack of language using those specific words, since the intent was conveyed by the language "with the full common law right of survivorship." In re Zella, 196 Bankr. 752 (Bankr. E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 Bankr. 712 (E.D. Va. 1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         A conveyance to husband and wife creates only a tenancy in common, unless it manifestly appears from the tenor of the instrument that it was intended on the part of the one dying that the property in question should then belong to the other. In re Zella, 196 Bankr. 752 (Bankr. E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 Bankr. 712 (E.D. Va. 1996).
        </p>
        <p>
         In Virginia, estates by the entireties are abolished except where the deed or will manifests an intent of survivorship. In re Scialdone, 197 Bankr. 225 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995).

         Manifest means "obvious to the understanding, evident to the mind, not obscure or hidden, and is synonymous with open, clear, visible, unmistakable, indubitable, indisputable, evident and self-evident." In re Scialdone, 197 Bankr. 225 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         It will be observed that partition is not compellable by statute between tenants by entirety, but that end is reached through this section, which makes tenants by entirety tenants in common. Allen v. Parkey, <cite class="va_code">154 Va. 739</cite>, 149 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 615</cite>, aff'd, <cite class="va_code">154 Va. 749</cite>, 154 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 919</cite> (1930).

          Survivor's interest in personal property unclear.
         </b>
         - Although this section had effect of abolishing survivorship between husband and wife with respect to both real and personal property unless an intent to create a survivorship interest was clearly expressed, it does not address the question of whether the resulting survivorship interest is held as joint tenants or as tenants by the entirety. With respect to real property, it is clear that an estate by the entirety is created; but whether the same would be true with respect to personal property is far from clear. In re Massey, 225 Bankr. 887 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1998).

        <p>
         <b>
     The deed which purports to establish a tenancy by the entirety between persons who are not married
    </b>
    to each other creates a joint tenancy; the words of survivorship expressly manifest the requisite intent that the joint tenancy is clothed with the common-law right of survivorship, and, this express manifestation of survivorship necessarily excludes the wife's dower interest. Funches v. Funches, <cite class="va_code">243 Va. 26</cite>, 413 S.E.2d 44 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         The interest of the surviving joint tenant is superior to the dower interest of the wife of the other joint tenant. Funches v. Funches, <cite class="va_code">243 Va. 26</cite>, 413 S.E.2d 44 (1992).

     Reservation by grantor of estate for himself and wife "during the period of their natural lives."
    </b>
    - Since the enactment of this section, changing the common-law doctrine of tenants by entireties, if a husband by his sole deed conveys land excepting from the grant an estate "for and during the period of the natural lives" of himself and wife, each has only a life interest in one moiety of the land. If the exception be treated as a grant, then under the statute they take as tenants in common a moiety each. But in neither event is there any survivorship between them. American Nat'l Bank v. Taylor, <cite class="va_code">112 Va. 1</cite>, 70 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 534</cite> (1911).

    To satisfy this requirement, parties need only use language that passes a simple test, one inherent in the meaning of the word "manifest."

     Termination of entirety estate.

    - Implicit in the terms under which an entirety estate originates is the proposition that the estate can be terminated only by the voluntary action of both tenants or the death of one as a result of a cause reasonably contemplated at the time the tenancy is created. Sundin v. Klein, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 232</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 787 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 452 U.S. 911, 101 S. Ct. 3043, 69 L. Ed. 2d 414 (1981).

         Where one entirety tenant murders the other, the "one person" fiction must give way to the reality that, by his murderous act, the killer has destroyed the unitary nature of the entirety estate and, contrary to his implied agreement, for all practical purposes has terminated the tenancy by a cause of death not contemplated at the time of the original conveyance. While this sort of practical termination may not be sufficient to pass legal title to those claiming under the victim, it would justify limiting the killer's interest for their benefit. Sundin v. Klein, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 232</cite>, 269 S.E.2d 787 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 452 U.S. 911, 101 S. Ct. 3043, 69 L. Ed. 2d 414 (1981).

         Where a bank deposit by a person is in the name of himself and another, not his wife, the presumption is that it was done for the purpose of convenience only, and this presumption is strengthened by the illness or infirmity of the depositor.

          Garnishment.

         - Circuit court erred in dismissing the garnishment because there was no disposition of the property as a disposition involved an act of transferring something to another's care or possession or the relinquishing of property, and the property in the current case was not transferred to the insurer or to anyone else.

        </p>
        <p>
         In a garnishment action, even if the insureds did have the requisite common-law unities, the insurance policy did not create a contractual right held by them with the common-law right of survivorship, an essential attribute of a tenancy by the entirety, as the policy did not use the expression "tenants by the entireties" or "tenants by the entirety"; and it did not state that the insureds held whatever interest they might have with the "right of survivorship" as at common law.

         Attorney's liens.

        - In a case in which an attorney, who had represented the ex-husband in his divorce, sought to enforce his attorney's lien against the property in question, which had been conveyed to the wife and had been held as tenants by the entirety, the attorney unsuccessfully argued that the property converted to a tenancy in common upon the entry of the final decree of divorce and that the lien attached at that time. That argument failed to take into account that notice of the lien was given when the property was still held in tenancy by the entirety so the lien could not attach by the time the recording of the lien took place, and the property was already solely owned by the ex-wife, never having converted to a tenancy in common, and therefore could not be subject to the satisfaction of the attorney's lien.

     Right of legislature to remove disabilities.
    </b>
    - It was entirely competent, for the legislature to remove the disability of married women in whole or in part, and to define her powers with reference to property of all kinds, to ascertain the rights of the husband, if any, therein, and the liability of the property to claims against the wife.

     The effect of this section is to give the wife as full control over her property during the coverture as her husband has over his.
    </b>
    She may sue her husband as if he were a stranger. A husband in Virginia may be a trespasser upon his wife's lands whenever she is not occupying them, if he goes there against her will or her commands; she may prosecute him for criminal trespass; she may dispossess him if he is in possession; or may hold him to account in connection with any transaction with reference to her lands as if he were a stranger. His right to curtesy and his marital rights give him no more power or authority over his wife's property than if he were a total stranger. Edmonds v. Edmonds, <cite class="va_code">139 Va. 652</cite>, 124 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 415</cite> (1924). See Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bennett, <cite class="va_code">197 Va. 216</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 69 (1955).

The language 'nor his marital rights' would seem but to emphasize and clarify, to make certain, the first few lines of the act: 'A married woman shall have the right to acquire, hold, use, control, and dispose of property as if she were unmarried,' etc." Commonwealth v.

     Section gives substantive right to sue husband for tortious damage to property.
    </b>
    - This section gives to the wife full ownership and control of her property, including her choses in action. Her husband is now a stranger to her property and property rights, and she to his. In the ownership and control of their respective properties, their identities are now wholly separate and distinct. Thus the substantive right to sue her husband for tortious damage to her property (as distinguished from a purely personal tort) is furnished by this section. Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bennett, <cite class="va_code">197 Va. 216</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 69 (1955).

    - Section 55-41, relating to the effect to be given to certain conveyances made by married women and the covenants therein contained, does not in any way prohibit her from contracting to sell her statutory separate estate, or inhibit or interfere with a court of equity in the enforcement of such contracts.

     Husband who steals from wife subject to criminal law.
    </b>
    - The broad provisions of the Married Woman's Act, giving the wife absolute control over her tangible personal property, must necessarily bring her within the protective shelter of the criminal laws by making any thief, including her husband, who takes and deprives her of possession and use of her property subject to the usual criminal sanctions. Stewart v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 887</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 329 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the Married Woman's Act would be frustrated if a husband could steal with impunity from his wife. Therefore, he may be prosecuted as any other thief for the larceny of her property. Stewart v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">219 Va. 887</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 329 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a husband could be convicted of larceny of his wife's separate property under
    
     §
    
    55-35, defendant had a good faith belief that he had a claim of right to certain cassette tapes that he took; as a result, the evidence, as found by the trial court, was insufficient to support defendant's conviction. Ward v. Commonwealth, No. 2799-01-3, 2003 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 211</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 8, 2003).

        <p>
         <b>
     Extent of right of husband to use property.
    </b>
    - It is difficult to see how a husband under this section can have any right of occupancy of the wife's real estate unless she resides upon it, and he gets the right of joint occupancy with her then, not because he has any interest in her land, or control over it, or the right to use it, but because as her husband he has the right to the enjoyment of her society. The husband's rights so far as the wife's property is concerned are determined by this section and his occupancy even as a home or use or control thereof are not only not provided for thereby but they are expressly provided against. Edmonds v. Edmonds, <cite class="va_code">139 Va. 652</cite>, 124 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 415</cite> (1924).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          The husband no longer has exclusive possession or control over any portion of property held as tenants by the entireties.
         </b>
         Logic dictates that the same rule should apply to the rents, issues and profits derived from such entirety property. Moore v. Glotzbach, 188 F. Supp. 267 (E.D. Va. 1960).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Notwithstanding this section, the presumption prevails that the husband is the owner
    </b>
    of all property, real and personal, of which the wife may be in possession during coverture, especially if they are living together as husband and wife; and to overcome this presumption, in a contest between the husband's creditors and the wife, she must show affirmatively that the property is her own, and that it was derived from a source other than her husband and in good faith, if he be insolvent. Otherwise, a wide door would be opened to fraud. First Nat'l Bank v. House, <cite class="va_code">145 Va. 149</cite>, 133 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 664</cite> (1926). See Childress v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 191</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 349 (1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not change the presumption that the husband is the owner of all property of which the wife may be in possession during coverture, but the sources from which a wife may accumulate a separate estate are enlarged by it. Thus, while at common law the husband was absolutely entitled to the wife's earnings unless she was a sole trader, under this section the wife may accumulate a separate estate through her earnings. Harris v. Carver, <cite class="va_code">139 Va. 676</cite>, 124 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 206</cite> (1924).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a suit by creditors of an insolvent husband against the wife, the presumption is that every conveyance or transfer of real or personal estate made to the wife, during the coverture, either by her husband or a third person, is founded upon a consideration furnished by the husband, and the burden is upon the wife to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the consideration was in good faith paid by her out of her own estate, and not by her husband. This presumption is based upon the relationship of the parties and exists notwithstanding the emancipation of married women as to their property rights. Johnson v. Ables, <cite class="va_code">119 Va. 593</cite>, 89 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 908</cite> (1916). See Childress v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 191</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 349 (1952).

     This section destroyed the estate of tenancy by the curtesy initiate, but does not affect the husband's estate by the curtesy at his wife's death.
    </b>
    The section only protects the wife's estate during her life, but does not after her death, affect the law of succession as to her real or personal estate. Breeding v.

        </p>
        <p>
         The right of the husband as tenant by marital right and tenant by curtesy initiate have been taken away by the section, and no right by curtesy consummate could accrue after divorce, the latter right being dependent on the death of the wife.

     Rights of husband's creditors.
    </b>
    - Estate by the curtesy consummate exists in the husband in the wife's lands unaliened by her during her lifetime, though devised by her will. Such estate is subject to the liens of the husband's creditors acquired during the coverture, in preference to the general liens of creditors upon her real estate. Browne v. Bockover, <cite class="va_code">84 Va. 424</cite>, 4 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 745</cite> (1888). See Campbell v.

         The right of the husband to recover for loss of domestic services of his wife from one who had tortiously injured her was taken from him and given to the wife by
    
     §
    
    5134 of the Code of 1919, but this did not deprive him of the right to recover for medical expenses made necessary by the injury and paid by him. Nor was its language broad enough to take from him and vest in the wife his right to recover for loss of her consortium as distinguished from the loss of her domestic services. However, the amendment of 1932 (Acts 1932, c. 25, p. 21) broadened and enlarged the scope of this section so that it expressly gave to the wife the right to recover every item of damage incident to her injury, and provided that no action for any element of damage incident to such injury could be maintained by the husband. This prevented the husband from recovering for such medical expenses. Floyd v. Miller, <cite class="va_code">190 Va. 303</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 114 (1950).

     Section construed distributively.
    </b>
    - Chapter 1 of Title 64.1 deals with two very distinct subjects, the descent of real estate and the distribution of personal property. The reference then in this section must be construed distributively, that is to say, when the wife's property consists of real estate it shall pass as real estate passes under that chapter, and when of personal property it passes as personal property passes in that chapter. Hall v. Stewart, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 384</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 469</cite> (1923).

     What property passes.
    </b>
    - Under this section, what passes is not a surplus but the whole of the estate of which the wife dies intestate. Hall v. Stewart, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 384</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 469</cite> (1923).

    - The broad provisions of the Married Woman's Act, giving the wife absolute control over her tangible personal property, must necessarily bring her within the protective shelter of the criminal laws by making any thief, including her husband, who takes and deprives her of possession and use of her property subject to the usual criminal sanctions.

The clerk may refuse to accept any deed submitted for recordation that references the specific portion of any such restrictive covenant. The attorney who prepares or submits a deed for recordation has the responsibility of ensuring that the specific portion of such a restrictive covenant is not specifically referenced in the deed prior to such deed being submitted for recordation. A deed may include a general provision that states that such deed is subject to any and all covenants and restrictions of record; however, such provision shall not apply to the specific portion of a restrictive covenant purporting to restrict the ownership or use of the property as prohibited by subsection A of § 36-96.6. Any deed that is recorded in the land records on or after July 1, 2020, that mistakenly contains such a restrictive covenant shall nevertheless constitute a valid transfer of real property.

         Although
    
     §
    
    55-2 was inapplicable to the conveyance of easements because an easement was not an estate, the circuit court's judgment was reversed; the deeds at issue, along with a plat incorporated therein for descriptive purposes, did not contain operative words manifesting an intention to grant an easement. Considering the particular circumstances of the two deeds and the plat at issue, and resolving any doubt against the establishment of an easement, there was no conveyance of an express easement across the property owner's two parcels for the benefit of the limited liability company's parcel.

      <p>
       In the interpretation of deeds, adopted persons and persons born out of wedlock are included in class gift terminology or terms of relationship in accordance with rules for determining relationships for purposes of intestate succession unless a contrary intent appears on the face of the deed. In determining the intent of a grantor, adopted persons are presumptively included in such terms as "children," "issue," "kindred," "heirs," "relatives," "descendants," or similar words of classification and are presumptively excluded by such terms as "natural children," "issue of the body," "blood kindred," "heirs of the body," "blood relatives," "descendants of the body," or similar words of classification.

      <p>
       The owner of land that is subject to an easement for the purpose of ingress and egress may relocate the easement, on the servient estate, by recording in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city in which the easement or any part of such easement is located, a written agreement evidencing the consent of all affected persons and setting forth the new location of the easement. In the absence of such written agreement, the owner of the land that is subject to such easement may seek relocation of the easement on the servient estate upon petition to the circuit court and notice to all parties in interest. The petition shall be granted if, after a hearing held, the court finds that (i) the relocation will not result in economic damage to the parties in interest, (ii) there will be no undue hardship created by the relocation, and (iii) the easement has been in existence for not less than 10 years.

     Section prevents grantor from denying that title actually passed to grantee.
    </b>
    - This section, a codification of the equitable doctrine of estoppel by deed, operates to prevent the grantor from denying that title has actually passed to the grantee.

    - The lien of a child support judgment docketed after couple's divorce had priority over a recorded deed of trust on entirety property executed solely by the husband prior to the divorce, despite the bank's argument that the entry of the divorce decree, in conjunction with the application of this section (the after-acquired property doctrine), transformed the bank's interest into a viable lien, as the bank's deed of trust with respect to the property was void as to wife and children.

     Application of estoppel by deed.
    </b>
    - Appeals court rejected an argument that the circuit court erred in overruling an LLC's motion in limine that sought to enforce via an estoppel by deed, on grounds that a widow attempted by her evidence to contradict the clear wording of the 1972 deed from which she derived her ownership interest; moreover, the widow was not estopped from claiming that she owned more than a one-half interest in the property and from asserting that she and her decedent husband were not divorced. 1924 Leonard Rd., L.L.C. v.

         Circuit court properly ruled that an ex-wife's deed of trust had priority over a bank's deed of trust because, while the bank's deed of trust was recorded before the ex-wife's deed of trust, the after-acquired-title statute did not purport to affect the deeds of third parties or influence the relative priority of their interests, the bank's deed of trust was void against the ex-wife as a judgment lien creditor, and the bank's deed of trust was not properly recorded in the ex-wife's chain of title.

     Vendor's implied lien was abolished in 1850.
    </b>
    - In 1842, the common-law implied vendor's lien was in existence, it not having been abolished until 1850, and could be enforced against a purchaser for value with notice, either actual or constructive; but, even as between parties, vendors and vendees, it might be waived by taking other securities, or a security of different form. Hunton v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 54</cite>, 43 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 186</cite> (1903).

         <b>
          Object of section was to make lien a matter of record.
         </b>
         - The object of this section in requiring the lien to be reserved on the face of the deed was to make it a matter of record, and thus furnish to all persons dealing with the property the necessary information of all liens and incumbrances thereon. Patton v. Hoge, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 443 (1872); Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186 (1880).
         <br/>

         <b>
          The uncertainty in the state of the law,

         and the perplexing litigation growing out of it, led to the passage of this section. Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186 (1880).

          This section leaves unaffected a lien expressly reserved
         </b>
         upon the face of the conveyance, which lien continues to have the same force and effect it always had. The reason for this is obvious. None of the evils growing out of the vendor's implied lien result from a lien expressly reserved on the face of the conveyance. The lien being set forth in the first link of the vendee's chain of title, purchasers from him have just as much notice of it as they would have of a lien upon the land by deed of trust or mortgage. Patton v. Hoge, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 443 (1872).

     It does not impart any new quality to vendor's lien.
    </b>
    - This section provides that the vendor shall have no lien for unpaid purchase money unless a lien is reserved on the face of the deed, thus abolishing the lien by implication of law and substituting in its place a lien by express contract. This provision was not intended to impart any new quality to the vendor's lien, but to end the vexatious litigation growing out of claims for unpaid purchase money against bona fide purchasers of the legal title. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146 (1872); Gordon v. Rixey, <cite class="va_code">76 Va. 694</cite> (1882); Stoner v.

         <b>
     Express lien is as valid as implied lien formerly was.
    </b>
    - A vendor's lien expressly reserved on the face of a conveyance, as required by this section, is as valid as to the estate or interest in the land conveyed as the implied vendor's lien formerly was, whether the estate in the land conveyed is an absolute fee simple title or a mere equitable interest therein. Dingus v. Minneapolis Imp. Co., <cite class="va_code">98 Va. 737</cite>, 37 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 353</cite> (1900).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Extent of reserved lien depends upon contract.
    </b>
    - The extent of the lien reserved on the face of a deed does not depend upon the extent of the vendor's interest in the land conveyed, but upon the contract of the parties as gathered from the deed itself, in reserving the lien. Patterson v. Grottoes Co., <cite class="va_code">93 Va. 578</cite>, 25 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 602</cite> (1896).

        <p>
         <b>
     It creates no property in land.
    </b>
    - Reserving lien for purchase money creates no property in the land. It passes as personalty. Assigning the debt carries the lien. It binds the land for the purchase money, excluding other claims. Gordon v. Rixey, <cite class="va_code">76 Va. 694</cite> (1882).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Statement not constituting reservation of lien.
    </b>
    - The statement in a deed that it is made "in consideration of five hundred dollars secured to be paid," without more, does not constitute an express reservation of a lien on the land on the face of the deed to secure its payment within the meaning of this section. Harris v. Shield's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">111 Va. 643</cite>, 69 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 933</cite> (1911).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Section does not apply where no conveyance made by vendor.
    </b>
    - The statute abolishing the implied lien has no application, it will be perceived, where no conveyance is made by the vendor. By retaining the legal title the vendor preserves his lien unaffected by this section. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146 (1872); Stoner v. Harris, <cite class="va_code">81 Va. 451</cite> (1886). See Stovall v. Hardy, 1 Va. Dec. 342 (1879).

        <p>
         <b>
          And vendor has lien as long as he retains title.
         </b>
         - In case of a contract to convey, passing equitable title, of course there is a lien, as a vendor has a lien for purchase money as long as he retains title. Yancey v. Mauck, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 300 (1859).
         <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Lien is enforceable against subsequent vendee or lienor.
    </b>
    - If the vendor has sold the legal title, but not conveyed, the land would be charged with the purchase money in the hands of a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, even without notice, and notwithstanding that the vendor had taken personal or other security. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146 (1872); Stoner v. Harris, <cite class="va_code">81 Va. 451</cite> (1886).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          For a court of equity will never compel a vendor to part with the legal title until the purchase money has been paid,
         </b>
         or the lien therefor has been waived or extinguished. Yancey v. Mauck, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 300 (1859); Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186 (1880).

        - The cases cited below were decided under prior law.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         "Principal office."
        </b>
        - Highest bidder at a foreclosure sale was entitled to summary judgment in her action to recover her deposit and the contract and memo of sale were void and unenforceable by either party because the trustee lacked both the capacity and authority to be named or act as substitute trustee where it knew when it was named as substitute trustee and entered into the memo of sale with the bidder that its principal office was not within the Commonwealth of Virginia. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 149 (Westmoreland County Aug. 5, 2013).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Corporate trustee had to have principal office within Commonwealth.
        </b>
        - Actions of a corporate trustee that had its principal office outside Virginia rendered the trustee auction and the memo executed pursuant thereto voidable because the statute required that in order for the trustee to be named or to act as trustee, it had to have its principal office within the Commonwealth; the requirements for a corporation serving as a trustee cannot be read as optional. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Trustee's capacity and authority.
        </b>
        - Bidder's deposit at a foreclosure sale was to be returned to her by a trustee and lender because the memo of sale between the bidder and the trustee was void and unenforceable where the trustee lacked both the capacity and authority to be named or act as substitute trustee, and while the lender was not a party to the memo, it currently held the funds based solely upon its claim to the deposit. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 14 (Westmoreland County Jan. 24, 2014).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Foreign trustee serving with Virginia trustee.
        </b>
        - Mere appointment of a foreign corporation, who did not qualify as a trustee, together with a Virginia corporation as co-trustees did not render two foreclosure sales invalid and, therefore, an exception to a commissioner's report invalidating the sales was sustained since the otherwise qualified co-trustee was a Virginia corporation. In re Trustee's Sale, 67 Va. Cir. 204, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 182 (Norfolk Mar. 25, 2005).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Conclusive presumption.
        </b>
        - Purchaser's claim to set aside the memo by which she bought the property at the trustee sale was not barred by the statute; the conclusive presumption language must be limited to validating the correctness of the residence or business address of the trustee as it appears in the deed of trust. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Breach of contract action.
        </b>
        - Corporate trustee's ground of demurrer that the statute did not create a private cause of action in favor of a defaulting buyer was overruled because although the buyer alleged that the trustee violated the statute, her cause of action was for common-law breach of contract. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013).

        A credit line deed of trust shall set forth on the front page, either in capital letters or in language underscored, the words "THIS IS A CREDIT LINE DEED OF TRUST." Such phrase shall convey notice to all parties that advances or other extensions of credit are to be made or are contemplated to be made from time to time against the security described in the credit line deed of trust.

Such priority shall extend to any advances or other extensions of credit made following the recordation of the credit line deed of trust. Amounts outstanding, together with interest, and other items provided by § 55.1-320, shall continue to have priority until paid or curtailed. Mechanics' liens created under Title 43 shall continue to enjoy the same priority as created by that title.

Such name or address may be changed or modified by duly recorded instrument executed by the beneficiary only. If the note or indebtedness secured by the credit line deed of trust is assigned or transferred, the name and address of the new beneficiary may be set forth in the certificate of transfer provided by § 55.1-336. Such original name or address, or if changed, such changed name or address, shall be the address for delivery of notices contemplated by this section.

      <p>
       Every deed of trust to secure debts or indemnify sureties is in the nature of a contract and shall be construed according to its terms to the extent not in conflict with the requirements of law. Unless the deed of trust provides otherwise, it shall be construed to impose and confer upon the parties and beneficiaries the following duties, rights, and obligations in like manner as if the same were expressly provided for by such deed of trust:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t55.1s0Ic03a02s55.1-320ol11">
        The deed shall be construed as given to secure the performance of each of the covenants entered into by the grantor as well as the payment of the primary obligation.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1s0Ic03a02s55.1-320ol12">
        The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that he will pay all taxes, levies, assessments, and charges upon the property, including the fees and charges of such agents or attorneys as the trustee may deem advisable to employ at any time for the purpose of the trust, so long as any obligation upon the grantor under the deed of trust remains undischarged.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1s0Ic03a02s55.1-320ol13">
        The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that he will keep the improvements on the property in tenantable condition, whether such improvements were on the property when the deed of trust was given or were placed there at a later time.

       <li id="t55.1s0Ic03a02s55.1-320ol14">
        The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that no waste shall be committed or suffered upon the property.

        The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that in the event of his failure to meet any obligations imposed upon him, then the trustee or any beneficiary may, at his option, satisfy such obligations. The money so advanced, with interest as provided in the deed of trust, shall be a part of the debt secured by the deed of trust, in the event of sale to be paid next after the expenses of executing the trust, and shall be otherwise recoverable from the grantor as a debt. In addition, to the extent not otherwise covered, the grantor shall be deemed to covenant that amount advanced or incurred by the trustee or any beneficiary under a deed of trust (i) with respect to an obligation secured by a lien or encumbrance prior to the lien of the deed of trust or (ii) for the protection of the lien secured by the deed of trust, together with interest as provided in the deed of trust, shall be a part of the debt secured by the deed of trust, to be paid next after expenses of executing the trust.

        A covenant to pay interest shall be deemed a covenant to pay interest on the principal balance as such rate may vary or be modified from time to time by the parties under the original instruments or agreements or a written agreement of modification, whether or not recorded, and all the interest on the principal secured by the deed of trust shall be on an equal priority with the principal debt secured by the deed of trust, in the event of sale to be paid next after the expenses of executing the trust.

        In the event of default in the payment of the debt secured, or any part thereof, at maturity, or in the payment of interest when due, or of the breach of any of the covenants entered into or imposed upon the grantor, then at the request of any beneficiary the trustee shall forthwith declare all the debts and obligations secured by the deed of trust at once due and payable and may take possession of the property and proceed to sell the same at auction at the premises or in the front of the circuit court building or at such other place in the county or city in which the property or the greater part thereof lies, or in the corporate limits of any city surrounded by or contiguous to such county, or in the case of annexed land, in the county of which the land was formerly a part, as the trustee may select upon such terms and conditions as the trustee may deem best.

        If the sale is upon credit terms, the deferred purchase money shall bear interest from the day of sale and shall be secured by a deed of trust upon the property contemporaneous with the trustee's deed to the purchaser.

When the instrument of appointment has been executed, the substitute trustee named therein shall be vested with all the powers, rights, authority, and duties vested in the trustee in the original deed of trust. The instrument of appointment shall be recorded in the office of the clerk in which the original deed of trust is recorded prior to or at the time of recordation of any instrument in which a power, right, authority, or duty conferred by the original deed of trust is exercised.

Prior to commencing a foreclosure sale with respect to such real estate, the trustee shall provide copies of such affidavit and notice, with any personal financial information redacted, to each potential bidder.

    - As a deed of trust was a contract under the law, it was clear that plaintiff's claim sounded in contract, not tort; thus, the trial court erred in characterizing the claim was a common-law negligence claim.

         Only statute that addresses the trustee's duties with regard to a foreclosure sale expressly indicates that it does not cover the entire field of duties the trustee has in this area; the statute states that in the event of sale under a deed of trust, the trustee shall have the following powers and duties in addition to all others, and this language clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend to limit a trustee's powers and duties to those enumerated in the statute.

At the time the deed was made, this section did not require a newspaper advertisement, and the statute, as it existed at that time, was expressly referred to, incorporated in and made a part of the deed of trust. It was held that the provisions of this section, as it existed at the time the deed of trust was made, became a material portion of the contract between the parties. Gloucester Realty Corp. v.

         58.1-3340 give real estate taxes a priority over the payment of the proceeds of a foreclosure sale.

         - Upon default in payment of the indebtedness secured by the deed of trust, the secured creditor may accelerate the indebtedness and request the trustee under the deed of trust to execute a sale. The creditor or the trustee must notify the debtor in writing of the acceleration and pending sale. At this point, the trustee holds legal title to the property conveyed in trust and the debtor has an "equity of redemption." This is an equitable right incident to every mortgage which allows the mortgagor to pay the indebtedness and require the secured creditor to reconvey the property free of the deed of trust lien.

     Compensation to trustee of executory trust.

    - A trustee, chosen to hold a legal title as a mere security for debt, with power to sell in case of default, possession to remain with the grantor and not the trustee, is not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of a court of equity to adjudicate his compensation, when he has not been and may never be called upon to execute the trust.

         If the trust had been either partly or completely executed, and the trustee had then invoked the jurisdiction of equity for the settlement of his accounts, or its direction as to the distribution of the trust fund, or the court had acquired jurisdiction over the estate upon any equitable ground, then unquestionably the court would consider and determine the amount of the trustee's compensation for all the services previously rendered.

         The trustee is entitled to compensation whether his services were rendered as attorney or as trustee.

         Substitute trustee.

        - Corporation's deed of trust was inferior to the lien of a partnership's deed of trust because the lien of the partnership deed of trust was not effectively released and was a first lien on a golf course; the partnership had the authority under its deed of trust and subdivision 9 of
        §
        55-59 to substitute trustees. Bristol County Ret. Sys. v. Senior Tour Players Fund I,

        Demurrer filed by the beneficiary of a deed of trust was sustained in a mortgagor's action seeking a declaratory judgment that the foreclosure of her property was unlawful and alleging that the beneficiary did not have authority to appoint a substitute trustee because the deed of trust specifically authorized the beneficiary to appoint a substitute trustee to conduct foreclosure proceedings; when a deed of trust provides otherwise the statutory requirements in
        §
        55-59 are inapplicable. Graves v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., 96 Va. Cir. 457, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 97 (Fairfax County June 29, 2011).

        Deeds of trust permitted a bank to appoint a limited liability company to serve as substitute trustee because there was no language in the deeds of trust indicating that the parties intended otherwise; the statute clearly contemplates that limited liability companies without residences may serve as substitute trustees under deeds of trust.

         No authority to enjoin substitute trustee.
        </b>
        - County board of supervisors was not entitled to enjoin a substitute trustee from foreclosing on an affordable dwelling unit (ADU) because there was no authority under the deed of trust or
        §
        55-59 to enjoin the substitute trustee from selling the property at public auction to the highest bidder when the buyer of the property defaulted. Moreover, nothing in county ordinances or the ADU covenants at the time the property was transferred altered this requirement, as an added covenant and amendment to the ordinances could not be applied retroactively to the buyer.

        - Deed of trust, which granted the holder of a note the power to appoint a trustee or substitute trustee, but did not grant that appointee the ability to appoint an agent or to not be present at the foreclosure sale, also allowed the holder to render said sale voidable.

        <b>
         Duties arose by virtue of contractual relationship.
        </b>
        - Property owners failed to assert a valid claim for negligence against a trustee because the duties of impartiality and ordinary care of a fiduciary the trustee allegedly breached arose by virtue of the parties' contractual relationship under a deed of trust, which constituted a contract under
        §
        55-59, and not the common law; but for the existence of the deed of trust, the trustee would not have owed any fiduciary duties to the owners, and since the trustee had no relationship with the owners absent the deed of trust, any fiduciary duty allegedly breached existed solely because of that contractual relationship.

        - Demurrer filed by a law firm and an attorney was sustained in investors' action alleging legal malpractice because the investors failed to allege any privity between the parties; the deed of trust did not create an attorney-client relationship or a duty to the investors, other than the specific duties set out in the deed of trust and

Written notice shall be given pursuant to clauses (d), (e), and (f) only if the lien is recorded at least 75 days, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 30 days, in the case of all other deeds of trust, prior to the proposed sale. If the secured party has received notification that the owner of the property to be sold is deceased, the notice required by clause (a) shall be given to (1) the last known address of such owner as such address appears in the records of the party secured; (2) any personal representative of the deceased's estate whose appointment is recorded among the records of the circuit court where the property is located, at the address of the personal representative that appears in such records; and (3) any heirs of the deceased who are listed on the list of heirs recorded among the records of the circuit court where the property is located, at the addresses of the heirs that appear in such records.

The written notice of proposed sale when given as provided in this subsection shall be deemed an effective exercise of any right of acceleration contained in such deed of trust or otherwise possessed by the party secured relative to the indebtedness secured.

The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the person required to pay the instrument as reflected in the records of the beneficiary and shall include the name and mailing address of the trustee.

If deemed appropriate by the court, the court may condition the sale on a finding that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

    After providing for written notice to the debtor, this section provides: "Failure to comply with the requirements of notice contained in this section shall not affect the validity of the sale under the deed of trust . . . ." Section 55-59.2, although a part of the same act, contains no such ameliorative language in case of failure to follow its mandatory time periods. It is apparent that the General Assembly intended that different consequences would flow from violations of these respective sections. Deep v.

         <b>
     Purchaser's knowledge of notice to debtor of foreclosure sale.
    </b>
    - It might be difficult for a purchaser at a foreclosure sale to ascertain whether 14 days' personal notice had been given to the debtor as required by this section, and the legislature, undoubtedly for that reason, relieved the purchaser of the consequences of the trustee's failure in that respect. By contrast, a purchaser who has been attracted to a sale by a series of newspaper advertisements has ready means of ascertaining whether the sale falls within the prescribed time period after publication, as required by
    
     §
    
    55-59.2. If the sale falls without that period, he need not bid. Deep v. Rose, <cite class="va_code">234 Va. 631</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 228 (1988).

     Right of acceleration in deed of trust.
    </b>
    - While a notice of a foreclosure sale may act as the exercise of the "right of acceleration" under a deed of trust, subsection A of
    
     §
    
    55-59.1 does not establish a statutory mandate as to whether such "right of acceleration" is in existence and capable of being exercised by the foreclosure notice. Such a determination remains a matter of contract between the parties. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Simmons, <cite class="va_code">275 Va. 114</cite>, 654 S.E.2d 898, 2008 Va. LEXIS 20 (2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where condition precedent for acceleration in deed of trust is not fulfilled, there is no right to accelerate or foreclose. While subsection A of
    
     §
    
    55-59.1 allowed a notice of foreclosure sale to act as an exercise of the right of acceleration, as the holder of mortgage failed to fulfill a contractual condition precedent that would have given it such a right, serving the mortgagor or sending her by certified mail a notice of breach and intent to accelerate, its right to accelerate and to foreclose never matured, and it was liable to the mortgagor for the equity she lost in the foreclosure sale.

          Requisite notice provided.
         </b>
         - Defendant did not fail to provide requisite notice of a foreclosure sale because the notice of sale indicated that it was mailed to plaintiff more than fourteen days prior to the sale pursuant to subsection A of
         §
         55-59.1; the notice of sale was published once a week for two successive weeks as required by the deed of trust, and the foreclosure sale was then held more than eight days following the first advertisement and less than thirty days following the last advertisement, as required by subdivision A 2 of

        </p>

         Defendant's inability to produce the original note did not render a foreclosure sale invalid because the note was freely transferable without prior notice under Virginia law, and plaintiff's claim that a secured party was required to prove its authority or standing to foreclose on the secured property was contrary to the Virginia non-judicial foreclosure laws; by signing the deed of trust, plaintiff specifically acknowledged that "the note or a partial interest in the note (together with the security instrument) could be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower."

III injury failed to the extent "standing" was used to refer to the requirement that a secured party first prove in court its right to initiate a foreclosure before the procedure commences, because Virginia, the state in which the foreclosure took place, was a non-judicial foreclosure state with such foreclosures being governed by the procedures and requirements of

    - It might be difficult for a purchaser at a foreclosure sale to ascertain whether 14 days' personal notice had been given to the debtor as required by
    
     §
    
    55-59.1, and the legislature, undoubtedly for that reason, relieved the purchaser of the consequences of the trustee's failure in that respect. By contrast, a purchaser who has been attracted to a sale by a series of newspaper advertisements has ready means of ascertaining whether the sale falls within the prescribed time period after publication, as required by
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    55-59.2. If the sale falls without that period, he need not bid. Deep v. Rose, <cite class="va_code">234 Va. 631</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 228 (1988).

     Duty to give public notice of sale is contractual and statutory.
    </b>
    - Deed of trust expressly set out the amount of advertising that must precede the foreclosure sale, and the minimum amount of advertising necessary under the deed of trust mirrored the minimum requirements stated in the statute, plus the contents of the advertisements were governed by
    
     §

     Minimum and maximum periods between advertisement and sale are mandatory.
    </b>
    - It is apparent from the language of this section, that the 8-day minimum and 30-day maximum periods between advertisement and sale are intended to be mandatory, overriding both the discretion of the trustee and the contractual terms adopted by the parties to the deed of trust. In this crucial respect, the statute before us differs from all its predecessors. Deep v. Rose, <cite class="va_code">234 Va. 631</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 228 (1988).

    - Trustee's advertisement of sale under deed of trust gave adequate notice to debtor and any potential 3rd-party bidder that both real and personal property would be sold as part of the foreclosure, where the notes and deed of trust clearly made reference to real and personal property as collateral for the loan and where the advertisement referred to the deed of trust for a description of the property to be sold and expressly stated that the personal property would be conveyed by the bill of sale.

         District court did not err in concluding that the advertisement relative to a property substantially complied with

       Whenever the grantor, or his successor in title, in any deed of trust by which any real property is conveyed in trust to secure debts or indemnify sureties dies prior to a trustee's sale held pursuant to the deed of trust and the deed of trust contains no definite provision for the distribution of any surplus in the event of the death of the grantor or his successors in title prior to the trustee's sale held pursuant to the deed of trust, or contains a provision that such surplus shall be paid to the grantor or his heirs or assigns or personal representative, then any surplus of the proceeds of the sale remaining in the possession of the trustee, after discharging the expenses of executing the trust, all tax liens upon the property sold, all debts and obligations secured by the deed of trust, and, in order of their priority, if any, the remaining subsequent debts and obligations secured by the deed, and any liens of record inferior to the deed of trust under which the sale is made, with lawful interest, shall be paid by the trustee to the personal representative of the decedent.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Any such funds possessed by the personal representative shall constitute assets for the payment by him of any debts and demands against the decedent's estate remaining unsatisfied after the personal estate has been exhausted. Any surplus of the funds so paid to the personal representative and remaining in his possession after the satisfaction of all debts and demands against the estate shall be paid over by him, if the decedent died intestate as to the real property embraced in the deed of trust, to the heirs at law of the decedent, or their successors in title, and if the decedent died testate as to the real property embraced in the deed of trust, then such surplus shall be paid to the persons entitled to the real property under the terms of the decedent's will, or to their successors in title.

      <p>
       Whenever any assignee of an installment note secured by a security interest on a manufactured home determines that legal action is desirable to enforce the debt resulting in a potential foreclosure or repossession, he shall give prior notice by mail of any action to foreclose or repossess the collateral to any assignor who is liable under a recourse endorsement or by virtue of a reserve account at least 10 business days prior to the enforcement of the security interest or eviction. Assignment by way of pledge of the security interest granted by the assignor shall not be an assignment within the meaning of this section. The failure to so notify the assignor shall not affect any rights of the assignee as against the principal debtor or any party other than the assignor with recourse or a person with rights in a reserve account. Provisions of this section may not be waived by such assignor at the time of the original sale of the installment paper but only after the expiration of at least 30 days from such initial transfer. The assignee shall send such notice to the last known address of the assignor as it appears in the records of the assignee.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       1. The settlement agent identified below has paid the obligation secured by the deed of trust described herein or obtained written confirmation from you that such obligation has a zero balance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2. The undersigned will release the deed of trust described in this notice unless, within 90 days from the date this notice is mailed by certified mail or commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, the undersigned has received by certified mail or commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, a notice stating that a release of the deed of trust has been recorded in the clerk's office or that the obligation secured by the deed of trust described herein has not been paid, or the lien creditor or servicer otherwise objects to the release of the deed of trust. Notice shall be sent to the address stated on this form.

       (Virginia RESA registration number of settlement agent at the time the obligation was paid or confirmed to have a zero balance)
       <br/>
       <br/>
       2. Certificate of satisfaction and affidavit of settlement agent or title insurance company.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       a. If, within 90 days following the day on which the settlement agent or title insurance company mailed or delivered the notice of intent to release in accordance with this subsection, the lien creditor or servicer does not send by certified mail or commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, to the settlement agent or title insurance company a notice stating that a release of the deed of trust has been recorded in the clerk's office or that the obligation secured by the deed of trust has not been paid in full or that the lien creditor or servicer otherwise objects to the release of the deed of trust, the settlement agent or title insurance company may execute, acknowledge, and file with the clerk of court of the jurisdiction in which the deed of trust is recorded a certificate of satisfaction, which shall include (i) the affidavit described in subdivision 2 b and (ii) a copy of the notice of intent to release that was sent to the lender, the servicer, or both. The certificate of satisfaction shall include the settlement agent's RESA registration number, issued by the Virginia State Bar or the Virginia State Corporation Commission, that was in effect at the time the settlement agent paid the obligation secured by the deed of trust or obtained written confirmation from the lien creditor that such obligation has a zero balance. The certificate of satisfaction shall note that the individual executing the certificate of satisfaction is doing so pursuant to the authority granted by this subsection. After filing or recording the certificate of satisfaction, the settlement agent or title insurance company shall mail a copy of the certificate of satisfaction to the lien creditor or servicer. The validity of a certificate of satisfaction otherwise satisfying the requirements of this subsection shall not be affected by the inaccuracy of the RESA registration number placed thereon or the failure to mail a copy of the recorded certificate of satisfaction to the lien creditor or servicer and shall nevertheless release the deed of trust described therein as provided in this subsection.
       <br/>

The affidavit shall be substantially in the following form:

       3. Effect of filing.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When filed or recorded with the clerk's office, a certificate of satisfaction that is executed and notarized as provided in this subsection and accompanied by (i) the affidavit described in subdivision 2 b and (ii) a copy of the notice of intent to release that was sent to the lender, lien creditor, or servicer shall operate as a release of the encumbrance described therein and, if the encumbrance is by deed of trust, as a reconveyance of the legal title as fully and effectively as if such certificate of satisfaction were a formal deed of release duly executed and recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. Effect of wrongful or erroneous certificate; damages.
      </p>
      <p>
       a. The execution and filing or recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction by a settlement agent or title insurance agent does not relieve the party obligated to repay the debt, or anyone succeeding to or assuming the responsibility of the obligated party as to the debt, from any liability for the debt or other obligations secured by the deed of trust that is the subject of the wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. A settlement agent or title insurance agent that wrongfully or erroneously executes and files or records a certificate of satisfaction is liable to the lien creditor for actual damages sustained due to the recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       5. Applicability.
      </p>
      <p>
       a. The procedure authorized by this subsection for the release of a deed of trust may be used to effect the release of a deed of trust after July 1, 2002, regardless of when the deed of trust was created, assigned, or satisfied by payment made by the settlement agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. This subsection applies only to transactions involving the purchase of or lending on the security of real estate located in the Commonwealth that is either (i) unimproved real estate with a lien to be released of $1 million or less or (ii) real estate containing at least one but not more than four residential dwelling units.
      </p>
      <p>
       c. The procedure authorized by this subsection applies only to the full and complete release of a deed of trust. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the partial release of property from a deed of trust or otherwise permit the execution or recordation of a certificate of partial satisfaction.

     Requisites for release.
    </b>
    - In order to obtain a release under this section there must be a concurrence of two separate and distinct acts: (1) The lien creditor must cause the payment or satisfaction to be entered on the margin of the page of the book where the encumbrance is recorded, signed by the creditor, or his duly authorized agent or attorney; and (2) the evidence of debt, duly canceled, must be produced before the clerk, or an affidavit filed with the clerk that the debt has been paid and the evidence of debt canceled or lost or destroyed. Waynesboro Nat'l Bank v. Smith, <cite class="va_code">151 Va. 481</cite>, 145 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 302</cite> (1928).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although a certificate of release of deed of trust executed by a noteholder with respect to a debtor's property did not literally follow any of the statutory forms in
         §
         55-66.4:1, the court had little difficulty in concluding that the certificate, even though omitting the word "partial" in its title, did not release the deed of trust in its entirety but only as to the debtor's other property. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Trust Co., N.A. v. Botero-Paramo (In re Botero-Paramo), 445 Bankr. 530, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 447 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         While defendant creditor's release of a refinancing deed of trust did not comply exactly with either a "Certificate of Satisfaction" or a "Certificate of Partial Satisfaction" under
         §
         55-66.3, its plain language showed it applied only to a lien against one property, and because it was recorded earlier than plaintiff creditor's lien, it had priority on the other property. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Trust Co., N.A. v. Tysons Fin., LLC
    (In re Botero-Paramo), 483 Fed. Appx. 779, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 11688 (4th Cir. 2012).

     Effect of payment by insurance company of debt secured.
    </b>
    - The fact that an insurance company discharged its liability to a mortgagee by paying off the debt secured and became subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee, but denied liability to the mortgagor, does not show such a discharge under this section as to sustain a cancellation of the deed of trust. Wagner v. Peters, <cite class="va_code">142 Va. 412</cite>, 128 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 445</cite> (1925). See note to this case under

        <p>
         <b>
          Guarantors not released.
         </b>
         - Certificate of satisfaction did not release guarantors as a matter of Virginia law in the bank's action to collect on a deficiency judgment because the guaranties specifically provided that the release of any property connected to the debt was not a release of the guarantors' obligations. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Zarrabi, 560 Fed. Appx. 181, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 4407 (4th Cir. 2014).

          Statute of limitations.
         </b>
         - Claim based on creditor's failure to timely release a lien against a consumer's residence after the underlying debt obligation was satisfied was barred by the statute of limitations, since the limitations period began to run when the creditor failed to file a certificate of satisfaction within the statutory period after payment rather than when the consumer demanded that the creditor record a certificate of satisfaction.

      </p>
      <p>
       a. The execution and filing or recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction by a settlement agent or title insurance agent does not relieve the party obligated to repay the debt, or anyone succeeding to or assuming the responsibility of the obligated party as to the debt, from any liability for the debt or other obligations secured by the deed of trust or judgment lien that is the subject of the wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. A settlement agent or title insurance agent that wrongfully or erroneously executes and files or records a certificate of satisfaction is liable to the lien creditor for actual damages sustained due to the recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of satisfaction.

       5. Applicability.

      <p>
       a. The procedure authorized by this subsection for the release of a deed of trust may be used to effect the release of a deed of trust after July 1, 2002, regardless of when the deed of trust was created, assigned, or satisfied by payment made by the settlement agent. The procedure authorized by this subsection for the release of a judgment lien may be used to effect the release of such judgment lien after July 1, 2021, regardless of when the judgment lien was created, assigned, or satisfied by payment made by the settlement agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. This subsection applies only to transactions involving the purchase of or lending on the security of real estate located in the Commonwealth that is either (i) unimproved real estate with a lien to be released of $1 million or less or (ii) real estate containing at least one but not more than four residential dwelling units.
      </p>
      <p>
       c. The procedure authorized by this subsection applies only to the full and complete release of a deed of trust or judgment lien. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the partial release of property from a deed of trust or judgment lien or otherwise permit the execution or recordation of a certificate of partial satisfaction.

Such certificate of partial satisfaction may be accomplished in manner and form prescribed in this chapter for making certificates of satisfaction, except that the creditor, or his duly authorized agent, shall make an affidavit to the clerk or in such certificate that such creditor is at the time of making such satisfaction the legal holder of the obligation, note, bond, or other evidence of debt, secured by such lien, and when made in conformity with the provisions of this chapter such partial satisfaction shall be as valid and binding as a proper release deed duly executed for the same purpose.

Such warranties are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other express or implied warranties pertaining to the dwelling or its materials or fixtures. A contract for sale may waive, modify, or exclude any or all express and implied warranties and sell a new home "as is" only if the words used to waive, modify, or exclude such warranties are conspicuous, as defined by subdivision (b)(10) of § 8.1A-201, set forth on the face of such contract in capital letters that are at least two points larger than the other type in the contract and only if the words used to waive, modify, or exclude the warranties state with specificity the warranty or warranties that are being waived, modified, or excluded.

Such notice also may be hand delivered to the vendor with the vendee retaining a receipt of such hand-delivered notice to the vendor or its authorized agent.

        - Home purchasers stated a cause of action against the corporate president as they adequately alleged that the corporate president's joint venture constructed the new home of the home purchasers, and, as a result, an implied warranty existed that the home was free from structural defects and built in a workmanlike manner; conversely, the home purchasers did not state a cause of action with regard to the individual and the construction company because the applicable statute required the cause of action be brought against a vendor of the new home and neither of them was a vendor, which meant their demurrer against the home purchasers' complaint as to the breach of warranty claim against them had to be granted.

         Waiver.

        - Contract provision was ineffective to waive the implied warranties in the sale of a new home, as the font size of the warranty waiver text - which was capitalized - was not two points larger than the remainder of the contract. Speier v. Renaissance at Victoria Farms, 58 Va. Cir. 90, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 365 (Fairfax County 2001).

        Because the buyers of a modular home, considered a "good" under the Virginia Uniform Commercial Code, could not maintain an action as if their contract was one for the sale of real property, and even if

        In multiple actions involving allegedly defective Chinese drywall, demurrers to claims under the statutory warranty provided in

       <p>
        Purported rent-to-own buyer of a residential property was not entitled to relief under the statutory new home warranties because, as alleged in the complaint, the buyer was not a vendee, but rather a tenant, when the buyer took possession of the property pursuant to the terms of a lease rather than the sales contract. Accordingly, the new home warranties, which were for the exclusive benefit of a vendee, were not applicable to the buyer. Davis v. Randolph Williams at Goose Creek, LLC,, 2020 Va. Cir.

    - Where certain deeds contained no reference to antecedent contracts reserving possession in the vendor, but contained the usual covenant, whereby, under this section, grantees were given, in praesenti, the right to enter, receive the rents and enjoy the premises without interruption and free from encumbrance, as the stipulations in the contracts of sale and the covenants in the deeds were in irreconcilable conflict on the question of possession, the antecedent contracts were merged in the deeds, and the vendees were entitled to possession.

     Effect of covenant in contract to sell land.
    </b>
    - A vendor in a contract for the sale of land covenanted that on payment of the first installment of the purchase price he would make title in fee, and, by such conveyances as the grantees or their counsel might reasonably require, convey and release the land in possession to the grantees, free of encumbrances or demands. It was held that, the covenant being in the usual form for a covenant for "further assurances" in respect to an accepted title, its meaning was that a deed with proper covenants would be made, conveying the premises in question, and it did not constitute the grantees' satisfaction with the title necessary as a condition precedent to make the acceptance of the deed obligatory on them.

         <b>
     Bona fide preference is valid.
    </b>
    - Save so far as prohibited by the federal Bankruptcy Act, neither at common law nor in Virginia is it immoral or illegal to prefer one creditor to another in a deed of assignment, neither having any lien, provided there is no design to secure some fraudulent or illegal pecuniary advantage or benefit therefrom to the debtor himself. Hutcheson v. Savings Bank, <cite class="va_code">129 Va. 281</cite>, 105 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 677</cite> (1921). See Johnson v. Lucas, <cite class="va_code">103 Va. 36</cite>, 48 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 497</cite> (1904).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under this section it is well settled that an insolvent debtor, known by himself at the time to be insolvent, may make a valid conveyance of a portion or the whole of his assets to a bona fide creditor or creditors, in satisfaction or on account of existing indebtedness, if that is the sole purpose of the debtor, and the transfer is for full value, although such conveyance may and is intended by the grantor and grantee or grantees to give such creditor or creditors a preference to the exclusion of others in the distribution of the assets of the debtor. Surratt v. Eskridge, <cite class="va_code">131 Va. 325</cite>, 108 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 677</cite> (1921).
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all preferential transfers are invalid. At common law and under this section, an insolvent debtor may generally make a valid transfer of a portion or the whole of his assets to a bona fide creditor on account of an existing indebtedness, if that is the sole purpose of the debtor and the transfer is for full value. This is true even though such transfer may and is intended by the debtor and creditor to give such creditor a preference to the exclusion of others in the distribution of the debtor's assets. This rule applies to corporations which are not banks or trust companies. Bank of Commerce v. Rosemary &amp; Thyme, Inc., <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 781</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 909 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Preferential transfers for full value to bona fide creditors by an insolvent debtor are not invalid absent fraud. It follows, as a corollary, that successful efforts by such creditors to receive preferential treatment from an insolvent debtor will not be invalidated unless fraud is established. S.W. Rawls, Inc. v. Forrest, <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 264</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 791 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, an insolvent debtor, whether an individual or a corporation, may prefer some bona fide creditors to the exclusion of others. Absent clear and convincing proof that a debtor made the preference with intent to defraud the other creditors and that the preferred creditor had notice thereof, the unpaid creditors cannot successfully attack the preference as a fraudulent conveyance under this section. Mills v. Miller Harness Co., <cite class="va_code">229 Va. 155</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 665 (1985).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     But if the purpose to make a bona fide preference is merely incidental to the transaction
    </b>
    and is used as a cloak for some other purpose which is fraudulent in actual intent, the transfer is invalid. Bank of Commerce v. Rosemary &amp; Thyme, Inc., <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 781</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 909 (1978).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     To prefer one creditor to another, neither having any lien, is not in contravention of any rule
    </b>
    of law in this State. Until there is a legal lien by judgment or execution fixed upon a debtor's property, he may, though in failing circumstances, assign his estate in trust; and if it be done in good faith, he may thereby prefer one creditor to another, without committing a fraud, within this section, upon the creditors who are delayed and hindered. Nor is it an objection that the conveyance defeats all other creditors of their legal remedies, though they may amount to a majority in number and value. Young v. Willis, <cite class="va_code">82 Va. 291</cite> (1886).

     But directors of corporation may not grant themselves preference over other creditors.
    </b>
    - The weight of authority seems to be that the directors of an insolvent corporation, who are also creditors of the corporation, have no right to grant themselves a preference or an advantage over other creditors in the payment of their claims. This rule is based upon simple justice. Darden v. George G. Lee Co., <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 108</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 897 (1963), commented on in 21 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 353 (1964).

         <b>
     And preference to creditor-director in control of insolvent corporation is void.
    </b>
    - A preferential transfer by an insolvent corporation was void under this section where the preferred creditor owned half of the corporation's stock, was a director and secretary-treasurer of the corporation, and plainly was in complete control of the corporation's affairs. Darden v. George G. Lee Co., <cite class="va_code">204 Va. 108</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 897 (1963), commented on in 21 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 353 (1964).

          Where principal shareholders exercised complete control over the affairs of corporation and consequently transferred corporate assets to themselves

         in violation of this section, the appropriate remedy in such a situation was to return the fraudulently conveyed assets for a ratable distribution to all legitimate creditors, which might include the recipient of the fraudulent conveyance and the principal shareholders, as legitimate creditors of the corporation were entitled to share in the distribution of the bankrupt's estate, after they returned the fraudulently conveyed assets, or their value, to the estate.

It is sufficient if he has knowledge of such facts and circumstances as would have excited the suspicion of a man of ordinary care and prudence, and put him upon such inquiry as to the bona fides of the transaction as would necessarily have led to the discovery of the fraud of the grantor or seller.

    - The maxim, "Fraud must be proven and is never to be presumed," is true only when understood as affirming that a contract or conduct apparently honest and lawful must be regarded as such, until shown to be otherwise by evidence, either positive or circumstantial; but fraud may be inferred from facts calculated to establish it; and fraud should be so inferred when the facts and circumstances are such as to lead a reasonable man to the conclusion that a debtor has attempted to withdraw his property from the reach of his creditors, with the intent to prevent them from recovering their just debts; and if such fraudulent intent is thus established prima facie, it must be regarded as conclusively established unless it is rebutted by facts and circumstances which are proven.

        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
          What constitute badges of fraud.
         </b>
         - The badges of fraud have been stated to include: (1) retention of an interest in the transferred property by the transferor; (2) transfer between family members for allegedly antecedent debt; (3) pursuit of the transferor or threat of litigation by his creditors at the time of the transfer; (4) lack of or gross inadequacy of consideration for the conveyance; (5) retention or possession of the property by transferor; and (6) fraudulent incurrence of indebtedness after the conveyance. Hyman v. Porter, 37 Bankr. 56 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circumstances indicative of fraud are sometimes designated as badges thereof. As summarized these are: (1) the relationship of the parties; (2) the grantor's insolvency; (3) pursuit of him by his creditors at the time; (4) want of consideration; (5) retention of possession of the property by the grantor; and (6) fraudulent incurrence of indebtedness after the conveyance. Hutcheson v. Savings Bank, <cite class="va_code">129 Va. 281</cite>, 105 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 677</cite> (1921); Bartl v. Garfinkel (In re Claxton), 30 Bankr. 199 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         To come within the scope of this section, the transfer or act assailed must be done with intent to hinder, delay or defraud. Because of the difficulty of establishing "actual intent," evidence of fraud may be, and generally must be, circumstantial. Consequently, without differentiating between delaying, hindering or defrauding, courts have relied historically upon presumptions of fraud, known also as "badges of fraud," which consist of facts and circumstances which the law admits to be the signs of fraud; and from which the fraudulent intent may be inferred. Hyman v. Porter, 37 Bankr. 56 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain facts are indicia of fraud, such as the relationship of the parties, the insolvency of the debtor, the consideration or lack of consideration for the transfer, and retention of the benefits of the transferred property, among others. Wick v. Yost, 47 Bankr. 697 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of difficulty of proving actual intent, courts have relied on presumptions, or "badges," of fraud. From the existence of certain circumstances, fraudulent intent may legitimately be inferred. These circumstances are, among others, (1) the close relationship of the parties, (2) the grantor's insolvency, (3) pursuit of the grantor by creditors at the time of the transfer, (4) inadequate consideration, and (5) retention of possession of the property by the grantor. Armstrong v. United States, 7 F. Supp. 2d 758 (W.D. Va. 1998).

          Badge of fraud establishes prima facie case.
         </b>
         - The party seeking to avoid a fraudulent conveyance may shift the burden of proof by establishing a prima facie case of fraud. Moreover, a prima facie case is established by demonstrating a badge of fraud. Hyman v. Porter, 37 Bankr. 56 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).

         - Where in the month prior to its filing for bankruptcy the debtor made a $70,000 contribution to the retirement plan, where this contribution was twice as large as any other contribution to the plan, and where five days before such contribution, the debtor's unaudited balance sheet indicated a negative cash balance of $69,376.23, debtor failed to rebut the bankruptcy trustee's prima facie case for fraud.

        </p>
        <p>
         Transfers from a debtor corporation to the co-owners of the corporation were fraudulent conveyances because the co-owners removed funds from the debtor corporation for their personal use before the debtor corporation completed a construction project, which caused a gross disparity between the value of the work performed and the payments made on the project.

          Effect of badges of fraud.
         </b>
         - In the absence of direct and positive testimony, there are many facts and circumstances which the law admits to be the marks or signs of fraud; and from which, therefore, the fraudulent intent may be inferred. Some of these circumstances afford only prima facie evidence of it; but others afford conclusive evidence and establish it decisively. Land v. Jeffries, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 599 (1827).

     Insolvency of debtor is not conclusive evidence of fraud.

         It is well settled that conveyances professedly to indemnify creditors, but expressly or impliedly reserving to the grantors powers inconsistent with and adequate to defeat such purpose, are void as to creditors and purchasers. Garland v. Rives, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 282 (1826).
        </p>
        <p>
         To reserve any benefit to the grantor himself, or to introduce limitations and contingencies such as will give him such control over the property or to its proceeds as to enable him in effect to defeat the conveyance, or if the deed contains a power, in any way equivalent in its effects to a power of revocation, reservations to the grantor made expressly or reserved impliedly, inconsistent with and adequate to defeat the declared purpose, will be fatal to the conveyance.

         That the reservation of an interest in the property, by postponing the time of sale, or directing a sale on credit, or providing for the payment of the surplus after satisfying the creditors secured, do not of themselves furnish evidence of fraudulent intent, has been affirmed by the repeated decisions of the Virginia courts.

     Grantor remaining in possession.

    - One of the badges whereby a fraudulent intent may be discovered is the circumstance that the grantor remains in possession of the granted property; yet the retention of possession of the property may be provided for in the conveyance, and be consistent with its terms and objects.

        <p>
         It is true that in the most natural and usual course of things a fair purchaser desires and obtains the possession of the property, and, hence, its being retained by the grantor gives rise to a suspicion of fraud, such as, in view of the frequent arts and contrivances against the rights of creditors, warrants a presumption against the fairness of the transaction, requiring full and satisfactory explanation; a presumption which cannot be too strongly stated, to the effect of throwing the whole burden of proving the genuineness and sufficiency of the consideration upon the grantee, and in the naked case of an alleged absolute sale, and possession notwithstanding retained, requiring the conclusion of fraud. But there is no sound principle upon which the mere nondelivery of possession can be treated as conclusive against the fairness and good faith of the contract. Davis v. Turner, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 422 (1848). See also Dance v. Seaman, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 778 (1854).

        - Creditor's complaint alleged sufficient facts to state a valid cause of action for fraudulent conveyance because the creditor explicitly identified the agents of fraud by listing the companies, a purchaser and a debtor, that allegedly engaged in the fraud, and a "man of ordinary care and prudence" would have concluded that purchasing all the assets of a limited liability company would infringe on the creditor's contractual right to first refusal for the debtor; since the purchaser likely knew that the debtor controlled and owned all of the limited liability company's assets, and the debtor owned no other significant assets, the purchaser knew, or should have known, that it was in fact purchasing the debtor.

          Purpose of section.
         </b>
         - This section was intended to defeat frauds perpetrated upon existing creditors by the marriage of an insolvent debtor, accompanied by gifts to his wife. Hyman v. Porter, 37 Bankr. 56 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984).

         <b>
     Presumed fraudulent.
    </b>
    - Transactions between husband and wife, as a matter of public policy, are presumed to be fraudulent, because of the temptation to commit frauds upon creditors and the ease with which they may be perpetrated, and this presumption must be overcome by evidence. Where a husband who is indebted conveys his property to his wife, the wife must prove the good faith of the transaction by clear and satisfactory evidence, and if the deed is tainted with actual fraud, it is void as to all creditors, whether existing or subsequent. Morrisette v. Cook &amp; Bernheimer Co., <cite class="va_code">122 Va. 588</cite>, 95 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 449</cite> (1918). See also Hughson v.

     Determining kind of conveyance.
    </b>
    - The rule that transactions between husband and wife must be closely scrutinized and that the burden is upon the wife to show by clear and satisfactory evidence the bona fides of the transaction does not apply to a mere voluntary conveyance, such transfer being governed by the principles incorporated in this section. But the rule is used to determine the kind of conveyance that is under investigation. Morriss v. Bronson, <cite class="va_code">170 Va. 516</cite>, 197 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 479</cite> (1938).

          Postnuptial settlement for fair consideration is good.
         </b>
         - That a postnuptial settlement in favor of a wife, made in pursuance of a previous fair contract for a fair consideration, will be held good, is a doctrine supported by abundant authority. Penn v. Whitehead, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 503 (1867).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     But every such settlement is presumed to be voluntary.
    </b>
    - Every postnuptial settlement will be taken as voluntary, unless those claiming under it can show that it was made for a valuable consideration, and this cannot be shown either by the answer or by the recitals in the deed, but must be established by legal evidence. Hatcher v. Crews, <cite class="va_code">78 Va. 460</cite> (1884); Lewis v. Mason's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">84 Va. 731</cite>, 10 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 529</cite> (1888); Morrisette v.

     Conveyance by husband was void as to wife.
    </b>
    - Where conveyance of money by husband to corporation owned by person he was living with was made as an inducement for person to terminate her marriage, such consideration was not deemed valuable at law because it was contrary to public policy, and thus wife whom husband owed support payments was a creditor of the husband at the time of the conveyance and because it was a voluntary conveyance, it was void as to the wife.

        </p>
        <p>
         Gift of a husband to his wife of his interest in the proceeds from the sale of real property that they owned as tenants by the entireties was not fraud as to the rights of the husband's creditor because the creditor was not prejudiced by a gift of property that was exempt from their claims. The gift was not void under

         - The great weight of authority approves the principle that a debtor, even though insolvent, has committed no fraud in law or in fact by giving his labor away, for by so doing he has not concealed, withheld or disposed of anything on which his creditors have any claim in law or in equity; and, generally, this rule applies with equal force although the relationship of the debtor and his employer is that of husband and wife. Virginia has adopted this view, and early cases to the contrary have been impliedly overruled. Studds v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., 267 F.2d 875 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 876, 80 S.

    - Transactions which are condemned by
    
     §
    
    55-80 may be impeached by both prior and subsequent creditors, while such as are included in this section can only be set aside at the suit of existing creditors. Section 55-80 deals with fraudulent acts that are void, and, therefore, its operation is not limited to any particular class of creditors. It applies alike to all creditors who are delayed, hindered or defrauded of their rights by the device of the grantor, whether they be existing or subsequent creditors. On the other hand, this section deals with gifts, conveyances, etc., that are voluntary, or upon consideration of marriage, which are only declared to be void as to "creditors whose debts shall have been contracted at the time it was made, but shall not, on that account merely, be void as to creditors whose debts shall have been contracted . . . after it was made."

         The rule seems settled that in respect to after-existing creditors a fraudulent deed differs from one that is merely void because not upon a consideration deemed valuable in law, in that the former is void as to such creditors, as well as those whose debts were created after the deed was made; while the latter is only void as to antecedent debts, and may be wholly sustained as to those coming in existence after its date.

      </h3>
      <p>
       Before obtaining a judgment for his claim, a creditor may, whether such claim is due and payable or not, institute any action that he may institute after obtaining such judgment to avoid a gift, conveyance, assignment, or transfer of, or charge upon, the estate of his debtor declared void by either § 55.1-400 or 55.1-401. Such creditor may, in such action, have all the relief with respect to such estate to which he would be entitled after obtaining a judgment for the claim for which he may be entitled to recover. A creditor availing himself of this section shall have a lien from the time of bringing his action on all the estate, real and personal, and a petitioning creditor shall also be entitled to a lien from the time of filing his petition in the court in which the action is brought. If the proceeds of sale are insufficient to satisfy the claims of all the creditors whose liens were acquired at the same time, they shall be applied proportionately to such claims, and the court may issue an order against the debtor for any deficiency remaining on the claim of any creditor after applying his share of the proceeds of sale, or, if any creditor is not entitled to share in such proceeds, may issue an order against the debtor for the full amount of the creditor's claim.

     Creditor may sue under this section without first obtaining judgment.
    </b>
    - As the law was before this section a creditor could not attack a conveyance for fraud without first obtaining a judgment or decree against his debtor. This section, which originated in the Code of 1849, changed this rule and authorized a creditor at large to institute such a suit without first obtaining judgment. Wallace's Adm'r v. Treakle, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 479 (1876); Johnston v. Straus, 26 F. 57 (E.D. Va. 1882); Trimble v. Covington Grocery Co., <cite class="va_code">112 Va. 826</cite>, 72 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 724</cite> (1911); Wood v.

        </p>
        <p>
         This section allows a bill to be filed by a creditor to set aside a conveyance, etc., declared void by
    
     §§
    
    55-80 and 55-81, before obtaining judgment or decree, upon the ground that the above sections refer to fraudulent acts that are void. Brown v. Putney, <cite class="va_code">90 Va. 447</cite>, 18 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 883</cite> (1894).

    - This section was intended to benefit those creditors who, by their diligence, succeed in bringing into court for distribution a fund, or assets placed beyond the reach of the unsecured creditors by the fraudulent or voluntary act of the debtor, and such creditors as attack the fraudulent or voluntary act and succeed in subjecting such fund or assets. But the lien provided for is never perfected unless and until the deed or other act of the debtor attacked is adjudicated to be fraudulent and void. If there is no such adjudication, the lien is inchoate and ineffectual. Quinn-Marshall Co. v. Whittaker, <cite class="va_code">116 Va. 965</cite>, 83 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 398</cite> (1914).

    - A creditor who successfully assails a deed of trust on the ground that it secures a fraudulent debt is not entitled to be substituted to the position formerly occupied by the fraudulent creditor. His lien, if not previously acquired, dates only from the commencement of his suit, and is subordinate to liens previously acquired. The deed is valid as to bona fide debts, and the fraudulent debt is eliminated. Craig v. Hoge, <cite class="va_code">95 Va. 275</cite>, 28 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 317</cite> (1897).

    - If from any cause the result of the suit prove unavailing to any creditor united therein, the court may render a personal decree against the debtor for the amount of the creditor's claim. This feature of this section is remedial and should be liberally construed, especially as this construction accomplishes the wise end of preventing a multiplicity of suits, terminates litigation, and does no substantial injury to the debtor.

They are closely connected in subject matter and in the language employed, and it can hardly be doubted that whatever was meant by the words "goods or chattels" or "goods and chattels" in any one of these sections must have been intended of the same words in each of the other sections. These words do not apply to choses in action, but only to visible and tangible property. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, <cite class="va_code">99 Va. 495</cite>, 39 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 126</cite> (1901).

         - Where possession has not, at the time of a sale, remained five years with the borrower and those claiming under him, the purchaser can have no benefit from this section by reason of his own possession after the purchase. The circumstances that the possession by the borrower before the sale, and the possession by the purchaser after the sale, will together make five years cannot avail to give a title to the purchaser.

          But not by private demand, receipt and redelivery to borrower.
         </b>
         - A demand for chattels by the lender, who thereupon receives and immediately redelivers them to the borrower to be held on the same terms as before, the demand, receipt, and redelivery being in private, is not sufficient to bar the rights of creditors under this section.

          Or resumption of possession or recordation after five years.
         </b>
         - Five years peaceable and uninterrupted possession of chattels under a loan not evidenced by deed duly recorded, vests a title in the borrower which inures in favor of his creditors, and cannot be divested as to them by his returning the chattels to the lender after the five years have expired. Garth's Ex'rs v. Barksdale, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 101 (1816); Taylor v. Beale, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 93 (1847). See London v. Turner, 38 Va. (11 Leigh) 403 (1840).
        </p>
        <p>
         If a debtor remains in possession of chattels for five years, under a parol loan, they are liable to satisfy his creditors, though possession is resumed by the lender before executions are levied upon them. Garth's Ex'rs v. Barksdale, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 101 (1816); Taylor v. Beale, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 93 (1847); Beale v. Digges, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 582 (1850).

         Where, after a loan to a person with whom, or with those claiming under him, possession has remained five years, a deed is made and recorded by the lender, the deed cannot affect a creditor of the person in possession, and ought not to be received as evidence against such creditor.

          Until five years after such resumption of possession.
         </b>
         - Where possession has remained with the borrower, or with those claiming under him, for five years, and is then resumed by the lender, the possession must continue with the lender for the full period of five years from the time it was actually resumed before the title will be revested in the lender as against a creditor of the borrower. Pate v. Baker, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 80 (1837).

         <b>
     But only creditors existing when lender resumes possession are protected.
    </b>
    - If no writing declaring a loan is recorded, or no demand is made by the lender and pursued by course of law, for more than five years after possession is commenced, the loan is void as to the borrower's creditor, whose rights cannot be affected by lender's subsequent resumption of possession. But the creditors meant are those whose debts were contracted before the resumption of possession, or conveyance of the chattels, by the lender, they having given credit to loanee on the apparent ownership of the property.

     And recordation vacates loan as to debts subsequently contracted.

    - A deed recorded after possession has remained with a borrower more than five years vacates the loan, not as to debts contracted by the borrower before, but as to those contracted after, its recordation; and the onus is on the creditor to show that his debt was contracted before the deed was recorded, in order to render the property liable.

     Abandonment of recorded contract.
    </b>
    - Appellant sought to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment lien against land which had been conveyed to her father by one to whom it had been conveyed by the judgment debtor by a deed which was never recorded. Prior to the conveyance to the grantor of appellant's father, the judgment debtor and his wife had executed a title bond or contract of sale under which they were to convey the property to another party, which contract was duly recorded prior to the docketing of the judgment. Appellant contended that this title bond was in legal effect a deed, and, since it was recorded prior to the docketing of the judgment, that the judgment could never have been a lien against the land. The other party to the contract of sale joined with the judgment debtor in the conveyance to the grantor of appellant's father, in which conveyance it was stated that the contract of sale had been rescinded and that the other party to the contract joined in such deed as a release deed. It was held that any claim under the title bond or contract had been abandoned and such bond or contract was a nullity, and the land was subject to the judgment lien. Cox v. Williams, <cite class="va_code">183 Va. 152</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 312 (1944).

     United States is exempt from state registry laws.

    - The United States, as an incident of its sovereignty, has capacity to contract coextensive with the duties and powers of government, and this power carries with it complete exemption from all obligation to comply with state registry laws. It is not necessary for it to comply with the registry laws of the State in order to preserve a lien created by contract with it. The lien, without recordation, simply takes its place, and is superior to the claims of all other creditors who have no prior lien. United States v. Wm. R.

         </b>
         - Although this section applies only to those purchasers without notice, the statute nevertheless applies to lien creditors irrespective of actual notice. Because the contract of sale entered into upon the deed of trust sale in the instant case was not "duly admitted to record" at the time the finance company docketed its judgment, said contract was, pursuant to this section, void as against finance company.

    - By an indenture containing a demise of property for two years and one month, with the privilege to the lessee at his option of four successive renewals, each for a period of one year, the lessor has definitely parted with the control of his property for the full period to which the instrument related. Hence the paper constitutes a single contract giving the lessee a demise and four options, and it is not four several contracts of option. And a contract which provides an actual demise of real estate for two years and one month, and the means by which the lessee's enjoyment of the premises can be extended for four years more, is a contract for a term of more than five years in real estate and, as against a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, must be recorded.

    - In the instant case, a suit by a judgment creditor to subject the lands of his debtor to his judgments, complainant insisted that a marginal correction to a deed already recorded, made and signed by his debtor and acknowledged by him before the clerk and duly recorded before complainant's judgments were recovered, did not carry constructive notice to him of the facts contained in that memorandum, on the ground that there was no law for recording such memorandum. It was held that the clerk was authorized to record such marginal correction, and the recordation carried with it the desired information as fully as if it had been formally set out in the deed, and therefore there was no merit in complainant's contention.

        <p>
         <b>
     What constitutes constructive notice.
    </b>
    - It is well settled that what is sufficient to put a person of common prudence, ordinary diligence and business experience upon inquiry will charge him with the actual knowledge of the facts of which a diligent pursuit of that inquiry would have informed him. Fisher v. Borden, <cite class="va_code">111 Va. 535</cite>, 69 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 636</cite> (1910).
        </p>
        <p>
         Constructive notice imposes upon a purchaser such inquiry as is suggested by the facts which are known or disclosed in the transaction. But to affect a party with notice of the fact with which he is sought to be charged, whether he made inquiry or not, he must have had knowledge of facts and circumstances naturally calculated to excite suspicion in the mind of a person of ordinary care and prudence, and which would naturally prompt him to pause and inquire before consummating the transaction. Moreover, discovery of the fact should necessarily follow from the inquiry once embarked upon. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Cofer, <cite class="va_code">129 Va. 640</cite>, 106 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 695</cite> (1921).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Mere suspicion is not sufficient.
    </b>
    - Notice, to affect a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer, must be such as to affect his conscience. It may be either actual (direct and positive), or it may be circumstantial or presumptive. But it is not sufficient if it merely puts the party on inquiry. It must be clear and strong, and such as to fix upon him the imputation of bad faith. A mere suspicion of notice, even though it be a strong suspicion, is not sufficient. Hunton v. Wood, <cite class="va_code">101 Va. 54</cite>, 43 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 186</cite> (1903).

     Possession of land is no longer notice of title.
    </b>
    - The rights of a vendee of an interest in land of greater extent than a term of five years, under a verbal contract, who has paid the purchase price and is in possession, are inferior to those of a subsequent grantee of the land, who has no other evidence of the former's title than his possession. The object of the proviso annexed to the first sentence of this section was to abolish the common-law doctrine that the possession of real estate was notice of the right of the possessor.

        </p>
        <p>
         Under the common-law rule possession was sufficient to charge a purchaser with notice of an unrecorded deed. However, by statute enacted by the General Assembly of January 15, 1900, the common-law rule was abrogated by adding a proviso to the recording statute to the effect that mere possession shall not be notice to subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration.

However, it was never intended that where the purchaser had actual notice of the existence of a prior contract or conveyance, though unrecorded, he would be protected in his purchase of the land.

         - Corporation that declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy owned equitable title to real property that was owned by a Virginia partnership because the partners, who also owned the corporation, intended to transfer title to the corporation, the interest became part of the corporation's bankruptcy estate, pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S.

        <b>
         Deed need not be indexed to constitute notice.
        </b>
        - Bank's deed of trust put a mortgagor and all others on notice as to a lien because the deed of trust was properly recorded; the legal effect of the erroneous indexing by the clerk of court was of no consequence because
        §
        55-96 did not require indexing as part of recordation. Mega Int'l Commerce Bank v. MCAP Capital, L.L.C., 74 Va. Cir. 132, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 289 (Norfolk 2007).

        <b>
         Easement valid.
        </b>
        - Plea in bar was denied because a grantor's deed of an easement to the grantee for value after he transferred the servient parcel into a trust was a partial revocation of the transfer of the estate into the trust, making the easement valid and binding on successors in interest; the execution of the second easement satisfied the written notice requirement and revoked the interest in the property previously conveyed to the trust and the title, allowing the grantor to grant the second easement.

        <b>
         Failure to record easement.
        </b>
        - Electric cooperative was not bound by the language of an unrecorded express easement because the failure to record the express easement did not give notice, constructive or otherwise, of the express easement to someone purchasing that real estate.

         Contracts affecting title.
        </b>
        - In purchasers' quiet title action, assignees were ordered to cease any and all use of parking spaces that were appurtenant to a condominium unit because the purchasers possessed the exclusive right to use the spaces when they bought the unit at a foreclosure sale, and given that a trustee who had bought the unit had the superior claim to use of the parking spaces, when his deed of trust was foreclosed on, the assignees' rights to the parking spaces were likewise foreclosed on and extinguished; as of the date of foreclosure, the assignees were divested of their interest in the parking spaces, and the exclusive right to the use of the parking spaces was sold to the purchasers.

        <b>
         Recording did not protect easement from challenge.
        </b>
        - Easement was not protected from challenge by the statutory recording scheme because the conveyance of the parcel to a trust was valid, and since the grantee was not a bona fide purchaser, the recording of the second easement prior to the recording of the conveyance to the trust did not make a difference as to the grantee's status.

     Section protects purchaser paying only part of purchase price.
    </b>
    - Prior to
    
     §
    
    2472 of the Code of 1887, similar to this section, a subsequent purchaser under a contract not required to be recorded was not protected against a prior unrecorded conveyance unless he had paid the whole purchase price before he received notice of the unrecorded conveyance. Fulkerson v. Taylor, <cite class="va_code">102 Va. 314</cite>, 46 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1904). This was regarded as a hardship, and was corrected by the provisions of the section. But neither prior nor subsequent to the Code of 1887 did any such hardship exist as to the equitable owner of real estate. Both before and since the revision of 1887, it has been held that where the recording acts do not interfere, the judgment creditor can acquire no better right to the estate than the debtor himself has at the date of the recovery of the judgment. McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., <cite class="va_code">122 Va. 705</cite>, 96 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 453</cite> (1918).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     And it does not apply to judgment creditors.
    </b>
    - This section, which protects a subsequent purchaser under an unrecorded title to the extent of payments made when he receives notice of a prior unrecorded deed or writing and gives him a lien on the property purchased for so much of the purchase money as he had paid before notice, has no application to judgment creditors. Fulkerson v. Taylor, <cite class="va_code">102 Va. 314</cite>, 46 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1904); McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W.

     As "writing" refers only to contracts.
    </b>
    - The word "writing" in this section refers to contracts in writing by which a party acquires some interest in land, and not to judgments by which a party acquires a mere lien upon land. Fulkerson v. Taylor, <cite class="va_code">102 Va. 314</cite>, 46 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1904).

         - Even if it be assumed purchasers did not have actual or constructive notice of the lien, the lien of the deed of trust would only be void as to the purchasers, for so much of the purchase price as paid by them under the contract. Village Sav. Bank v. Willey, 65 Bankr. 832 (E.D. Va. 1986).

     Extent of lien of judgment against vendor where purchaser without perfect legal title.
    </b>
    - Where a valid contract for the sale of land has been entered into, and the recording acts do not interfere, a judgment against the vendor after the contract and before deed to the purchaser, and before the entire purchase money has been paid, is a lien on the land only to the extent of the purchase money then unpaid. McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., <cite class="va_code">122 Va. 705</cite>, 96 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 453</cite> (1918), overruling Fulkerson v. Taylor, <cite class="va_code">102 Va. 314</cite>, 46 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 309</cite> (1904), insofar as it declares that in order for a purchaser under a contract which is not required to be recorded, to be protected as to a subsequent judgment against his vendor, he must, before the date of such judgment, have become invested with a perfect equitable title by the payment of the whole of the purchase money.
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Lien properly granted.
    </b>
    - In an action against an alleged previous owner to remove a cloud on title to land where plaintiff, at the time of purchase, did not have actual or constructive notice of a prior tax suit and sale resulting in delivery of a deed of the property to defendant, and where plaintiff, as the purchaser at a judicial sale, was bound to look to the county land records and the papers in the suit for information as to the property sold, the title and the boundaries, but an examination at the time of the judicial sale of the sources would have disclosed only that the property was titled in the name of the person whose title the court was purporting to sell and that the taxes were delinquent for previous years, the trial court correctly granted the plaintiff a lien on defendant's property. Forrer v. Brown, <cite class="va_code">221 Va. 1098</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 483 (1981).

    - A purchaser of real estate has constructive notice of the recorded title papers of his vendor, and it is the duty of such purchaser to examine the proper records to ascertain whether his vendor, or those under whom he claims, have made any prior conveyances of said real estate, or whether the same is encumbered.

    - Circuit court properly ruled that an ex-wife's deed of trust had priority over a bank's deed of trust because, while the bank's deed of trust was recorded before the ex-wife's deed of trust, the after-acquired-title statute did not purport to affect the deeds of third parties or influence the relative priority of their interests, the bank's deed of trust was void against the ex-wife as a judgment lien creditor, and the bank's deed of trust was not properly recorded in the ex-wife's chain of title.

         - Under Virginia's stranger to title doctrine, which it retained from the common law, debtor wife, who did not have title in property prior to a conveyance of debtor husband's half interest to his daughter, did not become a grantor by virtue of the fact that the deed purported to reserve her a life estate. Applying the formula set forth in the Virginia statutes for valuing debtor husband's single life estate in the real property, the court determined that debtor husband was not insolvent or rendered insolvent by the conveyance and thus, the transfer was not avoidable as constructively fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Virginia law.

        Calculate the interest at eight percent upon the sum to the income of which, or upon the value of the property to the use of which, the joint life tenants are entitled. Multiply this interest by the present value of an annuity of $1, as shown in Column II of § 55.1-500, for the joint equal age of such joint life tenants. The joint equal age of such tenants shall be obtained as follows: Take the difference in age in years between such tenants and refer to the table in § 55.1-502 and add to the younger age the value opposite such difference, and the sum is the joint equal age; take this joint equal age and refer to the table in § 55.1-500 and find in Column II the value of an annuity of $1 a year payable for life during such joint equal age. The product of the interest and the value of an annuity for a given joint equal age is the gross value of the joint life estate of such person therein.

        Example: Doe, age 30, and Roe, age 40, are joint tenants for life in the whole of an estate worth $10,500: The difference in ages is 10 and, as shown by the table in § 55.1-502, the value opposite age difference 10 is seven. Seven added to 30, Doe's age, gives 37; as shown by the table in § 55.1-500, the value in Column II for an annuity of $1 for two joint lives at joint equal age 37 is $10.44 and no mills, and this, multiplied by $840 (the interest at eight percent on $10,000), gives $8,769.60 as the gross value of the joint life estate of such persons.

      <p>
       When more than two parties as joint tenants for life, or three or more parties as tenants in successive estates, are entitled to the annual interest on a sum of money, or are entitled to the use of any estate, or a part thereof, and are willing to accept a gross sum in lieu thereof, or the party liable for such interest, or affected by such claim, has the right to pay a gross sum in lieu thereof, or if the court in any legal proceeding orders a gross sum to be paid in lieu thereof, the sum shall be estimated according to the then value of an annuity of eight percent on the principal sum during the probable lives of such persons. Probable lives shall be computed from the Makehamized mortality table for total population in the United States, 1969-1971, published by the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce.

       Example: Three persons, age 30, 40, and 45, are joint tenants for life in the whole of an estate worth $10,500: the equivalent equal age, w, of these three persons is given by the following formula:
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       C
       30
       + C

       45
      </p>
      <p>

       w
       = _____________________________________________________
    = 258.711 where

       , and C
       <i>
        45
       </i>
       are found in column 6 of the above table.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       A linear interpolation between x = 40 and x = 41 in the above table would yield the value of x = 40.540, which would be the equivalent equal age of the persons involved.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, a linear interpolation between x = 40 and x = 41 would yield the value of A = 9.378 40.540:40.540:40.540.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       This figure multiplied by $840 (the interest at eight percent on $10,500) gives $7,877.52 as the gross value of the joint life estate of such persons therein.

        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       In any case in which, under the laws of the Commonwealth, a provision is made for commutation in money of a life estate when all the parties interested are under no disability, such provision shall also apply when any of the parties interested are under disability. Where any of the parties interested are under disability, the court may, upon application of the guardian, conservator, committee, or trustee, if any, and, if not, by a guardian ad litem appointed by the clerk or judge of said court, of any such person, on behalf of his ward, and upon hearing evidence satisfactory to such court or judge, enter an order authorizing such guardian, conservator, committee, trustee, or guardian ad litem to consent on behalf of such person under disability to such commutation. Such consent shall be as valid and effective as if the person on whose behalf it was given were sui juris and had given such consent. All judicial orders and decrees entered prior to July 1, 1960, authorizing any such commutation where persons under disability were interested, are hereby validated and confirmed, provided that nothing in this section shall be construed as intended to impair any vested right.

      <p>
       Whenever a party as tenant for life, or in any other manner, has a life interest in an estate that has been sold under an action for partition or has been reduced to money, stocks, bonds, or notes, susceptible of division and when the total cost of holding such money, stocks, bonds, or notes intact amounts to more than eight percent of the gross annual income, and when the party owning such life estate is willing to accept a lump sum in lieu of such annual income, upon the application of such person entitled to such annual income to any court of record having jurisdiction over the subject matter, the court may order that such party or parties having charge of such money, stocks, bonds, or notes shall pay to the party having the right to receive such annual income a lump sum in accordance with § 55.1-500. This section shall not affect any spendthrift trust.

         - Where an acknowledgment does not affirmatively show that it was taken by the clerk in his office, as required by this section, the presumption is that the officer did his duty and took it in his office. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 223 F. 743 (4th Cir. 1915), holding that testimony of the clerk that he sometimes took acknowledgments out of his office was inadmissible.

     Recordation in two or more places.

    - There is no rule of law, statutory or otherwise, which prevents the valid subsequent recordation in other counties or cities of a deed once recorded in a given county or city. The circumstances that the other county or city is subsequently formed out of a portion of the county in which the deed was first recorded, and that it is not necessary to record the deed a second time in such other county or city, are immaterial. The original deed may be recorded in any county or city wherein the property embraced in the deed or any part thereof is located, and it will give the constructive notice provided for by

         Signature of power of attorney for surviving spouse valid.
        </b>
        - Claim for an elective share signed and properly acknowledged by the attorney-in-fact for the surviving husband pursuant to a power of attorney was statutorily valid, although it was not signed by the husband himself, as it met the requirements for recordation of documents generally. Grubb v. Yacoub, 86 Va. Cir. 503, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 64 (Fairfax County July 3, 2013).

         Spouse's signature not required for elective share.

        - Plain statutory language for requirement of taking an elective share did not require that a surviving spouse sign the written claim for the elective share, as the statutory words "in person" modified only "before the court," and did not modify" by writing," which was construed according to regular requirements for admission of recorded documents.

        Obvious description errors in a recorded deed, deed of trust, or mortgage purporting to convey or transfer an interest in real property may be corrected by recording an affidavit in the land records of the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the property is located or where the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction was recorded. No correction of an obvious description error shall be inconsistent with the description of the property in any recorded subdivision plat.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1sIIc06a01s55.1-609ol1C">
        Prior to recording a corrective affidavit, the attorney seeking to record the affidavit shall deliver a copy of the affidavit to all parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, including the current owner of the property; to the attorney who prepared the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, if known and if possible; and to the title insurance company, if known, and give notice of the intent to record the affidavit and of each party's right to object to the affidavit. For an affidavit to correct an obvious description error in a deed as described in clause (a) of the definition of "obvious description error" in subsection A, notice and a copy of the affidavit shall also be provided to any owner of property adjoining a line to be corrected. The notice and a copy of the affidavit shall be delivered by personal service, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered by a commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, to the last known address of each party to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage to be corrected that (i) is contained in the land book maintained pursuant to § 58.1-3301 by the jurisdiction where the property is located and where the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction was recorded; (ii) is contained in the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction; (iii) has been provided to the attorney as a forwarding address; or (iv) has been established with reasonable certainty by other means, and to all other persons and entities to whom notice is required to be given. The notice and a copy of the affidavit shall be sent to the property address for the real property conveyed by the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction. If a locality is a party to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, the notice and a copy of the affidavit required by this subsection shall be sent to the county, city, or town attorney for the locality, if any, and if there is no such attorney, then to the chief executive for the locality. For the purposes of this section, the term "party" includes any locality that is a signatory. If the Commonwealth is a party to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, the notice and a copy of the affidavit required by this subsection shall be sent to the Attorney General and to the director, chief executive officer, or head of the state agency or chairman of the board of the state entity in possession or that had possession of the property.

A title insurance company, upon request, shall issue an endorsement to reflect the corrections made by the corrective affidavit and shall deliver a copy of the endorsement to all parties to the policy who can be found.

        The clerk shall record the corrective affidavit in the deed book and, notwithstanding their designation in the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction, index the affidavit in the names of the parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage as grantors and grantees as set forth in the affidavit. The costs associated with the recording of a corrective affidavit pursuant to this section shall be paid by the party that records the corrective affidavit. An affidavit recorded in compliance with this section shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in such affidavit.

         <b>
     The object of this section
    </b>
    is that the notary or other official taking the acknowledgment shall know and certify that the person whose name is signed to the instrument is the person who is acknowledging it. People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 916</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 823 (1965).

         <b>
     Taking acknowledgment is act judicial in character.
    </b>
    - The act of an officer in taking an acknowledgment of a deed is judicial in its character. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881); Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     But admitting a deed to record is a purely ministerial act.
    </b>
    To hold otherwise would not only be against the law, but would involve the absurdity of devolving upon the clerk the duty of assuming judicial functions in the performance of his ministerial duties. Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Which the clerk must perform.
    </b>
    - Where a deed is regular on its face, and the acknowledgment thereof has been taken and certified by a duly authorized officer, it is the duty of the clerk under this section to admit it to record when presented to him for that purpose. Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Admission to record is equivalent to actual recordation
    </b>
    for the purpose of notice. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Certificate is conclusive evidence of facts stated.
    </b>
    - In the absence of fraud, the certificate of the notary of the acknowledgment of a deed is conclusive evidence of all the facts stated therein and required by the statute. Burson v. Andes, <cite class="va_code">83 Va. 445</cite>, 8 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 249</cite> (1887).

        <p>
         <b>
     If it is reasonably certain that grantor made acknowledgment
    </b>
    of the instrument in question that is sufficient, because the object of the statute is that the notary shall know and certify that the person whose name is signed to the instrument is the person who is acknowledging it. Cumbee v. Myers, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 371</cite>, 350 S.E.2d 633 (1986).

     Acknowledgment implies the existence of two persons;
    </b>
    one who makes the acknowledgment, and another who receives and certifies it. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881); Leftwich v. City of Richmond, <cite class="va_code">100 Va. 164</cite>, 40 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 651</cite> (1902).

    of it before himself in his official character. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881).
        </p>
        <p>
         The clerk of a court cannot take his own acknowledgment of a deed executed by him so as to render it valid as against a subsequent purchaser for value from him, as a deed admitted to record. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881); Leftwich v. City of Richmond, <cite class="va_code">100 Va. 164</cite>, 40 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 651</cite> (1902).

        <p>
         <b>
     An acknowledgment of a writing cannot be taken by one who is interested
    </b>
    in it, as the act of the officer in taking the acknowledgment is judicial in character. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881); Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).

     Such as the grantee or beneficiary in a deed.
    </b>
    - The grantee or beneficiary in a deed cannot, as an officer, take the grantor's acknowledgment, and a deed so acknowledged and admitted to record cannot effect a notice under the registry laws. Davis v. Beazley, <cite class="va_code">75 Va. 491</cite> (1881); Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Or the trustee in a deed of trust.
    </b>
    - A trustee in a deed of trust, though interested only to the extent of his fees, is within the inhibition against taking an acknowledgment by one who is interested, as any interest whatever, no matter how slight or remote, will work a disqualification. Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).
    <br/>
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     But it may be presumed that trustee and notary are different persons.
    </b>
    - When trust deed describes trustee as "L. Triplett, Jr.," and the certificate begins "I, L. Triplett, Jr., a notary public," etc., but is signed "L. Triplett, N.P.," the inference is that the trustee and the notary are different persons; and the clerk is required to admit to record a deed so certified, but that will not preclude an enquiry into the validity of the certificate. Where there was gross laches and an appearance of acquiescence in adverse rights in addition to the facts stated above, the deed was held to have been sufficiently acknowledged. Corey v. Moore, <cite class="va_code">86 Va. 721</cite>, 11 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 114</cite> (1890).

    - Under a former statute, an acknowledgment taken by a deputy clerk of a deed to be recorded in the office of his principal was held valid. Town of Gate City v. Richmond, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 337</cite>, 33 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 615</cite> (1899). The deputy is now given express authority by this section and

         </b>
         - A deed was acknowledged before two aldermen of New York City, and on such acknowledgment was admitted to record in Virginia. The presumption is warranted that they are justices of the peace, when they undertake to act as such under authority of the statute, in the absence of proof to the contrary. The deed was properly admitted to record. Welles v. Cole, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 645 (1849).

        <p>
         <b>
     Section requires only substantial compliance.
    </b>
    - Substantial compliance with the forms of certificates of acknowledgment set out in this section was expressly authorized by the 1924 amendment which inserted the word "substantially" before "to the following effect," immediately preceding each form. People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 916</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 823 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         And even prior to the amendment it was held that only a substantial compliance with the material requirements of the statute was required, and that the use of words equivalent to those in the statute was sufficient. Hurst &amp; Co. v. Leckie, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 550</cite>, 34 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 464</cite> (1899). See Sullivan v. Gum, <cite class="va_code">106 Va. 245</cite>, 55 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 535</cite> (1906); Blair v. Rorer's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 1</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 767</cite>, cert. denied, 262 U.S. 734, 43 S. Ct. 704, 67 L. Ed. 1206 (1923); McCormack v. James, 36 F. 14 (W.D. Va. 1886).
        </p>
        <p>
         The acknowledgment of a deed, to entitle it to recordation, must be before the officers and according to the form prescribed by law; and the certificate thereof, in that form, or to that effect, must be written upon or annexed to the deed. The certificate must contain all the requisites of such form, and no omission can be supplied by parol evidence. But a substantial compliance is all that is necessary. Hurst &amp; Co. v. Leckie, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 550</cite>, 34 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 464</cite> (1899).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a power of attorney bore an acknowledgment on the same sheet wherein the notary stated that the grantor was personally known to her and had acknowledged the execution of the instrument, the acknowledgment substantially complied with this section, though neither the name of the grantor nor the date of the instrument was contained in it. People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 916</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 823 (1965).

     Certificate upheld if possible.
    </b>
    - The policy of the Commonwealth is to look with great leniency on certificates of acknowledgment, and to uphold them if possible. Cumbee v. Myers, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 371</cite>, 350 S.E.2d 633 (1986).

        </p>
        <p>
         The object of this section is met when it appears that the notary knows that the person making the acknowledgment is the person whose name is signed to the instrument. People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, <cite class="va_code">205 Va. 916</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 823 (1965).

         <b>
     In the effort to uphold an acknowledgment the instrument acknowledged may be looked to,
    </b>
    especially when referred to in the certificate. Thus, where a deed is referred to in a certificate of acknowledgment in such manner as to connect the former with the latter, or make it substantially a part thereof, and reading them together, there can be found a substantial compliance with the demands of the statute, the certificate should be sustained. Blair v. Rorer's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 1</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 767</cite>, cert. denied, 262 U.S. 734, 43 S. Ct. 704, 67 L. Ed. 1206 (1923).

There was an identity of names between the party signing and the party acknowledging. It was held that looking to the deed itself, the certificate of acknowledgment and the certificate of recordation, the certificate of acknowledgment was sufficient. Blair v. Rorer's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 1</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 767</cite>, cert. denied, 262 U.S. 734, 43 S. Ct. 704, 67 L. Ed. 1206 (1923).

    </b>
    - The certificate of acknowledgment to a deed did not contain the words "whose name is signed thereto," as required by this section, but there was an identity of names between the party signing and the party acknowledging. The lot conveyed was in a small town of about 400 inhabitants. It was hardly possible that the grantor was not known to the notary who took the acknowledgment, and there is therefore a presumption that the notary did his duty and took and certified the acknowledgment of the same person who had signed the deed. Otherwise it must be presumed that the notary was guilty of gross fraud. The acknowledgment was held sufficient. Blair v. Rorer's Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">135 Va. 1</cite>, 116 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 767</cite>, cert. denied, 262 U.S. 734, 43 S. Ct. 704, 67 L. Ed. 1206 (1923).

          Variance of dates.
         </b>
         - The fact that the date of the deed which is recorded is one day, and the certificate of acknowledgment describes the same as dated on a different day, does not invalidate the recordation, if the identity of the deed with that described in the certificate sufficiently appears from other parts of the certificate, and the annexation thereof to the deed.

          When acknowledgment made by executors.
         </b>
         - A certificate of the acknowledgment of a conveyance by executors, which did not state that they acknowledged the writing as executors but which conformed to the existing statute, was held sufficient, even though the acknowledgment was made prior to the enactment of
         §
         55-120. Virginia &amp; W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83 (W.D. Va. 1917), aff'd, 254 F. 379 (4th Cir. 1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 569, 40 S. Ct. 345, 64 L. Ed. 720 (1920).

    taking an acknowledgment was held sufficient when he was described in the certificate as a "commissioner in chancery for the city aforesaid." Hurst &amp; Co. v. Leckie, <cite class="va_code">97 Va. 550</cite>, 34 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 464</cite> (1899).

     The certificate need not state in express terms that the acknowledgment was taken before the officer in his city.

    It will be presumed that the acknowledgment was taken within the city, and that the officer did not do an illegal act by taking the acknowledgment out of his city. Sullivan v. Gum, <cite class="va_code">106 Va. 245</cite>, 55 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 535</cite> (1906).

     Acknowledgment and oath distinguished.
    </b>
    - An acknowledgment merely verifies that the person named executed the document in question. By swearing to a document, on the other hand, one vouches that the contents of the writing are true. A person who swears falsely may be guilty of a felony. Wisniewski v. Johnson, <cite class="va_code">223 Va. 141</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 223 (1982).

          Attorney acknowledgement.

         - Acknowledgment certificate indicated that only debtor and his wife acknowledged the deed of trust, which would require them to appear before the notary and state in her presence that the deed of trust was his or her act; they did not appear before the notary, and therefore could not have acknowledged the deed of trust in person. However,
         §
         47.1-15 provided that a signer must acknowledge the document in person, "unless otherwise authorized by law to do so",

          §

         47.1-15; therefore, the fact that attorney of debtor and his wife, rather than debtor and his wife, acknowledged the deed of trust did not make the acknowledgment invalid, as long as the attorney was authorized by law to do so.

          Meaning of "recovery."
         </b>
         - "Recovery," as a legal term, does not necessarily or usually mean the act by which the title or right of possession is acquired; but, on the contrary, its more common signification is the final adjudication that the title or right of possession was before acquired, and of right belongs, by virtue of the previous acquisition, to the party in whose favor the decree is made. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557 (4th Cir. 1913), rev'd on other grounds, 217 F. 875 (4th Cir. 1914).
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, it is apparent that the term used in the statute should be given the comprehensive meaning of the establishment by judgment of the right to land, and not the act of acquiring or regaining possession or acquiring title. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557 (4th Cir. 1913), rev'd on other grounds, 217 F. 875 (4th Cir. 1914).

         <b>
     What is suit for "recovery of land."
    </b>
    - A suit to subject land to the payment of a judgment is not a suit for the "recovery of land," and this section providing for the record of any recovery of land under judgment or decree has no application to the decree rendered therein. Steinman v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., <cite class="va_code">121 Va. 611</cite>, 93 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 684</cite> (1917). But see Clinchfield Coal Corp. v.

        The Real Estate Board shall make available on its website a flood risk information form. Such form shall be substantially as follows:
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Flood Risk Information Form
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this information form is to provide property owners and potential property owners with information regarding flood risk. This information form does not determine whether a property owner will be required to purchase a flood insurance policy. That determination is made by the lender providing a loan for the property at the lender's discretion.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage lenders are mandated under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 to require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who acquire loans from federally regulated, supervised, or insured financial institutions for the acquisition or improvement of land, facilities, or structures located within or to be located within a Special Flood Hazard Area. A Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) is a high-risk area defined as any land that would be inundated by a flood, also known as a base flood, having a one percent chance of occurring in a given year. The lender reviews the current National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps for the community in which the property is located to determine its location relative to the published SFHA and completes the Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (SFHDF), created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). If the lender determines that the structure is indeed located within a SFHA and the community is participating in the NFIP, the borrower is then notified that flood insurance will be required as a condition of receiving the loan. A similar review and notification are completed whenever a loan is sold on the secondary loan market or when the lender completes a routine review of its mortgage portfolio.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Properties that are not located in a SFHA can still flood. Flood damage is not generally covered by a standard home insurance policy. It is prudent to consider purchasing flood insurance even when flood insurance is not required by a lender. Properties not located in a SFHA may be eligible for a low-cost preferred risk flood insurance policy. Property owners and buyers are encouraged to consult with their insurance agent about flood insurance.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a flood? A flood is a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two or more properties, at least one of which is the policyholder's property, from (i) overflow of inland or tidal waters, (ii) unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source, (iii) mudflow, or (iv) collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood.
       <br/>

       FEMA is required to update Flood Maps every five years. Flood zones for this property may change due to periodic map updates. To determine what flood zone or zones a property is located in a buyer can visit the website for FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program or the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Flood Risk Information System website.

        - In a case in which the home buyers sued a real estate agent for fraud in the inducement because the results of the testing for radon gas in the basement had not been disclosed, the agent argued unsuccessfully that her compliance with
        §
        55-523 barred the buyers from asserting a viable fraud claim. The seller and the agent signed a radon acknowledgment form stating that they had no knowledge concerning the testing of the property for radon or the presence or absence of radon in the property; however, that was inconsistent with the disclosure statement in which the seller and the agent stated that the property had been tested for radon gas, and that failure to accurately inform the buyers prevented the agent from obtaining the protection of the statute.

          Relation to common law.
         </b>
         - Virginia Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act (CRESPA) contained no abrogation clause, and did not otherwise indicate any intent to preclude common-law claims. In the absence of such intent, the court could not impute a statutory abrogation of common-law rights; therefore, the court found that common-law claims against the bond could proceed. First Am.

          When settlement occurs.
         </b>
         - Seller's motion to dismiss an action for specific performance of a real estate sales contract was denied because paragraph 6 of the contract relied upon by seller in its motion to dismiss, applied by its plain terms only prior to closing and the sale had in effect closed, since seller had delivered the necessary deed and other closing documents to the escrow agent and purchaser had supplied the purchase money; a settlement occurs once the escrow agent has received the documents and funds necessary to carry out the terms of the sales contract and there has been compliance with the conditions of the contract.

       An exchange facilitator shall notify all existing exchange clients whose relinquished property is located in the Commonwealth, or whose replacement property held under a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement is located in the Commonwealth, of any change in control of the exchange facilitator.

Such notification shall set forth the name, address, and other contact information of the transferees. Notwithstanding the above, if the exchange facilitator is a publicly traded company and remains a publicly traded company after a change in control, the publicly traded company shall not be required to notify its existing clients of such change in control.

         Standing to pursue claim.

        - Demurrer filed by a settlement agent was overruled because a real estate agent's allegations of a violation of the Virginia Wet Settlement Act (WSA),
        §
        6.1-2.10 et seq. [now
        <span class="s1">

        55-525.1], based on the settlement agent's failure to escrow a disputed sum, under an instruction by the seller, pending a determination of the appropriate disbursement of the settlement proceeds survived the demurrer. The settlement agent's contention that only those to whom it owed a fiduciary duty had standing to make a claim under the WSA was without merit because the WSA displayed the Virginia General Assembly's intention that an instruction to violate the plain terms of an agreement by a person to whom a fiduciary duty was owed was not to be acted upon.

The memorandum of lien shall state the name of the claimant, the name of the owner of the commercial real estate, a description of the commercial real estate, the name and address of the person against whom the broker's claim for compensation is made, the name and address of the tenant paying the rent against which the lien is being claimed, the amount for which the lien is being claimed, and the real estate license number of the principal broker claiming the lien. The lien provided by this chapter and the right to rents secured by such lien shall be subordinate to all liens, deeds of trust, mortgages, or assignments of the leases, rents, or profits recorded prior to the time the memorandum of lien is recorded and shall not affect a purchaser for valuable consideration without constructive or actual notice of the recorded lien.

Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's noncompliance with the Act.

However, as provided in § 55.1-1208, the landlord shall not require a tenant to pay both a security deposit and the cost of damage insurance premiums if the total amount of any security deposit and damage insurance premiums exceeds the amount of two months' periodic rent. The landlord shall notify a tenant in writing that the tenant has the right to obtain a separate policy from the landlord's policy for damage insurance. If a tenant elects to obtain a separate policy, the tenant shall submit to the landlord written proof of such coverage and shall maintain such coverage at all times during the term of the rental agreement. Where a landlord obtains damage insurance coverage on behalf of a tenant, the insurance policy shall provide coverage for the tenant as an insured. The landlord shall recover from the tenant the actual costs of such insurance coverage and may recover administrative or other fees associated with administration of a damage insurance policy, including a tenant opting out of the insurance coverage provided by the landlord pursuant to this subsection. If a landlord obtains damage insurance for his tenants, the landlord shall provide to each tenant, prior to execution of the rental agreement, a summary of the insurance policy or certificate evidencing the coverage being provided and upon request of the tenant make available a copy of the insurance policy. For a tenant that opts out of the landlord's damage insurance program, the landlord shall allow such tenant to either provide their own damage insurance policy or pay the full security deposit.

The notice shall inform the tenant that any such renter's insurance obtained by the tenant does not cover flood damage and advise the tenant to contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or visit the websites for FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program or for the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Flood Risk Information System to obtain information regarding whether the property is located in a special flood hazard area. Any failure of the landlord to provide such notice shall not affect the validity of the rental agreement. If the tenant requests translation of the notice from the English language to another language, the landlord may assist the tenant in obtaining a translator or refer the tenant to an electronic translation service. In doing so, the landlord shall not be deemed to have breached any of his obligations under this chapter or otherwise become liable for any inaccuracies in the translation.

         Failure to comply with move-in inspection requirement.
        </b>
        - Although failing to comply with
        §
        55-248.11:1 requiring a move-in inspection may significantly limit the landlord's claim for damages, this restriction is not itself without limitation. Common sense dictates that the absence of a move-in inspection does not empower a tenant with an unfettered and unchecked ability to exert willful, and perhaps cataclysmic, damage on a residence during the duration of the tenancy. Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 312 (Clarke County June 29, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landlord's violation of the statutory requirement for a move-in inspection should act as a de facto presumption to bar a landlord's recovery where there is a dispute or conflict in the evidence of damages on which reasonable persons could differ because of the absence of the probative benchmark the move-in inspection would have established. Conversely, if there is no conflict, dispute or question that the tenant caused damage during the relevant period then a landlord's recovery for those damages should not be barred despite the landlord's failure to comply with
        §
        55-248.11:1. Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 312 (Clarke County June 29, 2018).

        - Failure of landlord to meet his statutory obligation under
        §
        55-248.11:1 for a move-in inspection did not automatically preclude any and all recovery by the landlord for damages during the tenancy. There was conflict and questions about whether the damage was due to issues that were the responsibility of the landlord or tenants. Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 312 (Clarke County June 29, 2018).

      <p>
       As part of the written report of the move-in inspection required by § 55.1-1214, the landlord shall disclose whether there is any visible evidence of mold in areas readily accessible within the interior of the dwelling unit. If the landlord's written disclosure states that there is no visible evidence of mold in the dwelling unit, this written statement shall be deemed correct unless the tenant objects to it in writing within five days after receiving the report. If the landlord's written disclosure states that there is visible evidence of mold in the dwelling unit, the tenant shall have the option to terminate the tenancy and not take possession or remain in possession of the dwelling unit. If the tenant requests to take possession, or remain in possession, of the dwelling unit, notwithstanding the presence of visible evidence of mold, the landlord shall promptly remediate the mold condition but in no event later than five business days after the tenant's request to take possession or decision to remain in possession, reinspect the dwelling unit to confirm that there is no visible evidence of mold in the dwelling unit, and prepare a new report stating that there is no visible evidence of mold in the dwelling unit upon reinspection.

     Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's violation.

    - In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by
    
     §
    
    55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, because the Act does not, either through the express language of
    <span class="s1">
     §§
    </span>
    55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the common-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenant's personal injuries caused by the landlord's failure to repair premises under the tenant's control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's noncompliance with the Act.

       <p>
        Common law rule regarding a landlord's duty is the law of Virginia: absent concealment or fraud by the landlord as to some defect in the premises, known to him and unknown to the tenant, the tenant takes the premises in whatever condition they may be in, thus assuming all risk of personal injury from defect therein; since the statutory provision does not seem to plainly manifest an intent to change the common law, the statute does not create a new statutory duty.

       <p>
        Landlord's demurrer was granted because a tenant did not state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted on his claim that a landlord violated a new statutory duty created by the General Assembly; the statute establishes the standard of care, not a statutory duty.

        No landlord may demand or receive a security deposit, however denominated, in an amount or value in excess of two months' periodic rent. Upon termination of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs last, such security deposit, whether it is property or money held by the landlord as security as provided in this section, may be applied by the landlord solely to (i) the payment of accrued rent, including the reasonable charges for late payment of rent specified in the rental agreement; (ii) the payment of the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenant's noncompliance with § 55.1-1227, less reasonable wear and tear; (iii) other damages or charges as provided in the rental agreement; or (iv) actual damages for breach of the rental agreement pursuant to § 55.1-1251. The security deposit and any deductions, damages, and charges shall be itemized by the landlord in a written notice given to the tenant, together with any amount due to the tenant, within 45 days after the termination date of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs last. As of the date of the termination of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs last, the tenant shall be required to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to the landlord. If the termination date is prior to the expiration of the rental agreement or any renewal thereof, or the tenant has not given proper notice of termination of the rental agreement, the tenant shall be liable for actual damages pursuant to § 55.1-1251, in which case, the landlord shall give written notice of security deposit disposition within the 45-day period but may retain any security balance to apply against any financial obligations of the tenant to the landlord pursuant to this chapter or the rental agreement. If the tenant fails to vacate the dwelling unit as of the termination of the tenancy, the landlord may file an unlawful detainer action pursuant to § 8.01-126.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1sIIIc12a02s55.1-1226ol1B">
        Where there is more than one tenant subject to a rental agreement, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by each of the tenants, disposition of the security deposit shall be made with one check being payable to all such tenants and sent to a forwarding address provided by one of the tenants. The landlord shall make the security deposit disposition within the 45-day time period required by subsection A, but if no forwarding address is provided to the landlord, the landlord may continue to hold such security deposit in escrow. If a tenant fails to provide a forwarding address to the landlord to enable the landlord to make a refund of the security deposit, upon the expiration of one year from the date of the end of the 45-day time period, the landlord may remit such sum to the State Treasurer as unclaimed property on a form prescribed by the administrator that includes the name; social security number, if known; and last known address of each tenant on the rental agreement. If the landlord or managing agent is a real estate licensee, compliance with this subsection shall be deemed compliance with § 54.1-2108 and corresponding regulations of the Real Estate Board.

        Nothing in this section shall be construed by a court of law or otherwise as entitling the tenant, upon the termination of the tenancy, to an immediate credit against the tenant's delinquent rent account in the amount of the security deposit. The landlord shall apply the security deposit in accordance with this section within the 45-day time period required by subsection A. However, provided that the landlord has given prior written notice in accordance with this section, the landlord may withhold a reasonable portion of the security deposit to cover an amount of the balance due on the water, sewer, or other utility account that is an obligation of the tenant to a third-party provider under the rental agreement for the dwelling unit, and upon payment of such obligations the landlord shall provide written confirmation to the tenant within 10 days, along with payment to the tenant of any balance otherwise due to the tenant. In order to withhold such funds as part of the disposition of the security deposit, the landlord shall have so advised the tenant of his rights and obligations under this section in (i) a termination notice to the tenant in accordance with this chapter, (ii) a written notice to the tenant confirming the vacating date in accordance with this section, or (iii) a separate written notice to the tenant at least 15 days prior to the disposition of the security deposit.

        The landlord shall notify the tenant in writing of any deductions provided by this section to be made from the tenant's security deposit during the course of the tenancy. Such notification shall be made within 30 days of the date of the determination of the deduction and shall itemize the reasons in the same manner as provided in subsection F. No such notification shall be required for deductions made less than 30 days prior to the termination of the rental agreement. If the landlord willfully fails to comply with this section, the court shall order the return of the security deposit to the tenant, together with actual damages and reasonable attorney fees, unless the tenant owes rent to the landlord, in which case the court shall order an amount equal to the security deposit credited against the rent due to the landlord. In the event that damages to the premises exceed the amount of the security deposit and require the services of a third-party contractor, the landlord shall give written notice to the tenant advising him of that fact within the 45-day period required by subsection A. If notice is given as prescribed in this subsection, the landlord shall have an additional 15-day period to provide an itemization of the damages and the cost of repair. This section shall not preclude the landlord or tenant from recovering other damages to which he may be entitled under this chapter. The holder of the landlord's interest in the premises at the time of the termination of the tenancy, regardless of how the interest is acquired or transferred, is bound by this section and shall be required to return any security deposit received by the original landlord that is duly owed to the tenant, whether or not such security deposit is transferred with the landlord's interest by law or equity, regardless of any contractual agreements between the original landlord and his successors in interest.

If the tenant desires to be present when the landlord makes the inspection, he shall, in writing, so advise the landlord, who in turn shall notify the tenant of the date and time of the inspection, which must be made within 72 hours of delivery of possession. Following the move-out inspection, the landlord shall provide the tenant with a written security deposit disposition statement, including an itemized list of damages. If additional damages are discovered by the landlord after the security deposit disposition has been made, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the landlord from recovery of such damages against the tenant, provided, however, that the tenant may present into evidence a copy of the move-out report to support the tenant's position that such additional damages did not exist at the time of the move-out inspection.

         Landlord's insurer had right to proceed against tenants who started a fire.

        - Landlord waived any rights it had under the lease against its tenants for starting a fire in the leased apartment by returning the tenants' security deposit. However, the landlord did not waive its negligence claim against the tenants, which arose independently of the lease, and therefore the landlord's insurer could proceed in subrogation against the tenants on the negligence claim.

        §
        55-248.15:1, because the tenant stated a claim for return of the security deposit; the tenant alleged that she and her co-tenant paid the rent due under the lease in full, a final inspection of the property was conducted, no itemized statement of damages was provided, and the landlord's failure to comply with the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act was willful.

          A. 1.
    The tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises; make necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements; supply necessary or agreed-upon services; or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen, or contractors.

          The landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant in case of emergency. The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except in case of emergency or if it is impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant notice of his intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Unless impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 72 hours' notice of routine maintenance to be performed that has not been requested by the tenant. If the tenant makes a request for maintenance, the landlord is not required to provide notice to the tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to § 44-146.17 in response to a communicable disease of public health threat as defined in § 44-146.16, the tenant may provide written notice to the landlord requesting that one or more nonemergency property conditions in the dwelling unit not be addressed in the normal course of business of the landlord due to such communicable disease of public health threat. In such case, the tenant shall be deemed to have waived any and all claims and rights under this chapter against the landlord for failure to address such nonemergency property conditions. At any time thereafter, the tenant may consent in writing to the landlord addressing such nonemergency property conditions in the normal course of business of the landlord. In the case of a tenant who has provided notice that he does not want nonemergency repairs made during the state of emergency due to a communicable disease of public health threat, the landlord may nonetheless enter the dwelling unit to do nonemergency repairs and maintenance with at least seven days' written notice to the tenant and at a time consented to by the tenant, no more than once every six months, provided that the employees and agents sent by the landlord are wearing all appropriate and reasonable personal protective equipment as required by state law. Furthermore, if the landlord is required to conduct maintenance or an inspection pursuant to the agreement for the loan or insurance policy that covers the dwelling unit, the tenant shall allow such maintenance or inspection, provided that the employees and agents sent by the landlord are wearing all appropriate personal protective equipment as required by state law.

        Upon the sole determination by the landlord of the existence of a nonemergency property condition in the dwelling unit that requires the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit in order for the landlord to properly remedy such property condition, the landlord may, upon at least 30 days' written notice to the tenant, require the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit for a period not to exceed 30 days to a comparable dwelling unit, or hotel, as selected by the landlord and at no expense or cost to the tenant. The landlord shall not be required to pay for any other expenses of the tenant that arise after the temporary relocation period. The landlord and tenant may agree for the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit in less than 30 days. For purposes of this subsection, "nonemergency property condition" means (i) a condition in the dwelling unit that, in the determination of the landlord, is necessary for the landlord to remedy in order for the landlord to be in compliance with § 55.1-1220; (ii) the condition does not need to be remedied within a 24-hour period, with any condition that needs to be remedied within 24 hours being defined as an "emergency condition"; and (iii) the condition can only be effectively remedied by the temporary relocation of the tenant pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

        Upon written request of a tenant in a dwelling unit, the landlord shall install a carbon monoxide alarm in the tenant's dwelling unit within 90 days. The landlord may charge the tenant a reasonable fee to recover the costs of the equipment and labor for such installation. The landlord's installation of a carbon monoxide alarm shall be in compliance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.).

       As used in this subdivision, "reasonable justification" includes the tenant's reasonable concern for his own health, or the health of any authorized occupant, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to § 44-146.17 in response to a communicable disease of public health threat as defined in § 44-146.16, provided that the tenant has provided written notice to the landlord informing the landlord of such concern. In such circumstances, the tenant shall provide to the landlord or managing agent a video tour of the dwelling unit or other acceptable substitute for exhibiting the dwelling unit for sale or lease.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tenant shall continue to be responsible for payment of rent under the rental agreement during the period of any temporary relocation. The landlord shall pay all costs of repairs or remediation required to address the nonemergency property condition. Refusal of the tenant to cooperate with a temporary relocation pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed a breach of the rental agreement, unless the tenant agrees to vacate the unit and terminate the rental agreement within the 30-day notice period. If the landlord properly remedies the nonemergency property condition within the 30-day period, nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle the tenant to terminate the rental agreement. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the landlord from taking legal action against the tenant for any noncompliance that occurs during the period of any temporary relocation pursuant to this subsection. During the pendency of an unlawful detainer filed by the landlord against the tenant, the landlord may request the court to enter an order requiring the tenant to provide the landlord with access to such dwelling unit.

The landlord shall provide the tenant with either (i) a comparable dwelling unit, as selected by the landlord, at no expense or cost to the tenant or (ii) a hotel room, as selected by the landlord, at no expense or cost to the tenant. The landlord shall not be required to pay for any other expenses of the tenant that arise after the relocation period. The tenant shall continue to be responsible for payment of rent under the rental agreement during the period of any temporary relocation and for the remainder of the term of the rental agreement following the remediation.

       Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or a noncompliance with any provision of this chapter, materially affecting health and safety, the tenant may serve a written notice on the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice if such breach is not remedied in 21 days.

      <p>
       If the landlord has been served with a prior written notice that required the landlord to remedy a breach, and the landlord remedied such breach, where the landlord intentionally commits a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, the tenant may serve a written notice on the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the subsequent breach, make reference to the prior breach of a like nature, and state that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice.

       If the breach is remediable by repairs and the landlord adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not terminate. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant. In addition, the tenant may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for noncompliance by the landlord with the provisions of the rental agreement or of this chapter. The tenant shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees unless the landlord proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the landlord's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. If the rental agreement is terminated due to the landlord's noncompliance, the landlord shall return the security deposit in accordance with § 55.1-1226.

     Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's violation.

    - In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by

    55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act,

    55-248.2 through 55-248.40, because the Act does not, either through the express language of
    <span class="s1">
     §§
    </span>
    55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the common-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenant's personal injuries caused by the landlord's failure to repair premises under the tenant's control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's noncompliance with the Act.

         - In an action for damages by tenants against landlords, the trial court erred by not awarding attorney's fees under

         55-248.2 et seq., because the evidence was undisputed that the landlords' managing agent's actions in improperly storing the personal property and ultimately destroying it without giving the required notice were willful violations of the Act, thus requiring an award of attorney's fees for prevailing on that claim.

      <p>
       If the landlord willfully fails to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to the tenant, then rent abates until possession is delivered, and the tenant may (i) terminate the rental agreement upon at least five days' written notice to the landlord, upon which termination the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security deposits, or (ii) demand performance of the rental agreement by the landlord. If the tenant elects, he may file an action for possession of the dwelling unit against the landlord or any person wrongfully in possession and recover the damages sustained by him. If a person's failure to deliver possession is willful and not in good faith, an aggrieved person may recover from that person the actual damages sustained by him and reasonable attorney fees.

      <p>
       If the dwelling unit or premises is damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty to an extent that the tenant's enjoyment of the dwelling unit is substantially impaired or required repairs can only be accomplished if the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, either the tenant or the landlord may terminate the rental agreement. The tenant may terminate the rental agreement by vacating the premises and within 14 days thereafter, serving on the landlord a written notice of his intention to terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the date of vacating. If continued occupancy is lawful, § 55.1-1411 shall apply.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The landlord may terminate the rental agreement by giving the tenant 14 days' notice of his intention to terminate the rental agreement on the basis of the landlord's determination that such damage requires the removal of the tenant and that the use of the premises is substantially impaired, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the expiration of the notice period.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all security deposits in accordance with § 55.1-1226 and prepaid rent, plus accrued interest, recoverable by law unless the landlord reasonably believes that the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant was the cause of the damage or casualty, in which case the landlord shall provide a written statement to the tenant for the security and prepaid rent, plus accrued interest based upon the damage or casualty, and may recover actual damages sustained pursuant to § 55.1-1251. Proration for rent in the event of termination or apportionment shall be made as of the date of the casualty.

         Landlord's insurer had right to proceed against tenants who started a fire.

        - Landlord waived any rights it had under the lease against its tenants for starting a fire in the leased apartment by returning the tenants' security deposit. However, the landlord did not waive its negligence claim against the tenants, which arose independently of the lease, and therefore the landlord's insurer could proceed in subrogation against the tenants on the negligence claim.

        In an action for possession based upon nonpayment of rent or in an action for rent by a landlord when the tenant is in possession, the tenant may assert as a defense that there exists upon the leased premises a condition that constitutes, or will constitute, a fire hazard or a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of the occupants of the dwelling unit, including (i) a lack of heat, running water, light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities; (ii) an infestation of rodents; or (iii) a condition that constitutes material noncompliance on the part of the landlord with the rental agreement or provisions of law. The assertion of any defense provided for in this section shall be conditioned upon the following:

For the purposes of this subsection, what period of time shall be deemed to be unreasonable delay is left to the discretion of the court, except that there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a period in excess of 30 days from receipt of the notification by the landlord is unreasonable; and

        The tenant may assert that there exists upon the leased premises a condition that constitutes a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with provisions of law or that, if not promptly corrected, will constitute a fire hazard or serious threat to the life, health, or safety of occupants of the premises, including (i) a lack of heat or hot or cold running water, except where the tenant is responsible for payment of the utility charge and where the lack of such heat or hot or cold running water is the direct result of the tenant's failure to pay the utility charge; (ii) a lack of light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities; (iii) an infestation of rodents; or (iv) the existence of paint containing lead pigment on surfaces within the dwelling, provided that the landlord has notice of such paint. The tenant may file such an assertion in a general district court in which the premises is located by a declaration setting forth such assertion and asking for one or more forms of relief as provided for in subsection D.

For the purposes of this subsection, what period of time shall be deemed to be unreasonable delay is left to the discretion of the court, except that there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a period in excess of 30 days from receipt of the notification by the landlord is unreasonable; and

The court, on motion of either party or on its own motion, may hold hearings subsequent to the initial proceeding in order to further determine the rights and obligations of the parties. Distribution of escrow moneys may only occur by order of the court after a hearing of which both parties are given notice as required by law or upon motion of both the landlord and tenant or upon certification by the appropriate inspector that the work required by the court to be done has been satisfactorily completed.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, when a breach of the tenant's obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act that is not remediable and that poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, by the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety is engaged in by an authorized occupant or a guest or invitee of the tenant, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such activities unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord's action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises that constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court's docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out in this section shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.

However, these provisions shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenant's status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offense or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails to promptly notify the landlord within 24 hours that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event later than seven days. If the provisions of this subsection are not applicable, the tenant shall remain responsible for the acts of the other co-tenants, authorized occupants, or guests or invitees pursuant to § 55.1-1227 and is subject to termination of the tenancy pursuant to the lease and this chapter.

       For a landlord who owns more than four rental dwelling units or more than a 10 percent interest in more than four rental dwelling units, whether individually or through a business entity, in the Commonwealth, if rent is unpaid when due, the landlord shall serve upon the tenant a written notice informing the tenant of the total amount due and owed. The written notice shall also offer the tenant a payment plan under which the tenant shall be required to pay the total amount due and owed in equal monthly installments over a period of the lesser of six months or the time remaining under the rental agreement. The total amount due and owed under a payment plan shall not include any late fees, and no late fees shall be assessed during any time period in which a tenant is making timely payments under a payment plan. This notice shall also inform the tenant that if the tenant fails to either pay the total amount due and owed or enter into the payment plan offered, or an alternative payment arrangement acceptable to the landlord, within 14 days of receiving the written notice from the landlord, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55.1-1251. If the tenant fails to pay in full or enter into a payment plan with the landlord within 14 days of when the notice is served on him, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55.1-1251. If the tenant enters into a payment plan and after the plan becomes effective, fails to pay any installment required by the plan within 14 days of its due date, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55.1-1251, provided that he has sent the tenant a new notice advising the tenant that the rental agreement will terminate unless the tenant pays the total amount due and owed as stated on the notice within 14 days of receipt. The option of entering into a payment plan or alternative payment arrangement pursuant to this subsection may only be utilized once during the time period of the rental agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a tenant from availing himself of any other rights or remedies available to him under the law, nor shall the tenant's eligibility to participate or participation in any rent relief program offered by a nonprofit organization or under the provisions of any federal, state, or local law, regulation, or action prohibit the tenant from taking advantage of the provisions of this subsection.

        If the tenant commits a breach that is not remediable, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, when a breach of the tenant's obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act that is not remediable and that poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, by the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety is engaged in by an authorized occupant or a guest or invitee of the tenant, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such activities unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord's action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises that constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court's docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out in this section shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.

However, these provisions shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenant's status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offense or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails to promptly notify the landlord within 24 hours that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event later than seven days.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, when a breach of the tenant's obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act that is not remediable and that poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, by the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety is engaged in by an authorized occupant or a guest or invitee of the tenant, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such activities unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord's action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises that constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court's docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out in this section shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.

       If the rental agreement requires the tenant to give notice to the landlord of an anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days and the tenant fails to do so, the landlord may recover actual damages from the tenant. During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary to protect his possessions and property. The rental agreement is deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date of abandonment by the tenant. If the landlord cannot determine whether the premises has been abandoned by the tenant, the landlord shall serve written notice on the tenant in accordance with § 55.1-1202 requiring the tenant to give written notice to the landlord within seven days that the tenant intends to remain in occupancy of the premises. If the tenant gives such written notice to the landlord, or if the landlord otherwise determines that the tenant remains in occupancy of the premises, the landlord shall not treat the premises as having been abandoned. Unless the landlord receives written notice from the tenant or otherwise determines that the tenant remains in occupancy of the premises, upon the expiration of seven days from the date of the landlord's notice to the tenant, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the premises has been abandoned by the tenant, and the rental agreement shall be deemed to terminate on that date.

        No landlord may accept full payment of rent, as well as any damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs, and receive an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to an unlawful detainer action filed under Article 13 (§ 8.01-124 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 and proceed with eviction under § 55.1-1245, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the landlord. However, a landlord may accept partial payment of rent and other amounts owed by the tenant to the landlord and receive an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to an unlawful detainer action filed under Article 13 (§ 8.01-124 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 and proceed with eviction for nonpayment of rent under § 55.1-1245, provided that the landlord has stated in a written notice to the tenant that any and all amounts owed to the landlord by the tenant, including payment of any rent, damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs, would be accepted with reservation and would not constitute a waiver of the landlord's right to evict the tenant from the dwelling unit. Such notice may be included in a written termination notice given by the landlord to the tenant in accordance with § 55.1-1245, and if so included, nothing herein shall be construed by a court of law or otherwise as requiring such landlord to give the tenant subsequent written notice. Such notice shall include the following language: "Any partial payment of rent made before or after a judgment of possession is ordered will not prevent your landlord from taking action to evict you. However, full payment of all amounts you owe the landlord, including all rent as contracted for in the rental agreement that is owed to the landlord as of the date payment is made, as well as any damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs made at least 48 hours before the scheduled eviction will cause the eviction to be canceled, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the landlord." If the landlord elects to seek possession of the dwelling unit pursuant to § 8.01-126, the landlord shall provide a copy of this notice to the court for service to the tenant, along with the summons for unlawful detainer. If the dwelling unit is a public housing unit or other housing unit subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, nothing in this section shall be construed to require that written notice be given to any public agency paying a portion of the rent under the rental agreement. If a landlord enters into a new written rental agreement with the tenant prior to eviction, an order of possession obtained prior to the entry of such new rental agreement is not enforceable. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a landlord with four or fewer rental dwelling units, or up to a 10 percent interest in four or fewer rental dwelling units, may limit a tenant's use of the right of redemption to once per lease period, provided that the landlord provides written notice of such limitation to the tenant.

Upon receipt of such payment, the landlord, or the landlord's attorney or managing agent, shall promptly notify the officer to whom the writ of eviction has been delivered to be executed that the execution of the writ of eviction shall be canceled. If the landlord has actual knowledge that the tenant has made such payment and willfully fails to provide such notification, such act may be deemed to be a violation of § 55.1-1243.1. In addition, the landlord shall transmit to the court a notice of satisfaction of any money judgment in accordance with § 8.01-454.

Any payments made by the tenant shall be by cashier's check, certified check, or money order. A court shall not issue a writ of eviction on any judgment for possession that has expired or has been marked as satisfied.

       If the tenant presents a redemption tender to the court at the return date, the court shall continue the action for unlawful detainer for 10 days following the return date for payment to the landlord of all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, and dismiss the action upon such payment. Should the landlord not receive full payment of all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, within 10 days of the return date, the court shall, without further evidence, grant to the landlord judgment for all amounts due and immediate possession of the premises. For purposes of this section, "redemption tender" means a written commitment to pay all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, by a local government or nonprofit entity within 10 days of such return date.

Actual damages for breach of the rental agreement may include a claim for rent that would have accrued until the expiration of the term of the rental agreement or until a tenancy pursuant to a new rental agreement commences, whichever occurs first, provided that nothing contained in this section shall diminish the duty of the landlord to mitigate actual damages for breach of the rental agreement.

The landlord may include in the rental agreement a reasonable liquidated damage penalty, not to exceed an amount equal to 150 percent of the per diem of the monthly rent, for each day the tenant remains in the dwelling unit after the termination date specified in the landlord's notice.

      </h3>
      <p>
       If any items of personal property are left in the dwelling unit, the premises, or any storage area provided by the landlord after the rental agreement has terminated and delivery of possession has occurred, the landlord may consider such property to be abandoned. The landlord may dispose of the property so abandoned as the landlord sees fit or appropriate, provided that he has given (i) a termination notice to the tenant in accordance with this chapter, including a statement that any items of personal property left in the dwelling unit or the premises would be disposed of within the 24-hour period after termination; (ii) written notice to the tenant in accordance with § 55.1-1249, including a statement that any items of personal property left in the dwelling unit, the premises, or the storage area would be disposed of within the 24-hour period after expiration of the seven-day notice period; or (iii) a separate written notice to the tenant, including a statement that any items of personal property left in the dwelling unit, the premises, or the storage area would be disposed of within 24 hours after expiration of a 10-day period from the date such notice was given to the tenant. Any written notice to the tenant shall be given in accordance with § 55.1-1202. The tenant shall have the right to remove his personal property from the dwelling unit, the premises, or the storage area at reasonable times during the 24-hour period after termination or at such other reasonable times until the landlord has disposed of the remaining personal property of the tenant.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       During the 24-hour period and until the landlord disposes of the remaining personal property of the tenant, the landlord shall not have any liability for the risk of loss for such personal property. If the landlord fails to allow reasonable access to the tenant to remove his personal property as provided in this section, the tenant shall have a right to injunctive or other relief as provided by law. If the landlord received any funds from any sale of abandoned property as provided in this section, the landlord shall pay such funds to the account of the tenant and apply the funds to any amounts due the landlord by the tenant, including the reasonable costs incurred by the landlord in selling, storing, or safekeeping such property. If any such funds are remaining after application, the remaining funds shall be treated as a security deposit under the provisions of § 55.1-1226. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable if the landlord has been granted an order of possession for the premises in accordance with Title 8.01 and execution of a writ of eviction has been completed pursuant to <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-470" target="_blank">§ 8.01-470</a></cite>.

       Nothing in this section shall affect the right of a landlord to enforce an inchoate or perfected lien of the landlord on the personal property of a tenant in a dwelling unit or on the premises leased to such tenant and the right of a landlord to distress, levy, and seize such personal property as otherwise provided by law.

     Available remedies.
    </b>
    - This section discloses a legislative intent to provide contract remedies, not a recovery in tort, because: (1) the assignment to the court of the factual determination of whether a landlord is responsible for an act or omission prohibited by the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act,
    
     §§
    
    55-248.2 through 55-248.40, is entirely appropriate in an equitable claim, but at odds with the role of the court vis-a-vis the jury in an action at law for damages, such as an action for personal injury; (2) to allow the question of whether a tenant may recover damages for personal injuries to turn on the court's discretion would be inconsistent with the recognized principle of tort law that a plaintiff is entitled to compensation sufficient to make him whole; and (3) the provision allowing a court to enjoin a landlord from continuing an act or omission prohibited by the Act and to award damages in its discretion conforms to the longstanding authority of chancery courts to award damages incident to an award of equitable relief.

     Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's violation.

    - In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by
    
     §
    
    55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act,
    <span class="s1">
     §§
    </span>
    55-248.2 through 55-248.40, because the Act does not, either through the express language of
    <span class="s1">
     §§
    </span>
    55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the common-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenant's personal injuries caused by the landlord's failure to repair premises under the tenant's control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlord's noncompliance with the Act.

    - This section addresses the necessity and type of notice required to terminate various kinds of tenancies and provides, in part, that notice is not necessary from or to a tenant whose term is to end at a certain time; a one-year, fixed term lease ends at "a certain time" within the meaning of this section and a tenant may not, therefore, be subject to liability for failing to comply with a lease provision requiring notice of his intent to vacate the premises at the end of the fixed term.

It was held that this did not create a tenancy from year to year so as to entitle the tenant to the legal notice to quit. Crawford v. Morris, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 90 (1848).

         Landlord's termination of lease that allowed tenant perpetual renewals.
        </b>
        - Court (1) decided that landlord's nine-month termination notice to tenant was reasonable notice since there was no lease provision that governed the landlord's giving of a notice to terminate, and (2) allowed the landlord to terminate the lease, which provided for automatic 12-month extensions unless the tenant gave 12-month advance notice to terminate. Because the lease did not clearly state that the tenant could renew it in perpetuity, using words of perpetuity, such as "forever," "for all time," and "in perpetuity" and law did not favor perpetual leases, the landlord could terminate the lease upon giving of reasonable notice.

      <p>
       No covenant or promise by a lessee of nonresidential property to pay the rent, or that he will keep or leave the premises in good repair, shall have the effect, if the buildings on the premises are destroyed by fire or otherwise, in whole or in part, without fault or negligence on his part, or if he is deprived of the possession of the premises by the public enemy, of binding him to make such payment or repair or erect such buildings again, unless there are other words showing it to be the intent of the parties that he should be so bound. But in case of such destruction there shall be a reasonable reduction of the rent for such time as may elapse until there are again upon the premises buildings of as much value to the tenant for his purposes as what may have been so destroyed, and, in case of such deprivation of possession, a like reduction until possession of the premises is restored to him.

         It is not sufficient, to entitle the tenant to a reduction in the rent, that the buildings on the leased premises have been destroyed, but it is made a condition to that right that they were destroyed without fault or negligence on his part.

         This section has been construed to mean that unless there be "other words showing it to be the intent of the parties that he should be so bound," negligence must be present on the part of the lessee before any recovery can be had against him for damage to the leased premises at the termination of the lease.

    - This section expressly excepts a case where there are other words in the lease which set out the condition governing the payment or abatement of rent.

     A covenant to leave in good repair is not a covenant to rebuild,

        <p>
         A tenant who contracted to repair is not bound to rebuild a parapet, which was not necessary to the preservation or protection of the property, where it fell because of hidden structural defects unknown to the tenant. In order to bind the tenant to reconstruct it, his covenant ought to be special and expressed, and so clear as to leave no doubt. Willis v. Wrenn's Ex'x, <cite class="va_code">141 Va. 385</cite>, 127 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 312</cite> (1925).

         <b>
     Nor to repair where tenant is without fault.
    </b>
    - A tenant's covenant to "leave the premises in good repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted," did not bind the lessee to repair or rebuild if he was "without fault or negligence." Powell v. John E. Hughes Orphanage, <cite class="va_code">148 Va. 331</cite>, 138 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 637</cite> (1927).

     A tenant was bound only to pay for necessary and proper repairs,

     Covenant qualified by specifying certain repairs.
    </b>
    - A covenant in a lease to keep the building in repair, followed by a clause, separated from it only by a semicolon, that the tenant should replace all glass broken, and repair damages from bursting pipes, applies only to the repairs enumerated, and not to a destruction of the property. Richmond Ice Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., <cite class="va_code">99 Va. 239</cite>, 37 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 851</cite> (1901).

        <p>
         <b>
     Express agreement of parties controls.
    </b>
    - The provision in this section relieving a lessee of the duty to repair or rebuild is inapplicable where the parties have expressly agreed that the lessee should rebuild or renew the heating plant. In this situation, the express agreement of the parties controls. Zimmerman v. Savoy Hotel Corp., <cite class="va_code">199 Va. 73</cite>, 97 S.E.2d 727 (1957).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the tenant agreed in the lease that it would "be responsible for the breakage of all glass in the said premises . . . and to replace the same without delay, regardless of how the same was broken," this language showed the intention of the parties that the tenant would be bound for these repairs even though the tenant was free of fault or negligence.

     Covenant to repair does not make tenant liable for fire damage.
    </b>
    - Where a covenant to repair relates to the right of the lessees to make alterations and changes in the leased property, and to their duty to make needed repairs because of alterations, wear, tear and usage, containing no language showing the intent of the parties that the tenant should be personally bound for fire damage, such tenant is not liable for fire damage under this section.

         <b>
     The amount which a tenant is entitled to have his rent reduced

        <p>
         In an action by the landlord seeking to recover rent and an amount equal to the cost of replacing a collapsed building on the leased premises, the burden is upon the tenant, who has covenanted to leave the premises in good repair, to prove that the collapse of the building was not due to his fault or negligence.

      </h3>
      <p>
       If any tenant or lessee of nonresidential rental property who is in default in the payment of rent continues to be in default five days after receipt of written notice that requires possession of the premises or the payment of rent, such tenant or lessee forfeits his right to possession of the premises. In such case, the possession of the defendant may, at the option of the landlord or lessor, be deemed unlawful, and he may proceed to recover possession of the premises.

       The right to evict a tenant whose right of possession has been terminated in any nonresidential tenancy under this chapter may be effectuated by self-help eviction without further legal process so long as such eviction does not incite a breach of the peace. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude termination of any nonresidential tenancy by the filing of an unlawful detainer action as provided by Article 13 (<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-124" target="_blank">§ 8.01-124</a></cite> et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01, entry of an order of possession, and eviction pursuant to § 55.1-1416.

      </h3>
      <p>
       When goods are distrained or attached for rent reserved in a share of the crop, or in anything other than money, the claimant of the rent shall give the tenant 10 days' notice, and the claimant may then apply to the court to which the attachment is returnable, or the circuit court of the county or city in which the distress is made, to ascertain the value in money of the rent reserved and to order a sale of the goods distrained or attached. The tenant may make the same defenses that he could to a motion on a forfeited forthcoming bond given for rent and may also contest the value of what was reserved for the rent. The court shall ascertain, either by its own judgment or, if either party requires it, by the verdict of a jury impaneled without the formality of pleading, the extent of the liability of the tenant for rent and the value in money of such rent and if the tenant has been served with notice shall enter judgment against him for the amount so ascertained. It shall also order the goods distrained or attached, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to be sold to pay the amount so ascertained. The officer charged with the execution of such warrant or attachment shall return such warrant or attachment to the clerk's office of the court, showing how he has executed such warrant or attachment. If the goods so directed to be sold prove insufficient to pay the amount of the rent so ascertained, an execution may be issued on the judgment as in case of other judgments, which may be levied on such property as would be leviable under an execution issued on a judgment in an action brought to recover the rent.

       Any person who has a right of reentry into lands by reason of any rent issuing thereout being in arrear, or by reason of the breach of any covenant or condition, may serve a declaration in ejectment on the tenant in possession, if any, or, if the possession is vacant, by posting the declaration upon the front door of the building, or at any other notorious place on the premises, and such service shall be in lieu of a demand and reentry. Upon proof to the court, by affidavit in case of judgment by default or upon proof on the trial, that the rent claimed was due and no sufficient distress was upon the premises, or that the covenant or condition was broken before the service of the declaration and that the plaintiff had power to reenter, he shall recover judgment and have execution for such lands.

       "Land"
       is a three-dimensional concept and includes parcels with upper or lower boundaries, or both upper and lower boundaries, as well as parcels extending ab solo usque ad coelum. Parcels of airspace constitute land within the meaning of this chapter. Any requirement in this chapter of a legally sufficient description shall be deemed to include a requirement that the upper and lower boundaries, if any, of the parcel in question be identified with reference to established data.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Obligee"

      <p>
       "Residential ground rent"
       means a rent or charge paid for the use of land, whether or not title to such land is transferred to the user, or a lease of land, for personal residential purposes, (i) which is assignable by the obligor without the obligee's consent; (ii) which is for a term in excess of 15 years, including any rights of renewal at the option of the obligor; (iii) where the obligor has a present or future right to terminate such ground rent and to acquire the entire interest of the obligee in the land by the payment of a determined or determinable amount; and (iv) where the obligee's interest in the land is primarily a security interest to protect his right to be paid the rent or charge.

     Reentry clause is mere security for rent.
    </b>
    - It seems that a clause of reentry for nonpayment of rent is in general considered as a mere security for the rent, and that a forfeiture will not be enforced, although the demand for the rent be made, provided the tenant satisfies the rent due and compensates the landlord for any damages he may have sustained in consequence of the former's default.

         <b>
     Rule as to necessity for demand is unchanged.
    </b>
    - By an ancient rule of the common law, before a lessor can exercise a stipulated right of reentry for breach of covenant to pay rent, he must make an actual demand upon the tenant for the payment thereof, unless by special agreement the requirement of demand has been dispensed with. The rule as respects the necessity for demand remains unaltered in general by this section. Johnston v. Hargrove, <cite class="va_code">81 Va. 118</cite> (1885).

       If there is a tenant for life or other uncertain interest in land that is leased to another, upon the death of such tenant for life or termination of such other uncertain interest, the lessee may hold the land through the end of the current year of the tenancy, paying rent. The rent, if it is reserved in money, shall be apportioned between the tenant for life or other uncertain interest, or his personal representative, and those who succeed to the land. If rent is reserved in kind, it shall be paid to the tenant for life or other uncertain interest, or his personal representative, and the tenant or his personal representative, as the case may be, shall pay to those who succeed to the land a reasonable rent, in money, from the expiration of the life estate or other uncertain interest to the end of the current year of the tenancy. The rent to be paid to those who succeed to the land shall be a charge in preference to other claims on the rent received in kind by such tenant or his personal representative.

     "Declaration."
    </b>
    - Declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision fulfilled the qualifications of a "declaration" and an architectual control committee fulfilled the qualifications of a "property owners' association" because the declaration expressly imposed upon the committee a duty to maintain a road and authorized it to impose a variable assessment of one-sixth of the cost of such maintenance on the owners of each respective lot.

     "Property owners' association."
    </b>
    - Legislature has amended the code section in two places at the same time with divergent effects; the courts therefore must assume that the General Assembly intended the elements to be disjunctive in the statutory definition of "declaration" but conjunctive in the definition of "property owners' association." Shepherd v. Conde, <cite class="va_code">293 Va. 274</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Circuit court erred by ruling that amendments to the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision were binding only on some lot owners, to the exclusion of the contestants because the declaration and the identical language in one of the amendments allowed the owners to adopt the amendments by a two-thirds majority vote, and such amendments were binding on all owners; the changes were to the declaration in its entirety. Shepherd v. Conde, <cite class="va_code">293 Va. 274</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017).
        </p>
        <p>
         Home owners association did not fulfill either of the requirements to qualify as a "property owners' association" within the meaning of the Virginia Property Owners' Association Act because nothing in an amendment to the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision either imposed upon the association a duty to maintain a road or authorized it to impose assessments for the costs of such maintenance.

     Common area.

    - Demarcation of a road as an easement on the plat incorporated into the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision was sufficient to fulfill the designation requirement of the definition of "common area"; property need not be conveyed or leased to a property owners' association to qualify as "common area" so long as the association is required to maintain the property for the use of its members and the property is designated as common area in the declaration.

     §§
    
    55-508 through 55-517.2, as it could not identify a document recorded in the land records of the jurisdiction where some property of the development was located, expressly requiring the association to maintain the common areas or roads; the duty had to be expressly stated in the recorded documents and could not be inferred or implied.

        <b>
         No right to rescind based on updates.
        </b>
        - Clause (iii) of subsection A permits a real estate purchaser to cancel a contract within three days after receiving a Property Owners' Association Act disclosure packet, or upon notice that a packet will not be available. That same section also permits a purchaser who has received a packet to request an update in clause (iv) of subsection A. However, a plain reading of the statute shows that the purchaser has no direct right under this clause to rescind the contract based on requested updates. Daly v. Gulick Grp., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 186, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Fairfax County May 11, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nowhere does
        §
        55-509.4 give a purchaser the right to rescind a purchase contract if he requests an update to a disclosure packet and the seller or homeowners' association fails to timely provide the update, or if the packet is incomplete.

         Cancellation under subsection C.
        </b>
        - Last sentence of subsection C of
        §
        55-509.4 allows the purchaser to cancel the contract at any time prior to settlement if the purchaser has not been notified that the association disclosure packet will not be available and the association disclosure packet is not delivered to the purchaser. This sentence predicates a rescission right on (1) a lack of notification of unavailability and (2) non-deliverability. It applies to those cases where a purchaser gets nothing from the seller. Daly v. Gulick Grp., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 186, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Fairfax County May 11, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection C of
        §
        55-509.4 simply references the means in which a disclosure packet update or financial update may be requested. The rest of subsection C lists out the means by which a purchaser may cancel the contract, none of which relate to a request for an updated packet. The fact that the legislature provides a mechanism for requesting a disclosure packet does not act to create a new contractual rescission period unless the legislature expressly says so by its statute. In this case, the legislature has not provided rescission as a remedy when a purchaser receives an outdated or incomplete disclosure package. Daly v. Gulick Grp., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 186, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Fairfax County May 11, 2018).

        - Seller's demurrer was sustained as to the purchasers' breach of contract, declaratory relief, and rescission claims where the seller had delivered a disclosure packet, albeit one that was allegedly outdated or incomplete, and the purchasers had not unilaterally cancelled the contract within three days of delivery. Daly v. Gulick Grp., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 186, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Fairfax County May 11, 2018).

     Homeowners association may limit units offered for rent by single owner.
    </b>
    - If properly written, adopted and enforced, authorized as to purpose and not in conflict with an association's declarations, bylaws or rules and regulations, a homeowners' association may covenant to limit the number of housing units within the association that may be offered for rent by the owner to tenants.

     Developer's control of homeowners' association.
    </b>
    - Since the Virginia Property Owners Act does not expressly provide or otherwise allow for a developer to maintain control of a homeowners' association for a specific period of time or until a specific number of lots or units are sold, there is no Virginia Code provision to evaluate for constitutionality.

Reeves, Member, Senate of Virginia,<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.12.html#t12c12-104" target="_blank"> 12-104</a></cite>, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/11/13).

Rules and regulations may be adopted by resolution and shall be reasonably published or distributed throughout the development. At a special meeting of the association convened in accordance with the provisions of the association's bylaws, a majority of votes cast at such meeting may repeal or amend any rule or regulation adopted by the board of directors.

    - This act vests in a majority of members, as members of a property owners' association, the right to "repeal or amend any rule or regulation adopted by the board of directors" if such rule or regulation has been adopted by the board with respect to use of the common areas.

        <p>
         Given the language of this section and where association members must submit to these rules, regulations, and binding policies as long as they own homes in the community, the proposal at issue if enacted by majority vote, would merely impose limitations upon the board's powers authorized by this code section.

         Real estate developer's right to vote.
        </b>
        - Homeowners association could levy assessments against the developer of the real estate subdivision, as a lot owner, for proper expenses for the common area and amenities of the subdivision. However, under the terms of the declaration, the association could not bar the developer from exercising a right to vote granted by the declaration simply by adopting by-laws in conflict with the declaration.

         Violations constituted a single violation.

        - Although a homeowners association asked the court to charge the owner for 41 separate violations, the court found that the various alleged violations amounted to one overriding violation, the failure to comply with the application approved by the association to build her house; therefore, the association was entitled to an assessment against the lot in the amount of $10 to be assessed for a period of 90 days, for a total of $900, for the owner's continuing failure to comply with the approved application.

         Standing.
        </b>
        - Homeowners' association member had standing to sue a neighbor and the neighbor's agent for common area damage because (1) an applicable declaration did not bar standing, (2) another applicable declaration allowed standing, and (3) subsection A of
        §
        55-515 and this section gave the homeowners' association no exclusive authority to sue, as the legislature gave a condominium owners' association such authority but did not do so in the Virginia Property Owners' Association Act, so the member had standing in a "proper case," and this was such a case, since the homeowners' association was not statutorily or contractually obligated to act.

        - When a property owner filed three actions against a property owner's association, two of which were dismissed, the association could not, in the third action, recover attorney's fees against the owner as the prevailing party in the first two cases, under

        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        55-508 et seq., because it did not seek such relief in those cases and, under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, the trial court lost jurisdiction to award it 21 days after entering a final order dismissing the cases, as it did not retain jurisdiction to award attorney's fees at a later time, so the property owner was entitled to summary judgment as to the association's request for fees in the prior cases.

        Where there was a lack of actual controversy, rendering the action moot, and as no judgment could have been awarded, there could have been no prevailing party under the Virginia Supreme Court's definition for an award of attorney's fees and costs; therefore, the matter had to be dismissed.

       <p>
        Declarations governing the owner's association and its members and this statute required the court to award plaintiff its reasonable attorney fees and costs as the time and effort expended by plaintiff's attorneys was substantial given the history of the case; the nature and complexity of the services exceeded that of a standard breach of contract case; plaintiff's attorneys obtained the result plaintiff sought; and plaintiff's claimed fees were reasonable.

     Developer's control of homeowners' association.
    </b>
    - Since the Virginia Property Owners Act does not expressly provide or otherwise allow for a developer to maintain control of a homeowners' association for a specific period of time or until a specific number of lots or units are sold, there is no Virginia Code provision to evaluate for constitutionality.

    - Subsection F is conspicuously precise, requiring the certification to verify that the requisite majority signed the amendment or ratifications thereof, and there is a difference between adopting an amendment and signing it or some written ratification of it; subsection F demands the extra precaution of requiring the members voting in favor of an amendment verify that vote with their signatures, no doubt to discourage quarrelsome disputes between neighbors about who voted for what and when. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Property Owners' Association Act authorizes the creation and enforcement of restrictive covenants against nonconsenting landowners in a manner unknown to the common law; the General Assembly policed the imposition of these covenants with strict procedural requirements, not the least of which is the plainly worded command that no recorded amendment shall be "effective" unless it is accompanied by a certification verifying the requisite majority signed the amendment or a ratification of it. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         General Assembly created something entirely new to the law, the right to form private associations having power over land use, while adding precautions to honor the common law's ancient antipathy toward restrictions on the free use of private property. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).

         <b>
     Declarant could provide for unilateral amendment of declaration.
    </b>
    - Subdivision's declaration of protective covenants contained a provision for unilateral amendment of the declaration by the developer for a two-year period; this provision was not inconsistent with subsection D of
    
     §
    
    55-515.1 and subsection F of
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    55-515.2 because these statutes provided ancillary means for amending the declaration. Nothing in the Property Owners' Association Act prohibited the declarant from making express provisions in the declaration for a different manner of amending the declaration. Zinone v. Lee's Crossing Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">282 Va. 330</cite>, 714 S.E.2d 922, 2011 Va. LEXIS 186 (2011).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Statute of limitations.
    </b>
    - Circuit court erred in granting a homeowners' association's special plea in bar and dismissing property owners' case as untimely under subsection E, because the one-year limitations period ran only from the date of an "effective" amendment, and a proper certification pursuant to subsection F was not satisfied. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection E begins to run the limitations period when the amendment becomes effective under subsection F, and that interpretation does not offend logic or render the statute inoperable; a challenge to the validity of an amendment can be asserted on grounds other than its failure to become effective under subsection F, and in such circumstances, the challenge could still be barred by the limitations period in subsection E. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Literal reading of subsection E does not create an irreconcilable inconsistency in the statutory text; just the opposite is true because a literal reading avoids the most basic of textual inconsistencies, the same word meaning two different things in the same statute. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, <cite class="va_code">291 Va. 269</cite>, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016).

       "Condominium"
       means real property, and any incidents to or interests in such real property, lawfully subject to this chapter by the recordation of condominium instruments pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

      </p>
      <p>
       "Condominium instruments"
       means, collectively, the declaration, bylaws, and plats and plans recorded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Any exhibit, schedule, or certification recorded with a condominium instrument shall be deemed an integral part of that condominium instrument. Once recorded, any amendment or certification of any condominium instrument shall be deemed an integral part of the affected condominium instrument if such amendment or certification was made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

"Declarant" does not include an individual who acquires title to a condominium unit at a foreclosure sale.

       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Officer"
       means any member of the executive board or official of the unit owners' association.

      <p>

         - State court order was quite clear and, contrary to a bankruptcy court's interpretation, stated that debtor's restaurant unit was subject to assessment for the common expenses relating to a condominium owners' association's operation and management, clearly defined such expenses, and fixed the unit's proportionate liability. Order accorded with the purpose of the default catch-all rule in the Virginia Condominium Act and reached a fundamentally fair result, effectively taxing debtor at a rate commensurate with its representation in the condominium's governing body and, by disallowing association's proof of claim, bankruptcy court erred by failing to give full preclusive effect to the state court's order.

     Condominium constituted integral part of property regime when master deed recorded.
    </b>
    - Under the Horizontal Property Act of 1962 and the Condominium Act of 1974, 264 units and their associated elements, i.e., the entire condominium, were constituted, not physically, but as an integral part of an established property regime when the master deed of the condominium was recorded.

     Treatment of condominium in which no units have been transferred.

    - The court rejected developer's contention that this section requires a taxing authority to treat a condominium in which no units have been transferred as a single parcel. This section permits the taxing authority to assess individually each completed unit in a condominium project without regard to ownership, and to include in that assessment a proportional share of the assessment of common areas of the project which are not subject to withdrawal or conversion by the declarant.

     Assessment of individual condominium units.
    </b>
    - All assessments of real estate shall be at their fair market value, and the court concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking the taxpayer's evidence because the taxpayer's burden to prove that real property was assessed at more than its fair market value necessarily required that the taxpayer establish the property's fair market value. Because the real property at issue consisted of condominium units, the taxpayer was required to, but failed to, produce evidence to show the fair market value of each individual unit pursuant to
    
     §
    
    55-79.42; moreover, to the extent there were market-driven impediments to selling the units individually and limitations on the rental income that could be realized, such factors may affect each unit's fair market value, but they did not alter the statutory requirement that condominiums be treated as separate parcels of real estate and be separately assessed or the taxpayer's burden to establish each unit's fair market value in order to show that its real property was assessed at more than fair market value as required by subsection A of

The provisions of this subsection shall not apply, however, to any withdrawable land in a contractable condominium, nor shall any provision of this subsection be construed to prohibit the unit owners' association from mortgaging or causing a deed of trust to be placed on any portion of the condominium within which no units are located, so long as the period of declarant control specified in § 55.1-1943 has expired and so long as the bylaws authorize such action.

        - Subcontractors' liens, which were directed toward an association of condominium owners, were valid despite the fact that the liens included some 40 units that were considered public property and owned by the county because the 940 unreleased unit owners did not suffer a shift in the lien burden from the 40 released units; instead, the percentage of indebtedness had already been apportioned, and it remained apportioned in the same amount. The lien was not invalidated - rather, it merely could not be enforced against the units owned by the county. Belle View Condos. v. Drytech, Inc., 65 Va. Cir. 169, 2004 Va. Cir.

        §
        55-79.39 et seq., and the condominium instruments by the declarant vis-a-vis the purchasers' unit and their ability to live in that unit. Thus, the case was a proper case for the unit owners to bring the action under subsection A of

        There are two ways that unit owners are able to sue for noncompliance with the Condominium Act,
        §
        55-79.39 et seq., and/or the condominium instruments: (1) where the claim is based on the violation of some individual right; or (2) where the claim is (i) based on the violation of a right common to all unit owners, and (ii) the unit owners' association fails or refuses to assert the common right.

       <p>
        Condominium unit purchasers alleged a violation of both warranties with respect to their unit; they stated that their unit was not fit for habitation, nor was it free from structural defects, as it contained water leaks, mold growth, excessive levels of carbon monoxide, and dangerous levels of volatile organic compounds, all of which made them sick and forced them to abandon their unit. The purchasers alleged that all of this happened during the warranty period. Millisor v. Anchor Point Ventures, L.L.C., 77 Va. Cir. 246, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 278 (Hopewell 2008).

        55-79.53 of the Virginia Condominium Act, a unit owner could bring a class action suit if the owners' association failed to assert the owners' common right; however, there was not a procedure for a person to maintain a class action, and a condominium unit owner did not seek damages on behalf of other owners.

        - In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development that was purportedly assigned by a prior owner to a different unit owner, the various controlling statutory provisions were to be read together because, based on the statutory language, the general requirement that mortgagee consent was required was not supplanted by a specific rule.

         Assignment of parking space a nullity.
        </b>
        - In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, when the prior unit owner failed to obtained the consent of the trustees on the deed of trust before reassigning the parking space to a different unit owner, he violated the statutory provision that required their prior consent, such that he lost his statutory right to assign the parking space, and his subsequent purported assignment thereof was a nullity.

       <p>
        In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, as the proper consent of the trustees of the deed of trust was not obtained prior to an attempted assignment of a unit owner's parking space, the assignment was a nullity, such that upon foreclosure of the owner's unit, the successful bidder purchased title to both the unit and the space.

        - Although the requirements of subsections A and B of
        §
        55-79.57 were not met in that the purported conveyance of a storage area was not reflected by the condominium instruments as an amendment to the condominium instruments was never recorded, the storage area was conveyed to owners' association because the doctrine of estoppel by deed applied; as between parties to a 1988 deed, including any successors-in-interest, the deed evidenced a clear and unambiguous conveyance of the storage area for good and valuable consideration. The limited liability company's claim for ejectment was in derogation of the 1988 deed. Gordon Props., LLC v. First Owners' Ass'n of Forty Six Hundred Condo., Inc., 79 Va. Cir. 683, 2009 Va. Cir.

        There shall be recorded simultaneously with the declaration one or more plats of survey showing the location and dimensions of the submitted land, the location and dimensions of any convertible lands within the submitted land, the location and dimensions of any existing improvements, the intended location and dimensions of any contemplated improvements that are to be located on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands, and, to the extent feasible, the location and dimensions of all easements appurtenant to the submitted land or otherwise subject to this chapter as a part of the common elements. If the submitted land is not contiguous, then the plats shall indicate the distances between the parcels constituting the submitted land. The plats shall label every convertible land as a convertible land, and if there is more than one such land, the plats shall label each such land with one or more letters or numbers different from those designating any other convertible land and different also from the identifying number of any unit. The plats shall show the location and dimensions of any withdrawable lands and shall label each such land as a withdrawable land. The plats shall show the location and dimensions of any additional lands and shall label each such land as an additional land. If, with respect to any portion, but less than all, of the submitted land, the unit owners are to own only an estate for years, the plats shall show the location and dimensions of any such portion, and shall label each such portion as a leased land. If there is more than one withdrawable land, or more than one leased land, the plats shall label each such land with one or more letters or numbers different from those designating any convertible land or other withdrawable or leased land, and different also from the identifying number of any unit. The plats shall show all easements to which the submitted land or any portion of such submitted land is subject and shall show the location and dimensions of all such easements to the extent feasible. The plats shall also show all encroachments by or on any portion of the condominium. In the case of any improvements located or to be located on any portion of the submitted land other than within the boundaries of any convertible lands, the plats shall indicate which, if any, have not been begun by the use of the phrase "NOT YET BEGUN" and which, if any, have been begun but have not been substantially completed by the use of the phrase "NOT YET COMPLETED." In the case of any units the vertical boundaries of which lie wholly or partially outside of structures for which plans pursuant to subsection B are simultaneously recorded, the plats shall show the location and dimensions of such vertical boundaries to the extent that they are not shown on such plans, and the units or portions thereof thus depicted shall bear their identifying numbers. Each plat shall be certified in a recorded document as to its accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this subsection by a licensed land surveyor, and the surveyor shall certify in such document or on the face of the plat that all units or portions of such units depicted on such plat pursuant to the preceding sentence of this subsection have been substantially completed. The specification within this subsection of items that shall be shown on the plats shall not be construed to mean that the plats shall not also show all other items customarily shown or hereafter required for land title surveys.

The plans shall show the location and dimensions of the vertical boundaries of each unit to the extent that such boundaries lie within or coincide with the boundaries of such structures, and the units or portions of the submitted units so depicted shall bear their identifying numbers. In addition, each convertible space so depicted shall be labeled as convertible space. The horizontal boundaries of each unit having horizontal boundaries shall be identified on the plans with reference to established datum. Unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise, it shall be presumed that in the case of any unit not wholly contained within or constituting one or more such structures, the horizontal boundaries thus identified extend, in the case of each such unit, at the same elevation with regard to any part of such unit, lying outside of such structures, subject to the following exception: In the case of any such unit that does not lie over any other unit other than basement units, it shall be presumed that the lower horizontal boundary, if any, of that unit lies at the level of the ground with regard to any part of that unit lying outside of such structures. The plans shall be certified on their face or in another recorded document as to their accuracy and compliance with the provisions of this subsection by a licensed architect, licensed engineer, or licensed land surveyor, and such architect, engineer, or land surveyor shall certify on the plans or in the recorded document that all units or portions of the submitted units depicted on such plans have been substantially completed.

Any such contraction shall be deemed to have occurred at the time of the recordation of an amendment to the declaration, executed by the declarant, containing a legal description by metes and bounds of the land withdrawn from the condominium. If portions of the withdrawable land were described pursuant to subdivision D 5 of § 55.1-1916, then no such portion shall be so withdrawn after the conveyance of any unit on such portion. If no such portions were described, then none of the withdrawable land shall be withdrawn after the first conveyance of any unit.

     Error in declaration not scrivener's error subject to unilateral amendment.
    </b>
    - Trial court erred in finding that the inclusion of a parcel of real estate within the property description submitted with a condominium declaration was a scrivener's error subject to unilateral amendment by the condominium declarant under subsection F, because the error, though contrary to the declarant's intent, was neither typographical nor clerical and was not an inadvertent, singular mistake, easily understood with reference to the remainder of the condominium declaration.

If the mortgagee has not supplied an address to the unit owners' association, the unit owners' association shall be deemed to have received the written consent of a mortgagee if the unit owners' association sends the text of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee at the address filed in the land records or with the local tax assessor's office and receives no written objection to the adoption of the amendment from the mortgagee within 60 days of the date that the notice of amendment is sent by the unit owners' association, unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise.

         Purported assignment affected mortgagee's rights.

        - Uncertainty as to the proper ownership of a parking space that was purportedly transferred by a prior condominium owner to a different unit owner prior to foreclosure on the prior owner's unit specifically affected the mortgagee's rights.

         Interpretation.
        </b>
        - In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development that was purportedly assigned by a prior owner to a different unit owner, the various controlling statutory provisions were to be read together because, based on the statutory language, the general requirement that mortgagee consent was required was not supplanted by a specific rule.

         Assignment of parking space a nullity.
        </b>
        - In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, when the prior unit owner failed to obtained the consent of the trustees on the deed of trust before reassigning the parking space to a different unit owner, he violated the statutory provision that required their prior consent, such that he lost his statutory right to assign the parking space, and his subsequent purported assignment thereof was a nullity.

The two-year warranty as to each of the common elements begins whenever that common element has been completed or, if later, (i) as to any common element within any additional land or portion of the additional land, at the time the first unit in that additional land is conveyed; (ii) as to any common element within any convertible land or portion of the convertible land, at the time the first unit in the convertible land is conveyed; and (iii) as to any common element within any other portion of the condominium, at the time the first unit in that portion is conveyed. For the purposes of this subsection, no unit shall be deemed conveyed unless conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. Any conveyance of a condominium unit transfers to the purchaser all of the declarant's warranties against structural defects imposed by this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, structural defects shall be those defects in components constituting any unit or common element that reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and that require repair, renovation, restoration, or replacement.

However, no such action shall be maintained against the declarant unless a written statement by the claimant, or his agent, attorney, or representative, of the nature of the alleged defect has been sent to the declarant by registered or certified mail at his last known address, as reflected in the records of the Common Interest Community Board, more than six months prior to the beginning of the action giving the declarant an opportunity to cure the alleged defect within a reasonable time, not to exceed five months.

Within 30 days after such notice, the local governing body or an agency designated by the local governing body shall advise the chair of the committee of any outstanding violations of applicable building codes, local ordinances, or other deficiencies of record.

     Warranty on common elements of condominium project.
    </b>
    - Subsection B extends to each purchaser of a condominium unit a two-year warranty against structural defects in his unit, beginning on the date of delivery of the deed to his individual unit. By contrast, the General Assembly did not provide for staggered warranty periods on the common elements dating from the delivery of individual deeds to the respective units, but chose instead to date that warranty from a single, readily ascertainable time: completion of the structure or conveyance of the first unit, whichever occurs later. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 98</cite>, 348 S.E.2d 252 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsection B imposes a warranty during the two-year period which begins on either the date of completion or the date of conveyance of the first unit, whichever date is later. The warranty expires, however, two years after its commencement, and the dates of delivery of deeds conveying units subsequent to the first have no effect upon it. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 98</cite>, 348 S.E.2d 252 (1986).

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Warranty period defines when cause of action for breach may accrue.
    </b>
    - The two-year warranty period provided by subsection B is not a limitation governing the assertion of a right of action; rather, it defines the period within which a cause of action for breach of warranty may accrue. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, <cite class="va_code">232 Va. 98</cite>, 348 S.E.2d 252 (1986).
        </p>
        <p>
         The two-year warranty period in subsection B circumscribes the interval of time within which the warranty exists. If a breach occurs before the two-year warranty expires, a cause of action accrues. If a person suffers damage or injury as a result of the breach, a right of action accrues to him.

        55-79.79, by claiming that defendants warranted that the building was free of structural defects and constructed in a workmanlike manner so as to pass without objection in the trade. That some of the alleged defects of the property may have arisen from structural defects that were allowed to go uncorrected did not prove that the problems were outside the bounds of the warranty.

The purchasers alleged that all of this happened during the warranty period. Millisor v. Anchor Point Ventures, L.L.C., 77 Va. Cir. 246, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 278 (Hopewell 2008).

          Assessment in proportion to votes.

         - State court order was quite clear and, contrary to a bankruptcy court's interpretation, stated that debtor's restaurant unit was subject to assessment for the common expenses relating to a condominium owners' association's operation and management, clearly defined such expenses, and fixed the unit's proportionate liability. Order accorded with the purpose of the default catch-all rule in the Virginia Condominium Act and reached a fundamentally fair result, effectively taxing debtor at a rate commensurate with its representation in the condominium's governing body and, by disallowing association's proof of claim, bankruptcy court erred by failing to give full preclusive effect to the state court's order.

     Priority of lien for unpaid assessments.
    </b>
    - A circuit court erred in approving a distribution of the proceeds from the sale of a condominium that gave priority to the attorney's fees, costs, and repair expenses incurred by the condominium association in instituting and maintaining the suit to enforce the association's lien and in selling the property, over the sums unpaid on a first deed of trust recorded prior to the perfection of the association's lien for assessments. Although the association had a valid claim under subsection E for the sums sought, under subsection A, that claim was inferior to the claim of the holder of the first deed of trust.

     Priority of lien for unpaid assessments.

    - A circuit court erred in approving a distribution of the proceeds from the sale of a condominium that gave priority to the attorney's fees, costs, and repair expenses incurred by the condominium association in instituting and maintaining the suit to enforce the association's lien and in selling the property, over the sums unpaid on a first deed of trust recorded prior to the perfection of the association's lien for assessments. Although the association had a valid claim under subsection E for the sums sought, under subsection A, that claim was inferior to the claim of the holder of the first deed of trust.

     Compromise of claim as to "full and accurate disclosure" requirement.

    - A condominium unit owners' association had the authority to compromise, over the objection of individual unit owners, a claim against the condominium developer alleging that in the sale of condominium units, the developer had violated the "full and accurate disclosure" requirement of this section by representing to prospective purchasers that a parcel of land, which appeared to be included in the condominium project, would be improved as a park for use of unit owners when in fact the parcel was not part of the condominium project, was zoned for commercial use, and was intended by the developer to be sold for commercial development and alleging that commercial use of the disputed parcel would violate restrictive covenants to which the parcel was subject.

Until the expiration of the 120-day period, the declarant shall have no right of access to the unit except as provided by subsection A of § 55.1-1229 and except that, upon 45 days' written notice to the tenant, the declarant may enter the unit in order to make additional repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements, provided that (i) the making of the same does not constitute an actual or constructive eviction of the tenant and (ii) such entry is made either with the consent of the tenant or only at times when the tenant is absent from the unit. The declarant shall also provide general notice to the tenants of the condominium or proposed condominium at the time of application to the Common Interest Community Board in addition to the formal notice required by this subsection.

          Corporation not liable where it did not exercise control over deposits.

         - Corporation was granted summary judgment where there was no genuine issue of material fact that the corporation ever controlled any deposits or conspired in any way with a seller or a non-party from whom the seller received financing regarding misappropriation because (1) it was clear that the buyers gave their deposits to the seller and the seller returned the deposits with funds from the non-party, (2) nothing within the agreement between the non-party and the corporation established that the parties acted in concert to misappropriate the deposits, and (3) the corporation could not have been held liable when it did not exercise any of the rights it may have inherited from the non-party.

        If a lien is filed against two or more apartments and their respective percentage interest in the common elements, the apartment owners of the separate apartments may remove their apartments and their percentage interests in the common elements appurtenant to such apartments from the lien by payment of the fractional or proportional amounts attributable to each of the apartments affected, or they may file a written undertaking with surety approved by the court. Such individual payment, or amount of bond, shall be computed by reference to the percentage established pursuant to the bylaws of the horizontal property regime. After such partial payment, filing of bond, partial discharge, or release, or other satisfaction, the apartment and its percentage interest in the common elements shall be free and clear of such lien. Such partial payment, indemnity, satisfaction, or discharge shall not prevent the lienor from proceeding to enforce its rights against any apartment and its percentage interest in the common elements not so paid, indemnified, satisfied, or discharged.

Unless at that meeting a majority of all the proprietary lessees or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the proprietary lessees shall be continued until such time as the proprietary lessees ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board.

A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of that period, but in that event he may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.

To the extent that the declaration so provides, the members of the executive board appointed by the declarant may continue to serve out their terms, and the declarant may continue to appoint a minority of the members of the executive board until all of the development rights reserved by the declarant have been exercised or have expired. In addition, the declaration may provide for the selection of one or more independent members of the executive board, who are neither proprietary lessees nor affiliated directly or indirectly in any way with the declarant, by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the executive board.

       If entered into before the executive board elected by the proprietary lessees pursuant to subsection F of § 55.1-2134 takes office, (i) any management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities, (ii) any other contract or lease between the association and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant, or (iii) any contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the proprietary lessees at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing may be terminated without penalty by the association at any time after the executive board elected by the proprietary lessees pursuant to subsection F of § 55.1-2134 takes office after giving at least 90 days' notice to the other party. However, a management contract that is not unconscionable between an association directly or indirectly providing assisted living or nursing services to proprietary lessees and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant may not be terminated while a member of the executive board appointed by the declarant continues to serve unless such termination is approved by a vote of a majority of the members of the executive board and a majority vote of the proprietary lessees, other than the declarant.

       This section does not apply to any proprietary lease or any lease the termination of which would terminate the cooperative or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to that lease was included in the cooperative for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section. This section does not apply to any contract, incidental to the disposition of a cooperative interest, to provide to a proprietary lessee for the duration of such proprietary lessee's life, or for any term in excess of one year, nursing services, medical services, other health-related services, board and lodging, and care as necessary, or any combination of such services. The rule of property law known as the rule restricting unreasonable restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat any provision of the declaration, bylaws, or proprietary leases requiring that the proprietary lessees be parties to such contracts.

        The association has a lien on a cooperative interest for any assessment levied against that cooperative interest or fines imposed against its owner from the time the assessment or fines become due. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged pursuant to subdivisions A 11 and 12 of § 55.1-2133 are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment becomes due. Upon nonpayment of the assessment, the proprietary lessee may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section. The association's lien may be foreclosed (i) by judicial sale in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or (ii) by power of sale as provided in subsection I.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1sIVc21a03s55.1-2148ol1B">
        A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a cooperative interest except (i) liens and encumbrances on the cooperative that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (ii) any first security interest encumbering only the cooperative interest of a proprietary lessee and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the cooperative or the cooperative interest. The lien is also prior to the security interests described in clause (ii) to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-2133 that would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. The lien under this section is not subject to homestead or other exemptions.
       </li>
       <li id="t55.1sIVc21a03s55.1-2148ol1C">
        Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority.

       <li id="t55.1sIVc21a03s55.1-2148ol1D">
        Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation or filing of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.

The association shall give to the proprietary lessee and any sublessees of the proprietary lessee reasonable written notice of the time and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private disposition may be made. The same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a recorded interest in the cooperative interest that would be cut off by the sale, but only if the interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required by this subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. Sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not related to the association, at a private sale.

The person conducting the sale under subsection I shall execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the cooperative interest that states that the conveyance is executed by him, after a foreclosure by power of sale of the association's lien and that he has power to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required by subsection I are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of his authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the conveyance.

        A declarant of a cooperative containing conversion buildings shall give each of the tenants of a conversion building formal notice of the conversion at the time the cooperative is registered by the Common Interest Community Board. This notice shall advise each tenant of (i) the offering price of the cooperative interests for the unit he occupies; (ii) the projected common expense assessments against that cooperative interest for at least the first year of the cooperative's operation; (iii) any relocation services, public or private, of which the declarant is aware; (iv) any measure taken or to be taken by the declarant to reduce the incidence of tenant dislocation; and (v) the details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant, to assist tenants in relocating. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than 120 days' notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Until the expiration of the 120-day period, the declarant shall have no right of access to the unit except as provided in this section and in subsection A of § 55.1-1229 except that, upon 45 days' written notice to the tenant, the declarant may enter the unit in order to make additional repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements, provided that (a) the making of the same does not constitute an actual or constructive eviction of the tenant and (b) such entry is made either with the consent of the tenant or only at times when the tenant is absent from the unit. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession. The declarant shall also provide general notice to the tenants of the cooperative or proposed cooperative at the time of application to the Common Interest Community Board, in addition to the formal notice required by this subsection.

        For 60 days after delivery or mailing of the formal notice described in subsection B, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases the unit associated with that cooperative interest. A specific statement of the purchase price and the amount of any initial or special cooperative fee due from the purchaser on or before settlement of the purchase contract and the basis of such fee shall be given to the tenant. If a tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that 60-day period, the offeror shall not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following 180 days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit that is part of that cooperative interest will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion.

        If a seller, in violation of subsection C, conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection C to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed states that the seller has complied with subsection C but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection C.

The details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant for assisting tenants in relocating, shall also be provided to the tenant.

        Any locality may require by ordinance that the declarant of a conversion cooperative file with that governing body all information required by the Common Interest Community Board pursuant to § 55.1-2176 and a copy of the formal notice required by subsection B. Such information shall be filed with that governing body when the application for registration is filed with the Common Interest Community Board, and such copy of the formal notice shall be filed with that governing body whenever it is sent to tenants. No fee shall be imposed for such filings with a governing body.

The reimbursement shall not be required to exceed the amount that the tenant would have been entitled to receive under §§ 25.1-407 and 25.1-415 if the real estate comprising the condominium had been condemned by the Department of Highways and Transportation.

       The clerk in whose office such memorandum is filed as provided in this subsection shall record and index such memorandum as provided in this subsection, in the names of the persons identified in such memorandum as well as in the name of the time-share estates owners' association. The cost of recording such memorandum shall be taxed against the owner of the time-share on which the lien is placed. The filing with the clerk of one memorandum on which is listed two or more delinquent time-share estate unit owners is permitted in order to perfect the lien hereby allowed, and the cost of filing in this event shall be the clerk's fee as prescribed in subdivision A 2 of § 17.1-275.

       When payment or satisfaction is made of a debt secured by the lien perfected by this subsection, such lien shall be released in accordance with the provisions of § 55.1-339.

        A time-share project may be terminated in whole by the developer at any time and for any reason if such developer is the sole owner of all time-shares within the time-share project. Such termination shall be accomplished by the developer executing and recording a termination document where the time-share instrument is recorded. Time-shares subject to this section also may be terminated by written agreement of the time-share owners having at least 51 percent of the time-shares or by written agreement of such larger percentage of the time-share owners as may otherwise be provided in the time-share instrument.

If the termination agreement does not set forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract under which an estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares are to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, the termination agreement becomes effective upon recordation, and title to an estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares therein vests upon termination in the time-share owners in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection F.

The appraisal shall also state the corresponding fractional or percentage interests calculated in proportion to those values and in accordance with this subsection. A notice stating all of those values and corresponding interests and the return address of the sender shall be sent by certified or registered mail, by the managing entity or the trustee designated in the termination agreements, to all of the time-share owners. The appraisal governs the magnitude of each interest unless (i) at least 25 percent of the time-share owners deliver, within 60 days after the date the notices were mailed, written disapprovals to the return address of the sender of the notice or (ii) the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered during or after that period, holds that the appraisal should be set aside. The appraisal and the calculation of interests shall be made in accordance with the following:

    - In the context of ownership of land, "record title" is generally used to describe ownership of a particular parcel of real property by the person in whose name title appears in the official deed records, in contrast to one who claims ownership through unrecorded documents. The person with record title is the owner of the property with the power to encumber or transfer it. High Knob Assocs. v. Douglas, <cite class="va_code">249 Va. 478</cite>, 457 S.E.2d 349 (1995).

The foregoing shall not be deemed to apply to any purchaser at foreclosure or grantee in a deed in lieu of foreclosure, provided that the purchaser or grantee is a financial institution and the mortgagee, creditor, or beneficiary under the instrument being foreclosed or giving rise to the deed in lieu of foreclosure.

       The clerk in whose office the memorandum is filed shall record and index such memorandum as provided in this subsection, in the names of the persons identified in such memorandum, as well as in the name of the association. The cost of recording the memorandum shall be taxed against the person found liable for any judgment or order enforcing such lien. It is lawful for the memorandum to be filed as one statement listing the information required in subdivisions 1 through 4 and each of the lot owners whose property within the subdivision is liened. The cost of filing shall be as provided in subdivision A 2 of § 17.1-275.

      <p>
       No action to enforce any lien perfected under this subsection shall be brought after one year from the time when the memorandum of lien was recorded; however, the filing of a petition to enforce any such lien in any action in which such petition may be properly filed shall be regarded as the institution of an action under this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to extend the time within which any such lien may be perfected. Nothing shall preclude the association from filing a single action listing all unpaid delinquent and enumerated lot owners as defendants and obtaining judgment against those so adjudicated by the court hearing the action.

      <p>
       The judgment in an action brought pursuant to this subsection shall include, without limitation, reimbursement for costs and attorney fees, together with the interest at the maximum lawful rate for the sums secured by the lien from the time each sum became due and payable.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When payment or satisfaction is made of a debt secured by the lien perfected by this subsection, the lien shall be released in accordance with the provisions of § 55.1-339. For the purposes of § 55.1-339, the president or secretary of the association is the duly authorized agent of the lien creditor.

       Any lot owner within the subdivision having executed a contract for the disposition of the lot is entitled, upon request, to a recordable statement setting forth the amount of unpaid regular or special assessments currently levied against that lot. Such request shall be in writing, directed to the president of the association, and delivered to the principal office of the association. Failure of the association to furnish or make available such a statement within five business days from the receipt of such written request shall extinguish the lien created by this subsection as to the lot involved. Payment of a fee not exceeding $15 may be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of such a statement if the bylaws of the association so provide.

          although he directed his executors to sell the property and divide the proceeds among his heirs, since the land was never sold. When the conversion was intended for a particular purpose, and the purpose fails, equity regards the owner as not having directed a conversion. The purpose of dividing the proceeds from the sale of real estate among the immediate heirs was never carried out. Therefore there was no equitable conversion and the land retained its character as real property. United States v. 198.73 Acres of Land, 800 F.2d 434 (4th Cir. 1986).

           Commonwealth estopped from taking inconsistent positions.
          </b>
          - Where the Commonwealth took the position that the heirs were entitled to six percent of the condemnation proceeds and that the Commonwealth was entitled to the other 94%, it was estopped from taking a view inconsistent with its previous position since had the heirs abandoned the property, they would not have been entitled to receive any of the proceeds. One premise of the Commonwealth's position before the district court, therefore, must have been that the third-party defendants had not abandoned the property.

           Necessity for inquest.
          </b>
          - When the title to land fails from defect of heirs, or when from any cause there ceases to be an individual proprietor of the land, it reverts back to the community, and inquest of office is necessary. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291 (1876).
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Nature and purpose of inquest.
          </b>
          - An inquest does not constitute an escheat. It is simply the means by which the State furnishes authentic record evidence of her title. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291 (1876).
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Irregularity in proceedings.
          </b>
          - As the title of the State does not depend upon the inquest, it cannot be affected by any errors or irregularities in the proceedings of the escheator. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291 (1876).
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Entry by State when land held by adverse possession.
          </b>
          - If the possession of land be vacant at the death of the owner, both title and possession are at once transferred to the State; but if the land be held by adverse possession, the State must enter by her officers. Such an entry, however, is not essential to the State's title. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291 (1876).
          <br/>
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           When title of State not divested.
          </b>
          - Upon the death of the owner of lands, intestate, without heirs capable of inheriting, the title, eo instanti and before office found, vests in the State; and the title cannot be divested by a sale made under the decree of any court, unless the State in some form is a party to the proceeding. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291 (1876).

        If any debt of a person who died in possession of such lands that escheated to the Commonwealth, remains unpaid after all the personal estate of such person has been applied to the payment of his debts, the creditor may file his complaint, accompanied with an affidavit that the debt is bona fide due, to recover such debt in the circuit court to which the inquest of escheat was returned and make the escheator defendant. If the court orders that the debt or any part thereof is due, the amount ordered to be due shall be paid by the escheator, if the escheator has enough of the proceeds of sale remaining to cover the amount, or out of the state treasury, if enough of the proceeds that have been paid into the state treasury still remain in the state treasury, or to the credit of the Literary Fund.

       If the owner of drift property described in § 55.1-2700 does not, within three months from the time the property was so deposited, remove or demand the property from the owner of the land, the owner of the land may sell the property or otherwise convert it to his own use, provided that the owner of the land, after deducting a just compensation for any proper care, labor, or expense bestowed, done, or incurred by him for the property from the amount received by him as the price thereof, or the actual value thereof at the time of such sale or other conversion, shall pay to the owner of the property, if he elects to receive it, the residue of the price or of the actual value, as the case may be. The owner of the property, after he has demanded such residue and proved by the affidavit of some other person, or by a competent witness, his right thereto, or offered to prove such right, and if the owner of the land has refused or declined to inspect or hear the evidence thereof, (i) may recover such residue, when the property has been sold, as money received for his use; (ii) may recover such residue, when the property has not been sold, as the price of goods sold by the owner of the property to the owner of the land; or (iii) may have his action of trover to the extent of such residue.

         In an action to recover damages for injuries sustained when plaintiff was hit by a heifer which had escaped from defendant's stockyard in a city by jumping a fence five feet three inches high and had run wild through the area where plaintiff was at work, it was no defense that defendant's fences were five feet high and therefore lawful fences under this section. This section has no application in cities, and furthermore, the degree of care is to be measured by the particular situation. Perlin v.

    - The classification scheme in this section, discriminatory though it may be, is not unreasonable or arbitrary simply because it favors owners of land used for agricultural purposes over owners of industrial, commercial, or subdivided property.
    Without question, the opt-out provision applies to all persons who are similarly situated and applies to all parts of the Commonwealth where like conditions exist. To that extent the provisions are general. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, <cite class="va_code">241 Va. 425</cite>, 404 S.E.2d 48 (1991).

     Legislative intent.
    </b>
    - The 1970 General Assembly in amending this section, unlike the 1887 General Assembly, was faced with continued urbanization in the land use of the Commonwealth evidenced by proliferation of residential subdivisions, commercial shopping centers, and industrial complexes and was also confronted with the division fence law which permitted owners of commercial, industrial, and subdivided property whose lands abutted agricultural property to allow their land to lie open without being fenced.
    With this collision of interests between rural and urban Virginia, the mutual benefit, convenience, and welfare of all the Commonwealth's citizens demanded that conditions such as the probability of livestock roaming through residential neighborhoods, commercial shopping centers, industrial parks, and associated streets, be avoided. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, <cite class="va_code">241 Va. 425</cite>, 404 S.E.2d 48 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         The legislature decided that agricultural owners should have primary control over establishment of division fences and that the cost of erecting a division fence between agricultural land and commercial, industrial, and subdivided land should be shared equally, and not be borne solely by the agricultural owner. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, <cite class="va_code">241 Va. 425</cite>, 404 S.E.2d 48 (1991).

        - Landowner was responsible for the entire cost of replacing a worn out and deteriorating division fence, including the clean-up after the construction, because the owner's evidence was not as believable and her arguments not as persuasive as that of the neighbor regarding the cause of the damage to the fence, the neighbor was not statutorily obligated to share the cost of the fence where he chose to let his land lie open, and he had no liability for half of the cost of rebuilding/repairing the fence where the owner did not give the statutorily required notice.

      <p>
       If no division fence has been built, either one of the adjoining landowners may give notice in writing of his desire and intention to build such fence to the landowner of the adjoining land, or to his agent, and require him to build his half of such fence. The landowner so notified may, within 10 days after receiving such notice, give notice in writing to the person so desiring to build such fence, or to his agent, of his intention to let his land lie open. If the landowner giving the original notice subsequently builds such division fence and the landowner who has so chosen to let his land lie open, or his successors in title, subsequently encloses his land, he, or his successors, shall be liable to the landowner who built such fence, or to his successors in title, for one-half of the value of such fence at the time such land was so enclosed, and such fence shall thereafter be deemed a division fence between such lands.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, the person so notified fails to give notice of his intention to let his land lie open, and fails to agree, within 30 days after being so notified, to build his half of such fence, he shall be liable to the person who builds the fence for one-half of the expense, and such fence shall thereafter be deemed a division fence between such lands.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no successor in title shall be liable for any amount prior to the recordation and proper recordation of the notice in the clerk's office of the county in which the land is located.

If the landowner receiving written notice fails to repair his half within 30 days after being so notified, the one giving such notice may then repair the entire fence so as to make it a lawful fence, and the other shall be liable to him for one-half of the expense of such repairs.

For the purposes of determining damages, the value of the timber cut shall be calculated by first determining the value of the timber on the stump. Within 30 days after receiving notice of the alleged trespass and of the appointment of such estimator, the alleged trespasser, if he does not deny the fact of trespass, shall appoint an experienced timber estimator to participate with the one already so appointed in the estimation of damages. If the two estimators cannot agree, they shall select a third person, experienced and disinterested, who shall make a decision that shall be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal.

    - Since defendant did not contend that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that he knowingly and willfully stole timber from the victim, he conceded the evidence was sufficient to support the statutory elements of larceny, and because there was insufficient evidence to show that the timber was worth $200 or more, the larceny was petit larceny under

        - Where the plats on record clearly established the mutual boundary line between the parties' properties, and following an old fence line was neither prudent nor a bona fide claim of right, the landowners were entitled to treble damages, filing costs, appraiser's fees, the stumpage value of the timber, and damages for the diminution of value to their property by the trespassers' unauthorized acts of cutting timber from their property.

         - Parties could enter into exculpatory agreements and no exception at law precluded a private self-storage facility, such as the corporation, from limiting its risk as to its customers - moreover, the court was unwilling to create such an exception under the circumstances of the case - accordingly, the corporation's liability was limited pursuant to the exculpatory provisions contained in the rental agreement. There was no basis to conclude that the corporation possessed an unfair bargaining position over the renter, nor that the exculpatory clause contained in the rental agreement violated public policy; the release, interpreted based on its plain and unambiguous language, could be readily understood by a reasonable person in the renter's position; and finally, the renter's asserted claim was clearly within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.
