       Transition provisions.

     </p>
     <p>
      At its regular session of 1968 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to revise certain titles of the Code, including Title 40, relating to labor and employment. In August of 1969 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision of Title 40, which was published as House Document 4 of the 1970 session. This report contains revisor's notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission's draft of the revision of Title 40, as amended by the General Assembly, became chapter 321 of the Acts of 1970. It repeals Title 40 of the Code and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 40.1. As required by
      <span class="s1">
       §
      </span>
      30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated in Title 40.1 the amendments to Title 40 enacted at the 1970 session of the General Assembly.
     </p>

      Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law.

      Acts 1970, c. 321, cls. 2-5, provide as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "2. All acts and parts of acts, all sections of the Code of Virginia, and all provisions of municipal charters inconsistent with the provisions of this act are, except as otherwise provided, repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
     </p>
     <p>
      "3. The repeal of Title 40 effective October 1, 1970, shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued or accruing on or before such date, or any prosecution, suit or action pending on that date. Except as in this act otherwise provided, neither the repeal of Title 40 nor the enactment of Title 40.1 shall apply to offenses committed prior to October 1, 1970, and prosecutions for such offenses shall be governed by the prior law, which is continued in effect for that purpose. For the purposes of this act, an offense was committed prior to October 1, 1969, if any of the essential elements of the offense occurred prior thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      "4. Whenever in Title 40.1 any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 40 as such title existed prior to October 1, 1970, are transferred in the same or in modified form to a new section, article or chapter of Title 40.1 and whenever any such former section, article or chapter of Title 40 is given a new number in Title 40.1, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 40 appearing in the Code of Virginia shall be construed to apply to the new and renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions or contents or portions thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      "5. It is the intention of the General Assembly that this act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes set out herein, and if any clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this act shall ever be declared unconstitutional, it shall be deemed severable, and the remainder of this act shall continue in full force and effect."

       Federal preemption.

      - Federal law governing the employment of unauthorized aliens explicitly and implicitly preempts any Virginia law that would impose civil or criminal sanctions upon persons employing such aliens. Further, imposition of an injunction constitutes a civil sanction, which is preempted by federal law.

      - Federal and state laws prohibit a commissioner of the revenue from issuing a local business license to an applicant not legally present in the United States. Further, a commissioner must verify the identity and eligibility of all applicants by examining documents specified by federal law. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Calvin C. Massie, Jr., Commissioner of the Revenue, Campbell County, 06-049, 2006 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (7/24/06) (Overruled by 2020 Va. AG LEXIS 28).

       The Safety and Health Codes Commission is continued and shall hereafter be known as the Safety and Health Codes Board. The Board shall consist of fourteen members, twelve of whom shall be appointed by the Governor. One member shall, by reason of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, be chosen to represent labor in the manufacturing industry; one member shall, by reason of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, be chosen to represent labor in the construction industry; one member shall, by reason of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, be chosen to represent industrial employers; one member shall be chosen from and be a representative of the general public; one member shall be a representative of agricultural employers; one member shall, by reason of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, be chosen to represent agricultural employees; one member shall, by reason of previous vocation, employment or affiliation, be chosen to represent construction industry employers; one member shall be a representative of an insurance company; one member shall be a labor representative from the boiler pressure vessel industry; one member shall be a labor representative knowledgeable in chemicals and toxic substances; one member shall be an employer representative of the boiler pressure vessel industry; one member shall be an industrial representative knowledgeable in chemical and toxic substances, and the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality or his duly authorized representative shall be a member ex officio with full membership status.

       The Board, with the advice of the Commissioner, is hereby authorized to adopt, alter, amend, or repeal rules and regulations to further, protect and promote the safety and health of employees in places of employment over which it has jurisdiction and to effect compliance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-596), and as may be necessary to carry out its functions established under this title. The Commissioner shall enforce such rules and regulations. All such rules and regulations shall be designed to protect and promote the safety and health of such employees. In making such rules and regulations to protect the occupational safety and health of employees, the Board shall adopt the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity. However, such standards shall be at least as stringent as the standards promulgated by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-596). In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired. Such standards when applicable to products which are distributed in interstate commerce shall be the same as federal standards unless deviations are required by compelling local conditions and do not unduly burden interstate commerce.

The publication mentioned herein shall constitute notice that the Board intends to adopt such standard within a period of six months. The Board by similar publication shall prior to the expiration of six months give notice of the time and date of, and conduct a hearing on, the adoption of a permanent standard. The emergency temporary standard shall expire within six months or when superseded by a permanent standard, whichever occurs first, or when repealed by the Board.

Adoption of a federal occupational safety and health standard shall be deemed to be sufficient evidence to support promulgation of such standard. The filing of a petition for declaratory judgment shall not operate as a stay of the standard unless the court issues a preliminary injunction.

      It shall be an unfair employment practice for an employer who has established an employment policy of discharging employees who are absent from work for a specified number of days to include in the computation of an employee's work absence record any day that such employee is absent from work due to a compensable absence under Title 65.2; provided, that such compensable absences can be calculated into an employee's work record for purposes of discharge after all steps of the excessive absenteeism policy have been exhausted.
      An employer shall not be held in violation of this section if the employee's absence exceeds six months or if the employer's circumstances have changed during such employee's absence so as to make it impossible or unreasonable not to discharge such employee.

      Any employer who violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $100 for each violation. The Commissioner shall notify any employer who he alleges has violated any provision of this section by certified mail or overnight delivery service. Such notice shall contain a description of the alleged violation. Within 21 days of receipt of notice of the alleged violation, the employer may request an informal conference regarding such violation with the Commissioner. If the employer fails to contest the violation by requesting such an informal conference within 21 days following its receipt of the notice of the alleged violation, the violation and proposed penalty will become a final order of the Commissioner and not subject to review by any court or agency except upon a showing of good cause. Such informal conference shall result in a decision by the Commissioner that will be appealable to the appropriate circuit court. The Department shall send a copy of the Commissioner's decision to the employer by certified mail or overnight delivery service. The employer may file a notice of an appeal only within 30 days from the receipt of the decision. The appeal shall be on the agency record. With respect to matters of law, the burden shall be on the party seeking review to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court. With respect to issues of fact, the duty of the court shall be limited to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the record to reasonably support the Commissioner's findings of fact.

     <p>
      No employer having employees shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of administration and enforcement, any amounts owing to any employee which have been withheld in violation of this section shall be deemed to be unpaid wages or unpaid overtime compensation and the employee whose wages have been wrongfully withheld in violation of this section shall have a right of action therefor to recover damages to the extent of two times the amount of wages so withheld.

       In determining the wage of a tipped employee, the amount paid such employee by his employer shall be deemed to be increased on account of tips by an amount determined by the employer, except in the case of an employee who establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the actual amount of tips received by him was less than the amount determined by the employer. In such case, the amount paid such employee by his employer shall be deemed to have been increased by such lesser amount. An employer shall not classify an individual as a tipped employee if the individual is prohibited by applicable federal or state law or regulation from soliciting tips.

       - Prior to the 1977 amendment to this section, which inserted "willfully and with intent to defraud" in former subsection (d), this section on its face dealt with a naked civil debt and there was no indication that the General Assembly implicitly meant to include proof of an intent to defraud as an essential element of the offense.

       The standard for establishing an employer's constructive knowledge of a workplace hazard was met where the company's operations manager and vice president and the company's president had primary responsibility for inspecting the site and regularly did so, where the safety hazard posed by uncovered or incompletely covered holes in the roof at the site was open and obvious, and where the company officials were informed about the absence of full coverings for the holes and the safety hazard they posed.

       Circuit court did not err in finding that the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry met his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a county department of public works and environmental services had actual or constructive knowledge of safety violations because the record contained ample evidence from which one could conclude that the department should have known that its measures to prevent employees from entering permit-required confined spaces in violation of its policies were ineffective and that permit-required confined spaces on private land were not being evaluated; the circuit court correctly found substantial evidence that the department should have known about the deficiencies in its program and provided training to remedy those issues.

       - As a compliance officer who issued a citation to a county department of public works
       for failure to review confined-space permits testified that he did not know whether a department of public works employee reviewed the permits, a hearing officer for the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry improperly sustained the citation.

       Upon entering a manhole, an employee for a county department of public works fell down a shaft and sustained fatal injuries. Substantial evidence supported the finding of a hearing officer for the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry that that the wet pond facility the employee entered was a permit-required confined space; the department of public works did not specify acceptable entry conditions as to the space; the space was not protected by proper barriers; the department of public works did not verify that conditions were safe for entry; it did not monitor the space, or provide necessary communications, rescue, and emergency equipment; it failed to develop procedures for summoning rescue services; and it failed to provide an attendant outside the permit space.

        No duty to immediately file complaint.
       </b>
       - The plain meaning of subsection E dictates that the only immediate action required of the Commissioner upon receiving notice of a contest of a citation
       is to notify the Commonwealth's attorney, and the duty to take immediate action does not extend to the filing of a complaint; the word "immediately" only modifies the phrase "shall notify the attorney for the Commonwealth" and the General Assembly did not repeat the word "immediately" in the second portion of the sentence when referring to the filing of a bill of complaint.

       In a case involving workplace safety violations, an employer was unable to show that a 34-month delay in filing an enforcement action was unreasonable because there was no actual prejudice; the employer conducted a complete investigation after citations were issued, and the passage of time did not contribute to the destruction of records or the inability to locate a key employee.

       Bill of complaint filed by the Commissioner of the Department of Labor was dismissed because, while the 25-month delay in filing notice of a company's contest with the Commonwealth's Attorney was not inherently prejudicial, the company presented credible evidence that it had been actually prejudiced by the length of the interval between the notice of contest and the filing of the bill of complaint and the limited explanation offered by Commissioner's counsel was unreasonable.

       § 40.1-49.9. Issuance of warrant.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Administrative search warrants for inspections of workplaces, based upon a petition demonstrating probable cause and supported by an affidavit, may be issued by any judge having authority to issue criminal warrants whose territorial jurisdiction encompasses the workplace to be inspected or entered, if he is satisfied from the petition and affidavit that there is reasonable and probable cause for the issuance of an administrative search warrant. No administrative search warrant shall be issued pursuant to this chapter except upon probable cause, supported by affidavit, particularly describing the place, things or persons to be inspected or tested and the purpose for which the inspection, testing or collection of samples for testing is to be made. Probable cause shall be deemed to exist if either (i) reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting such inspection, testing or collection of samples for testing are satisfied with respect to the particular place, thing, or person, or (ii) there is cause to believe that there is a condition, object, activity, or circumstance which legally justifies such inspection, testing or collection of samples for testing. The supporting affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect, test or collect samples for testing has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to seek such consent in order to enforce effectively the occupational safety and health laws, regulations or standards of the Commonwealth which authorize such inspection, testing or collection of samples for testing. In the case of an administrative search warrant based on legislative or administrative standards for selecting workplaces for inspection, the affidavit shall contain factual allegations sufficient to justify an independent determination by the judge that the inspection program is based on reasonable standards and that the standards are being applied to a particular workplace in a neutral and fair manner. For example, if a selection is based on a particular industry's high hazard ranking, the affidavit shall disclose the method used to establish that ranking, the numerical basis for that ranking, and the relevant inspection history of the workplace to be inspected and the status of all other workplaces within the same territorial region which are subject to inspection pursuant to the legislative or administrative standards used by the Commissioner. The affidavit shall not be required to disclose the actual schedule for inspections or the underlying data on which the statistics were based, provided that such statistics are derived from reliable, neutral third parties. The issuing judge may examine the affiant under oath or affirmation to verify the accuracy of any matter in the affidavit. After issuing a warrant under this section, the judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § 19.2-54.

        Contractor's liability for subcontractors.

       - Although the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Program contended a general contractor in control of a worksite should be held liable under tort principles for a subcontractor's Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Act violations, not a word of it can be found in the act or any "rules and regulations" promulgated under this section; none of these promulgated "rules and regulations" addressed the liability interplay between general and subcontractors, much less the imputation of a subcontractor's statutory defaults to a general contractor under a tort-based reasonable care standard.

        Picketing is subject to regulation by State.
       </b>
       - The pattern which emerges to shape the boundaries of state action seems to be that picketing is subject to regulation by the State, either by legislation or by court action. But such regulation must have a reasonable basis in prevention of disorder, restraint of coercion, protection of life or property, or promotion of the general welfare. The instrument of state action, whether judicial process or legislative enactment, must be specifically directed to acts or conduct which overstep legal limits, and not include those which keep within the protected area of free speech.

       - There is nothing in this section which supports the assertion that it was designed to end the practice, common to labor disputes, known as picketing. It does not prohibit peaceful picketing or peaceful persuasion in connection with labor disputes which are protected under the constitutional guaranty of freedom of speech. McWhorter v. Commonwealth,

       - The prohibition in this section against the interference with the right to work by the use of force, threats, violence, intimidation, or insulting words, acts which are inherently wrong and liable to bring about an immediate breach of the peace, is within the police power of the State and does not trespass upon the constitutional right of freedom of speech.

       The right or privilege of free speech has its limitations, and it is not violated by a state statute which makes it a crime to address any offensive, derisive, or annoying word to any person lawfully in a public place, or to call him by an offensive or derisive name, which has a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom individually the remark is addressed.

        Section does not prohibit insulting words or language.
       </b>
       - This section does not prohibit or punish the use of offensive words by one picket toward another picket, or toward one not connected with the particular industrial plant concerned in a labor dispute. Nor does it confine those on the picket line to language suitable only to the drawing room or the parlor car. McWhorter v. Commonwealth,

       - This section is not aimed at merely insulting language. The statute's focus is on language which the user intends to be, or is in and of itself, intimidating or coercive. Proscribed is the use of words through which the speaker intends to convey a threat of impending harm. United Steelworkers v. Dalton, 544 F. Supp. 282 (E.D. Va. 1982).

        "Insulting or threatening language" construed.
       </b>
       - The words "insulting or threatening language" cannot be read in a vacuum. They must be read in the context of the sentence of which they are a part. These words are preceded by the words "by the use of force, threats of violence or intimidation." Such words precedent color the meaning of the words that follow. Read as a whole, the language of the statute prohibits the use of language violent in nature; language which can be construed as expressing an actual intention of inflicting injury.

     <p>
      Whenever there is in effect a collective bargaining contract covering employees of any utility engaged in the business of furnishing water, light, heat, gas, electric power, transportation or communication, the utility or the collective bargaining agent recognized by the utility and its employees shall not terminate or modify such contract until the party desiring such termination or modification serves written notice upon the Department of the proposed termination or modification at least thirty days prior to the expiration date thereof or, in the event such contract contains no expiration date, at least thirty days prior to the date it is proposed to make such termination or modification; provided, however, that a party having given notice of modification as provided herein shall not be required to give a notice of termination of the same contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there is no collective bargaining contract in effect, the utility or its employees shall give at least thirty days' notice to the Department prior to any work stoppage which would affect the operations of the utility engaged in the business of furnishing any of the utilities as described in this section.

     <p>
      If the utility or its employees, or the collective bargaining agent recognized by the utility and its employees, as the case may be, fails to give thirty days' notice as required by this section, the utility or its employees or such collective bargaining agent, as the case may be, may file a bill of complaint with the clerk of the circuit court having equity jurisdiction over the place of employment asking the court to temporarily enjoin such termination, modification or work stoppage until the proper notice has been served and the thirty-day period has been observed. The court shall have the authority to impose against any person who violates the notice provisions of this section a fine of up to $100 for each day such termination, modification or work stoppage continues until proper notice has been served and observed or against the collective bargaining agent the court shall have the authority to impose a fine of up to $1,000 for each day such termination or modification continues until proper notice has been served and observed.

        Relative duty of proprietor and parent to prevent employment.

       - This section provides that no child under 14 years of age shall be employed, "permitted or suffered to work," etc. These words do not impose upon the proprietor of a business the duty to prevent, or use reasonable care to prevent, the child from engaging in the business. The section only prohibits the employment of the child and the phrase "permitted or suffered to work" was intended to make the parent or other person in control, acquiescing in the employment, equally guilty with the proprietor of the business.

        §
       </span>
       1809 of the Code of 1919 (similar to this section) the employment of a child by a factory owner to work in his factory, with knowledge of the fact that he was within the prohibited age, was to be regarded per se as the proximate cause of an injury received by the child in the course of his employment. And where a child was knowingly employed contrary to the provisions of the statute and was injured in such employment, the employer was guilty of actionable negligence as a matter of law. The unlawful hiring constitutes the causal connection between the violation of the statute and the injury. Standard Red Cedar Chest Co. v. Monroe,

        Defendant's servant permitting child to assist in the delivery of milk.

       - A servant permitted a child to ride in defendant's milk wagon and assist him in the delivery of milk, and gave him presents. While thus assisting defendant's servant the child was run over and killed. Defendant had in force a rule prohibiting its drivers, who had neither authority nor necessity for employing assistants, from allowing boys to ride on its wagons or assist in the delivery of milk. This rule was enforced by defendant. Defendant had no knowledge that the driver had violated the rule by permitting the child to ride on the wagon or assist in the delivery of the milk. It was held that the act of the driver in securing the child to assist him was beyond the scope of his authority and defendant not having ratified such employment was not bound by the act of his servant, and the defendant having no knowledge of the driver's act, could not be said to have "permitted or suffered" the child to work in his service.

       - Under former wording of this section, it was held that the employment of a boy over 14 and under 16 years of age without having procured the required certificate was a tort, and an injury to the child occurring in the performance of duties under such employment was to be referred to the unlawful employment as the proximate cause of such injury. In such case it was also held that the doctrine of contributory negligence was applicable in an action for such injury. Miller Mfg. Co. v. Loving,

The myriad factors to be considered in such cases, such as the ages of the children, the length of the exposure, the level of supervision or lack thereof, and the quantity and variety of the drugs, suggested that as with most cases where criminal negligence was at issue, that determination was necessarily fact-specific; such determination was best left to the jury, which was in the best position to assess the weight and credibility of the evidence, and in that respect, and considering the totality of the evidence, the court could not say that the jury's finding of criminal negligence was plainly wrong or without support in the record.

Defendant previously said she "hated" the child, who was learning disabled; on at least one occasion while changing his diaper, she "plucked" his penis, making him cry, and "smacked him in the head" on another; on a third occasion, she used her foot to pick him up by his shirt and "slam him down on his butt"; and on a fourth occasion, she beat him with a wooden spoon for about twenty minutes as he lay in a fetal position, crying, on the kitchen floor. Although these prior incidents did not constitute direct evidence that defendant was responsible for child's extensive bruises at a later date, they were relevant to establish defendant's feelings toward child, and her intent in that she knew her actions were unlawful and likely to produce injury and she engaged in them anyway.
