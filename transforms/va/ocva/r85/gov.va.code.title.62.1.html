        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its regular session of 1966 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to revise certain titles of the Code, including Title 62, relating to waters of the State, ports and harbors. In December of 1967, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly a report containing the proposed revision of Title 62, which was published as House Document 9 of the 1968 session. This report contained revisor's notes and other explanatory matter. The Commission's draft of the revision of Title 62, as amended by the General Assembly, became chapter 659 of the Acts of 1968. Effective Oct. 1, 1968, it repealed Title 62 of the Code and enacted a new Title 62.1. Pursuant to
       §
       30-152, the Code Commission incorporated in Title 62.1 the amendments to Title 62 enacted at the 1968 session of the General Assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsequently, Acts 1992, c. 836, which revised and recodified the tidal fishing and habitat laws of Virginia, by inter alia, adding a Title 28.2 and repealing Title 28.1, repealed
       §§
       62.1-1 through 62.1-4, 62.1-9.1, 62.1-13.1 through 62.1-13.20, 62.1-13.21 through 62.1-13.28, and 62.1-194.1:1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 62.

       Where a watercourse is navigable, or by law declared a public highway, no court shall grant leave to any person to erect in that part of it any dam which will obstruct ordinary navigation or the passage of fish; and where any law has been or shall be enacted for opening, improving or extending the navigation of a watercourse no court shall, while such law is in force, grant leave to any person to erect any dam or other obstruction across or in such watercourse which will in any way interfere with the navigation thereof without express authority of law or the consent of the company incorporated to open, improve or extend such navigation. Any such dam shall, notwithstanding it may be built under such leave, be deemed a nuisance, and may be abated as such, or such company or the Commonwealth may make a lock or locks in such dam for the passage of vessels and boats without being required to make any compensation therefor.

      <p>
       The short title of this chapter is the State Water Control Law. It is the policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the purpose of this law to: (1) protect existing high quality state waters and restore all other state waters to such condition of quality that any such waters will permit all reasonable public uses and will support the propagation and growth of all aquatic life, including game fish, which might reasonably be expected to inhabit them; (2) safeguard the clean waters of the Commonwealth from pollution; (3) prevent any increase in pollution; (4) reduce existing pollution; (5) promote and encourage the reclamation and reuse of wastewater in a manner protective of the environment and public health; and (6) promote water resource conservation, management and distribution, and encourage water consumption reduction in order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the present and future citizens of the Commonwealth.

     Error not to consider settlement.
    </b>
    - Trial court erred in upholding the state environmental quality department's decision to deny the corporation a substantial part of its request for reimbursement from the Petroleum Storage Tank Fund for payments it made in settling a suit brought against it for property damage arising out of its petroleum storage spill. The trial court should have, but did not, consider the settlement amount in determining the reasonable and necessary costs of the occurrence, as the reimbursement amount was neither limited to judgments nor the reduction in market value of the property damaged, especially since the goal of the laws regarding reimbursement was to protect the quality of state waters and prevent any increase in pollution. 7-Eleven, Inc. v.

        - The provisions of the Virginia Scenic Rivers Act do not apply to riparian landowners constructing dams, docks, or other structures that could impede water flow along tributaries of designated waterways unless those tributaries are included within the scope of the designation. The Scenic Rivers Act does not impose any restrictions on a riparian landowner's management of surface water on his land abutting a designated waterway, and accordingly that a riparian landowner may engage in grading, plowing, timbering, or otherwise develop his property in a manner that might impede the flow of surface water across his property into a designated scenic river.

         Jurisdiction.

        - Where it was found that Virginia law now regulated activities in wetlands beyond its federal mandate, it would have been perverse for the appellate court to conclude that the jurisdictional limits of the Virginia Wetlands Resources Act of 2000 depended upon the Clean Water Act; therefore, the state water board possessed jurisdiction over its civil enforcement action against developers who, without obtaining a permit from the state water board, began ditching and draining wetlands on a 43-acre property.

     Board's actions held not confiscatory.
    </b>
    - State Water Control Board's action requiring connection of privately owned utilities' sewer lines to lines of public utility, which would leave the utilities' collector lines in operation and have no effect on the rates charged to customers, where the cost of construction of the treatment facilities had long been recaptured, and where abandonment of treatment facilities would have no effect on the utilities' continuation in business, operating profit, or value as going concerns, although there was presently no economically feasible alternative use for the abandoned structures or the land on which they stood, did not render the Board's actions confiscatory.

     Orders based on unattainable special standard held arbitrary.
    </b>
    - Where the Board adopted a "Special Standard" (captioned "Objective for Nutrients") which it knew to be unattainable at any cost, treated it as a desirable goal but made no effort to enforce it for over nine years, then without notice of hearing directed privately owned utilities to cease their treatment activities because of their inability to comply with it, leaving the utilities the alternative of connecting to public utility, such orders were the quintessence of arbitrary governmental action, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.

       Any Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued for a surface water impoundment whose primary purpose is to provide cooling water to power generators shall include a lake level contingency plan to allow specific reductions in the flow required to be released when the water level above the dam drops below designated levels due to drought conditions. The plan shall take into account and minimize any adverse effects of any release reduction requirements on beneficial uses, as defined in § 62.1-10, within the impoundment, and on downstream users. The reduction in release amounts required by a lake level contingency plan shall not be implemented to the extent they result in an adverse impact to (i) the ability to meet water quality standards based upon permitted discharge amounts, (ii) the ability to provide adequate water supplies for consumptive purposes such as drinking water and fire protection, and (iii) fish and wildlife resources. In the event there is an imminent threat of such an adverse impact, the permit holder and the Department of Environmental Quality shall be notified. Upon such notification, the permit holder may increase release amounts as specified in the permit for up to forty-eight hours or until such time as the Department of Environmental Quality determines whether or not the increase in release amounts is necessary. This section shall not apply to any such facility that addresses releases and flow requirements during drought conditions in a Virginia Water Protection Permit.

      <p>
       G.
    The Board is authorized to promulgate regulations establishing a schedule of reduced permit fees for facilities that have established a record of compliance with the terms and requirements of their permits and shall establish criteria by regulation to provide for reductions in the annual fee amount assessed for facilities accepted into the Department's programs to recognize excellent environmental performance.

That it is the General Assembly's intent that the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) shall evaluate and implement measures to improve the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of its programs in ensuring the Commonwealth's air quality, water quality and land resources are protected and to ensure the maximum value from the funding provided for the Commonwealth's environmental programs. To assist DEQ in accomplishing such goals, a management efficiency peer review shall be conducted of the Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit programs and the air permit program implemented by the agency. The review shall evaluate (i) operational changes that would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, (ii) ways to reduce the costs of compliance, and (iii) the adequacy and appropriateness of staffing levels to meet state and federal requirements. The review shall be led by a consulting firm with expertise and previous experience in conducting similar reviews of state agencies and private firms and shall include a peer review team appointed by the Director of DEQ, consisting of individuals familiar with the permit program including, but not limited to, persons nominated by the Virginia Association of Counties, the Virginia Chemistry Council, the Virginia Manufacturers Association, the Virginia Municipal League, the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, and the Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies. All individuals serving on the peer review team shall have previous training and experience in preparing applications for permits issued under the Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit program or the air permitting program. The consulting firm shall be selected by agreement between the Director of DEQ and the peer review team members from the previously mentioned organizations and in accordance with the Virginia Procurement Act. The review shall be completed and a written report containing findings and recommendations for the implementation of any practices, procedures or other steps necessary to increase the efficiency of DEQ shall be forwarded to the members of the peer review team by September 15, 2006. The report shall include information, to the extent available, on whether or not the recommendations would change the level of environmental protection, the estimated savings to DEQ and the regulated community, and any barriers to implementation. The report and DEQ's responses and plans for implementation of such recommendations shall be forwarded to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources, the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on Finance by October 15, 2006.

       "5. That a review of DEQ's solid waste permitting and inspection programs shall be conducted in order to ensure that those programs provide maximum efficiency consistent with protection of the environment and public health. The review shall be conducted by DEQ with the active participation of persons qualified by training and experience in the management and operation of solid waste facilities, who shall be recommended by the Virginia Waste Industries Association, the Solid Waste Association of North America and the Southwest Virginia Solid Waste Management Association. The review shall be completed and a written report containing findings and recommendations for the implementation of any practices, procedures or other steps necessary to increase the efficiency of DEQ shall be forwarded to the members of the peer review team by September 15, 2006. The report shall include information, to the extent available, on whether or not the recommendations would change the level of environmental protection, the estimated savings to DEQ and the regulated community, and any barriers to implementation.

      <p>
       "a. Implement a streamlined permit application to be used for renewals of previously granted environmental permits where there has been no significant change in the permitted activity or applicable statutory or regulatory requirements during the previous permit term. Such streamlined permit renewal application shall be designed, to the extent not prohibited by federal law or regulation, to avoid the submission and duplication of information that has previously been submitted by the applicant and achieve maximum efficiency and economy for both the permittee and DEQ, and DEQ shall work with the peer review team to develop these applications with the goal of minimizing the amount of duplicate, costly work on the part of the permit renewal applicants and DEQ;
      </p>
      <p>
       "b. Expeditiously implement electronic permitting, filing and reporting procedures so as to improve access to information, reduce the costs of compliance, and reduce costs to DEQ;
      </p>
      <p>
       "c. Explore ways to reduce compliance costs to the permittee and reduce DEQ's oversight costs for ensuring compliance. The options to be explored shall include, but not be limited to, increased utilization of certified evaluations (i.e., by professional engineers) as a method of ensuring compliance while reducing the need for physical inspections; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "d. Encourage efficient and effective environmental performance by deeming a facility's demonstration of a proven environmental management system, such as ISO 14001, along with a commitment to pollution prevention, annual progress reporting, and a record of sustained compliance as meeting the criteria for acceptance into DEQ's programs for environmental excellence.

    - Pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §

As a result, the environmental group had standing to challenge the granting of the city's request for extension and modification of a permit that allowed for construction and operation of a county reservoir, as the extended permit allowed for limited construction activities that had the possibility of harming the wetlands, which the environmental group was trying to protect.(decided under former

Such compensation requirements shall be sufficient to achieve no net loss of existing wetland acreage and functions and may be met through (i) wetland creation or restoration, (ii) purchase or use of mitigation bank credits pursuant to § 62.1-44.15:23, (iii) contribution to the Wetland and Stream Replacement Fund established pursuant to § 62.1-44.15:23.1 to provide compensation for impacts to wetlands, streams, or other state waters that occur in areas where neither mitigation bank credits nor credits from a Board-approved fund that have met the success criteria are available at the time of permit application, or (iv) contribution to a Board-approved fund dedicated to achieving no net loss of wetland acreage and functions. The Board shall evaluate the appropriate compensatory mitigation option on a case-by-case basis with consideration for which option is practicable and ecologically and environmentally preferable, including, in terms of replacement of acreage and functions, which option offers the greatest likelihood of success and avoidance of temporal loss of acreage and function. This evaluation shall be consistent with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources (33 C.F.R. Part 332). When utilized in conjunction with creation, restoration, or mitigation bank credits, compensation may incorporate (a) preservation or restoration of upland buffers adjacent to wetlands or other state waters or (b) preservation of wetlands.

        When a Virginia Water Protection Permit is conditioned upon compensatory mitigation for adverse impacts to wetlands or streams, the applicant may be permitted to satisfy all or part of such mitigation requirements by the purchase or use of credits from any wetland or stream mitigation bank in the Commonwealth, or in Maryland on property wholly surrounded by and located in the Potomac River if the mitigation banking instrument provides that the Board shall have the right to enter and inspect the property and that the mitigation bank instrument and the contract for the purchase or use of such credits may be enforced in the courts of the Commonwealth, including any banks owned by the permit applicant, that has been approved and is operating in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation of mitigation banks as long as (i) the impacted site is located in the bank's primary or secondary service area as provided in subsection C or it meets all the conditions found in clauses (a) through (d) and either clause (e) or (f); (ii) the bank is ecologically preferable to practicable onsite and offsite individual mitigation options as defined by federal wetland regulations; and (iii) the banking instrument, if approved after July 1, 1996, has been approved by a process that included public review and comment. When the impacted site is not located in the bank's primary or secondary service area, the purchase or use of credits shall not be allowed unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department of Environmental Quality that (a) the impacts will occur as a result of a Virginia Department of Transportation linear project or as the result of a locality project for a locality whose jurisdiction encompasses multiple river watersheds; (b) there is no practical same river watershed mitigation alternative; (c) the impacts are less than one acre in a single and complete project within a subbasin; (d) there is no significant harm to water quality or fish and wildlife resources within the river watershed of the impacted site; and either (e) impacts within the Chesapeake Bay watershed are mitigated within the Chesapeake Bay watershed as close as possible to the impacted site or (f) impacts within subbasins 02080108, 02080208, and 03010205, as defined by the National Watershed Boundary Dataset, are mitigated in-kind within those subbasins, as close as possible to the impacted site.

        § 62.1-44.15:23.1. Wetland and Stream Replacement Fund established.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Wetland and Stream Replacement Fund, hereafter referred to as "the Fund." The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. All contributions to the Board pursuant to clause (iii) of subsection B of § 62.1-44.15:21 shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it. Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. The Fund shall be administered and utilized by the Department of Environmental Quality. The Fund may be used as an additional mechanism for compensatory mitigation for impacts to aquatic resources (i) that result from activities authorized under (a) Section 404 and 401 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), (b) the Virginia Water Protection Permit Regulation (9 VAC 25-210 et seq.), or (c) Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (33 U.S.C. § 403); (ii) that result from unauthorized activities in waters of the United States or state waters; and (iii) in other cases, as the appropriate regulatory agencies deem acceptable. Moneys in the Fund shall be used for the purpose of purchasing mitigation bank credits in compliance with the provisions of subsection B of § 62.1-44.15:23 as soon as practicable if qualifying credits are available. If such credits are not available within three years of the collection of moneys for a specific impact, then funds shall be utilized either (1) to purchase credits from a Board-approved fund that have met the success criteria, if qualifying credits are available, (2) for the planning, construction, monitoring, and preservation of wetland and stream mitigation projects and preservation, enhancement, or restoration of upland buffers adjacent to wetlands or other state waters when used in conjunction with creation or restoration of wetlands and streams, or (3) for other water quality improvement projects as deemed acceptable by the Department of Environmental Quality. Such projects developed under clause (2) shall be developed in accordance with guidelines, responsibilities, and standards established by the Department of Environmental Quality for use, operation, and maintenance consistent with 33 CFR Part 332, governing compensatory mitigation for activities authorized by U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality. The Department may charge a reasonable fee to administer the Fund.

       This subdivision applies only to areas where there has been a documented prior use of nutrient credits to meet nutrient control requirements in an MS4 service area that flows to or is upstream of a water body segment for which a nutrient-related TMDL is being developed. For a TMDL waste load allocation applicable to the MS4, the Board shall develop the TMDL waste load allocation with the nutrient reduction benefits represented by the nutrient credit use being attributed to the MS4, except when the Board determines during the TMDL development process that reasonable assurance of implementation cannot be provided for nonpoint source load allocations due to the nutrient reduction benefits being attributed in this manner. The Board shall have no obligation to account for nutrient reduction benefits in this manner if the MS4 does not provide the Board with adequate documentation of (i) the location of the land-disturbing activities, (ii) the number of nutrient credits, and (iii) the generation of the nutrient credits upstream of the site at which the land-disturbing activity discharges to the water body segment addressed by the TMDL. Such attribution shall not be interpreted as amending the requirement that the TMDL be established at a level necessary to meet the applicable water quality standard.

        The Department is authorized to conduct inspections of the land-disturbing activities of interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline companies that have approved annual standards and specifications pursuant to § 62.1-44.15:31 as such land-disturbing activities relate to construction of any natural gas transmission pipeline equal to or greater than 24 inches inside diameter to determine (i) compliance with such annual standards and specifications, (ii) compliance with any site-specific plans, and (iii) if there have been or are likely to be adverse impacts to water quality as a result of such land-disturbing activities, including instances where (a) there has been a violation of any water quality standard adopted pursuant to the State Water Control Law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.), (b) sediment has been deposited in significant amounts in areas where those deposits are not contained by best management practices, (c) there are repeated instances of adverse impacts or likely adverse impacts within a 30-day period, or (d) there have been widespread and repeated instances of adverse impacts or likely impacts. When the Department determines that there has been a substantial adverse impact to water quality or that an imminent and substantial adverse impact to water quality is likely to occur as a result of such land-disturbing activities, the Department may issue a stop work instruction, without advance notice or hearing, requiring that all or part of such land-disturbing activities on the part of the site that caused the substantial adverse impacts to water quality or are likely to cause imminent and substantial adverse impacts to water quality be stopped until corrective measures specified in the stop work instruction have been completed and approved by the Department. Where substantial adverse impacts or likely adverse impacts are found on a repeated, frequent, and widespread basis, the Department may issue a stop work instruction for every work area in Virginia until the Department determines that any systemic cause that contributed to such occurrences has been corrected.

A VESCP may enter into an agreement with an adjacent VESCP regarding the administration of multijurisdictional projects whereby the jurisdiction that contains the greater portion of the project shall be responsible for all or part of the administrative procedures"; in subsection B, deleted "of competence" following "a certificate" four times; deleted subsections D and E, and renumbered subsequent subsections; and added subsection F.

    10.1-566 provides for two distinct orders that may be issued to compel compliance with permit and plan approval requirements: (1) an initial order that applies only to land disturbing activities, and (2) a more restrictive second order encompassing all construction activities that may be issued for noncompliance with the first order. Further, building official lacks the authority to limit the scope of the second order once it is issued. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James E.

However, any VESCP authority may waive the certificate requirement for an agreement in lieu of a plan for construction of a single-family detached residential structure. The owner shall be given notice of the inspection. When the VESCP authority or the Board determines that there is a failure to comply with the conditions of land-disturbance approval or to obtain an approved plan or a land-disturbance approval prior to commencing land-disturbing activity, the VESCP authority or the Board may serve a notice to comply upon the owner or person responsible for carrying out the land-disturbing activity. Such notice to comply shall be served by delivery by facsimile, e-mail, or other technology; by mailing with confirmation of delivery to the address specified in the plan or land-disturbance application, if available, or in the land records of the locality; or by delivery at the site to a person previously identified to the VESCP authority by the owner. The notice to comply shall specify the measures needed to comply with the land-disturbance approval conditions or shall identify the plan approval or land-disturbance approval needed to comply with this article and shall specify a reasonable time within which such measures shall be completed. In any instance in which a required land-disturbance approval has not been obtained, the VESCP authority or the Board may require immediate compliance. In any other case, the VESCP authority or the Board may establish the time for compliance by taking into account the risk of damage to natural resources and other relevant factors. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, a VESCP authority or the Board may count any days of noncompliance as days of violation should the VESCP authority or the Board take an enforcement action. The issuance of a notice to comply by the Board shall not be considered a case decision as defined in § 2.2-4001. Upon failure to comply within the time specified, any plan approval or land-disturbance approval may be revoked and the VESCP authority or the Board may pursue enforcement as provided by § 62.1-44.15:63.

       The General Assembly determines and finds that to comply with § 401 of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1341), any applicant for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity that may result in any discharge into navigable waters shall provide the federal licensing or permitting authority with a certification from the state in which the discharge originates or will originate certifying that any such discharge will comply with applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act. The General Assembly determines and finds that the Virginia Water Protection Permit program has proven to be sufficient to evaluate and, when necessary, mitigate potential water quality impacts for most federally permitted projects. Virginia Water Protection Permit coverage addresses the impacts caused to wetlands and streams by excavating in a wetland, draining or significantly altering wetland acreage or function, filling or dumping in a stream or wetland, or permanently flooding or impounding a wetland area or stream. However, the conditions and requirements of a Virginia Water Protection Permit do not cover activities in upland areas, outside of wetlands and streams, that may result in a discharge to state waters. The General Assembly determines and finds that for construction of natural gas transmission pipelines greater than 36 inches inside diameter that are subject to a certificate of public convenience and necessity under § 7c of the federal Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. § 717f(c)), there may be activities in upland areas that may have the potential to affect water quality but that do not fall within the scope of the Virginia Water Protection Permit program. Information related to such impacts would not be contained in the Joint Permit Application utilized to determine permit conditions for a Virginia Water Protection Permit. The General Assembly determines and finds that issuance of a Virginia Water Protection Permit and a certification issued pursuant to this article shall together constitute the certification required under § 401 of the Clean Water Act for natural gas transmission pipelines greater than 36 inches inside diameter subject to § 7c of the Natural Gas Act.

        - Term "applied" in the statute is ambiguous, and the term "where waste shall not be applied" means the intentional application of manure into fields or other usage areas; the statute does not require a mandatory livestock stream exclusion, but rather specifically enumerates the actions the State Water Control Board must take to alleviate environmental damage from confined animal feeding operations, and a plain reading of the statute renders "applied" to mean the intentional application of manure and not the random defecation of livestock.

       The 2000 Chesapeake Bay Agreement and related multistate cooperative and regulatory initiatives (i) establish allocations for nitrogen and phosphorus delivered to the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries to meet applicable water quality standards and (ii) place caps on the loads of these nutrients that may be discharged into the Chesapeake Bay watershed. These initiatives will require public and private point source dischargers of nitrogen and phosphorus to achieve significant additional reductions of these nutrients to meet the cap load allocations. The General Assembly finds and determines that adoption and utilization of a watershed general permit and market-based point source nutrient credit trading program will assist in (a) meeting these cap load allocations cost-effectively and as soon as possible in keeping with the 2010 timeline and objectives of the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement, (b) accommodating continued growth and economic development in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and (c) providing a foundation for establishing market-based incentives to help achieve the Chesapeake Bay Program's nonpoint source reduction goals.

Since Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) was not an "owner" as defined by the basic law, EDF was without standing to challenge the denial of the petition for formal hearing.

     Standing requirements.
    </b>
    - The wording of this section tracks the language by the United States Supreme Court about standing requirements imposed by the "case" or "controversy" provisions of Article III of the United States Constitution. The standing doctrine requires (1) that the plaintiff has suffered an "injury in fact," an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, that is, the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of independent action of some third party not before the court; and (3) that it be likely, not merely speculative, the injury will be redressed by the court's favorable decision. Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">261 Va. 366</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 920, 2001 Va. LEXIS 26 (2001); State Water Control Bd. v.

        As riparian owners had sufficiently alleged damage to their recreational interests in their petition for review of actions of the State Water Control Board (SWCB), the trial court erred in ruling they lacked standing to contest the SWCB's issuance of a permit to allow the county to discharge pollutants into a river adjoining the owners' land.

III standing are not merely requirements of pleading, but must be supported by adequate evidence. State Water Control Bd. v.

Its allegations that the discharge of chemicals under the permit violated discharge restrictions set at the level necessary to protect the designated uses of the receiving waterways was a sufficient injury in fact to confer standing on the organization itself, as it used the river for educational, recreational, and restorative purposes.

        Court of Appeals of Virginia properly determined that an environmental conservation organization had standing to appeal the approval of a wastewater discharge permit affecting the James River issued by the State Water Control Board, reversing the judgment of the circuit court, as it presented sufficient allegations of an injury in fact, a link between the injury and the grant of a wastewater discharge permit, and an available civil remedy.

        Environmental group asserted in a petition to appeal a decision of the Commonwealth agency, the State Water Control Board, that extension of the city's permit to build and operate a county reservoir would impair natural river resources or impair the aesthetic value of rivers. Thus, its factual allegations sufficiently showed: (1) an injury in fact; (2) a causal connection; and (3) the injury could be redressed such that it had individual standing to seek judicial review of the decision under the State Water Control Law. It showed that that its individual members had standing to sue in their own rights, the interests involved were germane to its purpose, and that individual members did not have to be involved such that it showed it had representational standing.

        The State Water Control Board is empowered and directed to adopt all necessary regulations for the purpose of controlling the discharge of sewage and other wastes from both documented and undocumented boats and vessels on all navigable and nonnavigable waters within this Commonwealth. No such regulation shall impose restrictions that are more restrictive than the regulations applicable under federal law; provided, however, the Board may adopt such regulations as are reasonably necessary with respect to: (i) vessels regularly berthed in marinas or other places where vessels are moored, in order to limit or avoid the closing of shellfish grounds; and (ii) no discharge zones. Documented and undocumented boats and vessels are prohibited from discharging into the Chesapeake Bay and the tidal portions of its tributaries sewage that has not been treated by a Coast Guard-approved Marine Sanitation Device (MSD Type 1 or Type 2); however, the discharge of treated or untreated sewage by such boats and vessels is prohibited in areas that have been designated as no discharge zones by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Any discharges, as defined in 9VAC25-71-10, that are incidental to the normal operation of a vessel shall not constitute a violation of this section.

        The tidal creeks of the Commonwealth are hereby established as no discharge zones for the discharge of sewage and other wastes from documented and undocumented boats and vessels. Criteria for the establishment of no discharge zones shall be premised on the improvement of impaired tidal creeks. Nothing in this section shall be construed to discourage the proper use of Type 1 and Type 2 Marine Sanitation Devices, as defined under 33 U.S.C. § 1332, in authorized areas other than properly designated no discharge zones. The Board shall adopt regulations for designated no discharge zones requiring (i) boats and vessels without installed toilets to dispose of any collected sewage from portable toilets or other containment devices at marina facilities approved by the Department of Health for collection of sewage wastes, or otherwise dispose of sewage in a manner that complies with state law; (ii) all boats and vessels with installed toilets to have a marine sanitation device to allow sewage holding capacity unless the toilets are rendered inoperable; (iii) all houseboats having installed toilets to have a holding tank with the capability of collecting and holding sewage and disposing of collected sewage at a pump-out facility; if the houseboats lack such tank then the marine sanitation device shall comply with clause (iv); (iv) y-valves, macerator pump valves, discharge conveyances or any other through-hull fitting valves capable of allowing a discharge of sewage from marine sanitation devices shall be secured in the closed position while in a no discharge zone by use of a padlock, nonreleasable wire tie, or removal of the y-valve handle. The method chosen shall present a physical barrier to the use of the y-valve or toilet; and (v) every owner or operator of a marina within a designated no discharge zone to notify boat patrons leasing slips of the sewage discharge restriction in the no discharge zone. As a minimum, notification shall consist of no discharge zone information in the slip rental contract and a sign indicating the area is a designated no discharge zone.

The trial court should have, but did not, consider the settlement amount in determining the reasonable and necessary costs of the occurrence, as the reimbursement amount was neither limited to judgments nor the reduction in market value of the property damaged. 7-Eleven, Inc. v.

        - Liability imposed by
        §
        62.1-44.34:14 et seq. extends to oil discharges occurring on all lands located within the Commonwealth of Virginia and this is supported by fact that statute's purpose is to provide the Commonwealth of Virginia or any political subdivision thereof or any person with a remedy when a discharge of oil causes harm to human health or welfare, harm to the environment, or damage to personal or real property, and this statutory purpose includes providing private individuals with a cause of action for damage to their real or personal property.

       <p>
        <b>
         "Injury to property."
        </b>
        - The Virginia Supreme Court would not construe "injury to property" to include mere economic losses caused by the diminution in value of property as landowners urge in the instant case. Adams v. Star Enter., 51 F.3d 417 (4th Cir. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Need for physical impact.
        </b>
        - Generally accepted principles of tort law do not recognize claims for damages for negligent conduct in circumstances such as those alleged by landowners in the absence of an actual physical impact on the property. If the Virginia legislature had wished not only to extend liability for oil spills to reasonable conduct, but also to expand that liability beyond common-law boundaries and extend it to all property owners whose property values were adversely affected by an oil spill, it certainly would have done so in far more express terms. Adams v. Star Enter., 51 F.3d 417 (4th Cir. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Defendant's motion to dismiss claim denied.
        </b>
        - Because this section applied to oil discharges on private lands in Virginia, and because owners of farm had made allegations, which consisted of negligence on defendant's part in failing to cap, seal or close oil supply lines which had been disconnected in course of installing furnace, and thus causing oil to spill onto floor of residence, this was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant "caused" the oil discharge, and the defendant's motion to dismiss the farmowners' claim must be denied. Gollobin v. Air Distrib. Co., 838 F. Supp. 255 (E.D. Va. 1993).

     Amount of damages.
    </b>
    - Trial court erred in upholding the state environmental quality department's decision to limit the corporation's reimbursement for its petroleum spill that damages another company's property to the reduction in market value of that property, instead of taking into account the corporation's settlement of the other company's damage suit against the corporation, as the settlement was an indicator of the reasonable and necessary costs that the corporation incurred, especially since there was a possibility of a broad range of damages that the other company could have recovered in its lawsuit against the corporation. 7-Eleven, Inc. v.

        - Petitioners' request to remand the Virginia State Water Control Board's amended regulations was denied because the Board clearly fulfilled its statutory obligation to "ensure" the prevention of "pollution," the General Assembly vested the Board with discretion to promulgate regulations permitting discharge under certain statutory conditions, and the Board was aided by an expert panel, staff presentation, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and testimony from interested persons both for and against the amendments (including the petitioners) pertaining to the land application, marketing, and distribution of biosolids, and conducted lengthy discussion and deliberations.

       Being cognizant of the crucial importance of the Commonwealth's water resources to the health and welfare of the people of Virginia and of the need of a water supply to assure further industrial growth and economic prosperity for the Commonwealth, and recognizing the necessity for continuous cooperative planning and effective state-level guidance in the use of water resources, the State Water Control Board is assigned the responsibility for planning the development, conservation and utilization of Virginia's water resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Board shall continue the study of existing water resources of the Commonwealth, means and methods of conserving and augmenting such water resources, and existing and contemplated uses and needs of water for all purposes. Based upon these studies and policies that have been initiated by the Division of Water Resources, and after an opportunity has been given to all concerned state agencies and political subdivisions to be heard, the Board shall formulate a coordinated policy for the use and control of all the water resources of the Commonwealth and issue a statement thereof. In formulating the Commonwealth's water resources policy, the Board shall, among other things, take into consideration the following principles and policies:

       <li id="t62.1c3.2s62.1-44.36ol11">
        Existing water rights are to be protected and preserved subject to the principle that all of the state waters belong to the public for use by the people for beneficial purposes without waste.

        Adequate and safe supplies shall be preserved and protected for human consumption, while conserving maximum supplies for other beneficial uses. When proposed uses of water are in mutually exclusive conflict or when available supplies of water are insufficient for all who desire to use them, preference shall be given to human consumption purposes over all other uses.
       </li>
       <li id="t62.1c3.2s62.1-44.36ol13">
        It is in the public interest that integration and coordination of uses of water, especially by localities with shared water supplies, and augmentation of existing supplies for all beneficial purposes be achieved for the maximum economic development thereof for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole.
       </li>
       <li id="t62.1c3.2s62.1-44.36ol14">
        In considering the benefits to be derived from drainage, consideration shall also be given to possible harmful effects upon ground water supplies and protection of wildlife.

       <li id="t62.1c3.2s62.1-44.36ol16">
        Watershed development policies shall be favored, whenever possible, for the preservation of balanced multiple uses, and project construction and planning with those ends in view shall be encouraged.

       Whereas it is recognized that abatement of existing pollution and the control of future pollution of interstate streams can best be promoted through a joint agency representing the several states located wholly or in part within the area drained by any such interstate stream; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the Congress of the United States has given its consent to the states of Maryland and West Virginia, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact providing for the creation of a conservancy district to consist of the drainage basin of the Potomac River and the main and tributary streams therein, for the purpose of regulating, controlling, preventing, or otherwise rendering unobjectionable and harmless the pollution of the waters of said Potomac drainage area by sewage and industrial and other wastes; and

      </p>
      <p>
       Now, therefore, the states of Maryland and West Virginia, the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the District of Columbia, hereinafter designated signatory bodies, do hereby create the Potomac Valley Conservancy District, hereinafter designated the Conservancy District comprising all of the area drained by the Potomac River and its tributaries; and also, do hereby create, as an agency of each signatory body, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, hereinafter designated the Commission, under the articles of organization as set forth below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article I
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin shall consist of three members from each signatory body and three members appointed by the President of the United States. Said Commissioners, other than those appointed by the President, shall be chosen in a manner and for the terms provided by law of the signatory body from which they are appointed and shall serve without compensation from the Commission but shall be paid by the Commission their actual expenses incurred and incident to the performance of their duties.

Such personnel as may be employed shall be employed without regard to any civil service or other similar requirements for employees of any of the signatory bodies. The Commission may maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the area of the signatory bodies.

        The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report thereof and shall in such report set forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact.

Each of the signatory bodies reserves the right to make at any time an examination and audit of the accounts of the Commission.

      </p>
      <p>
       (A) To collect, analyze, interpret, coordinate, tabulate, summarize and distribute technical and other data relative to, and to conduct studies, sponsor research and prepare reports on, pollution and other water problems of the Conservancy District.
      </p>
      <p>
       (B) To cooperate with the legislative and administrative agencies of the signatory bodies, or the equivalent thereof, and with other commissions and federal, local governmental and nongovernmental agencies, organizations, groups and persons for the purpose of promoting uniform laws, rules or regulations for the abatement and control of pollution of streams and the utilization, conservation and development of the water and associated land resources in the said Conservancy District.
      </p>
      <p>
       (C) To disseminate to the public information in relation to stream pollution problems and the utilization, conservation and development of the water and associated land resources of the Conservancy District and on the aims, views, purposes and recommendations of the Commission in relation thereto.
      </p>
      <p>
       (D) To cooperate with, assist, and provide liaison for and among, public and nonpublic agencies and organizations concerned with pollution and other water problems in the formulation and coordination of plans, programs and other activities relating to stream pollution or to the utilization, conservation or development of water or associated land resources, and to sponsor cooperative action in connection with the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) To establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory bodies through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in the District in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use, and for this purpose technical experts employed by appropriate state water pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two or more states. Each signatory body agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the Commission with its recommendations thereon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall review such classification and recommendations and accept or return the same with its comments. In the event of return, the signatory body will consider the comments of the Commission and resubmit the classification proposal, with or without amendment, with any additional comments for further action by the Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is agreed that after acceptance of such classification, the signatory body through its appropriate state water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet or exceed standards established by the Commission for classified waters. The Commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity and in a manner similar to that in which these standards and classifications were originally established.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, industrial and agricultural uses, navigation and disposal of wastes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article III
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of dealing with the problems of pollution and of water and associated land resources in specific areas which directly affect two or more, but not all, signatory bodies, the Commission may establish sections of the Commission consisting of the Commissioners from such affected signatory bodies; provided, however, that no signatory body may be excluded from any section in which it wishes to participate. The Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States may participate in any section. The Commission shall designate, and from time to time may change, the geographical area with respect to which each section shall function. Each section shall, to such extent as the Commission may from time to time authorize, have authority to exercise and perform with respect to its designated geographical area any power or function vested in the Commission, and in addition may exercise such other powers and perform such functions as may be vested in such section by the laws of any signatory body or by the laws of the United States. The exercise or performance by a section of any power or function vested in the Commission may be financed by the Commission, but the exercise or performance of powers or functions vested solely in a section shall be financed through funds provided in advance by the bodies, including the United States, participating in such section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IV
      </p>
      <p>
       The moneys necessary to finance the Commission in the administration of its business in the Conservancy District shall be provided through appropriations from the signatory bodies and the United States, in the manner prescribed by the laws of the several signatory bodies and of the United States, and in amounts as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       The pro rata contribution shall be based on such factors as population; the amount of industrial and domestic pollution; and a flat service charge, as shall be determined from time to time by the Commission, subject, however, to the approval, ratification and appropriation of such contribution by the several signatory bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article V

      <p>
       Whereas, a substantial part of the territory of each of the signatory states is situated within the drainage basin of the Ohio River;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, the rapid increase in the population of the various metropolitan areas situated within the Ohio drainage basin and the growth in industrial activity within that area have resulted in recent years in an increasingly serious pollution of the waters and streams within the said drainage basin, constituting a grave menace to the health, welfare, and recreational facilities of the people living in such basin, and occasioning great economic loss; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, the control of future pollution and the abatement of existing pollution in the waters of said basin are of prime importance to the people thereof and can best be accomplished through the cooperation of the states situated therein, by and through a joint or common agency;
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, therefore, the states of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia, do hereby covenant and agree as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Article I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of the signatory states pledges to each of the other signatory states faithful cooperation in the control of future pollution in and abatement of existing pollution from the rivers, streams, and waters in the Ohio River Basin which flow through, into or border upon any of such signatory states, and in order to effect such object agrees to enact any necessary legislation to enable each such state to police and maintain the waters of that basin in a satisfactory sanitary condition, available for safe and satisfactory use as public and industrial water supplies after reasonable treatment, suitable for recreational usage, capable of maintaining fish and other aquatic life, free from unsightly or malodorous nuisances due to floating solids or sludge deposits, and adaptable to such other uses as may be legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article II.
      </p>
      <p>
       The signatory states hereby create a district to be known as the "Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation District," hereinafter called the district, which shall embrace all territory within the signatory states, the water in which flows ultimately into the Ohio River, or its tributaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article III.
      </p>
      <p>
       The signatory states hereby create the "Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission," hereinafter called the Commission, which shall be a body corporate, with the powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the signatory states or by act or acts of the Congress of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IV.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall consist of three commissioners from each state, each of whom shall be a citizen of the state from which he is appointed, and three commissioners representing the United States government. The commissioners from each state shall be chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by the laws of the state from which they shall be appointed, and any commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which he shall be appointed. The Commissioners representing the United States shall be appointed by the President of the United States, or in such other manner as may be provided by Congress. The Commissioners shall serve without compensation, but shall be paid their actual expenses incurred in and incident to the performance of their duties; but nothing herein shall prevent the appointment of an officer or employee of any state or of the United States government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article V.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall elect from its number a chairman and vice-chairman, and shall appoint, and at its pleasure remove or discharge, such officers and legal, clerical, expert and other assistants as may be required to carry the provisions of this compact into effect, and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. It shall adopt a seal and suitable bylaws, and shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control. It may establish and maintain one or more offices within the district for the transaction of its business, and may meet at any time or place. One or more commissioners from a majority of the member states shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall submit to the governor of each state, at such time as he may request, a budget of its estimated expenditures, for such period as may be required by the laws of such state for presentation to the legislature thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall keep accurate books of account, showing in full its receipts and disbursements, and such books of account shall be open at any reasonable time to the inspection of such representatives of the respective signatory states as are duly constituted for that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       On or before the first day of December of each year, the Commission shall submit to the respective governors of the signatory states a full and complete report of its activities for the preceding year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Commission pledge the credit of any of the signatory states, except by and with the authority of the legislature thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VI.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is recognized by the signatory states that no single standard for the treatment of sewage or industrial wastes is applicable in all parts of the district due to such variable factors as size, flow, location, character, self-purification, and usage of waters within the district. The guiding principle of this compact shall be that pollution by sewage or industrial wastes originating within a signatory state shall not injuriously affect the various uses of the interstate waters as hereinbefore defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       All sewage from municipalities or other political subdivisions, public or private institutions, or corporations, discharged or permitted to flow into these portions of the Ohio River and its tributary waters which form boundaries between, or are contiguous to, two or more signatory states, or which flow from one signatory state into another signatory state, shall be so treated, within a time reasonable for the construction of the necessary works, as to provide for substantially complete removal of settleable solids and the removal of not less than forty-five per centum of the total suspended solids; provided that, in order to protect the public health or to preserve the waters for other legitimate purposes, including those specified in Article I, in specific instances such higher degree of treatment shall be used as may be determined to be necessary by the Commission after investigation, due notice and hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All industrial wastes discharged or permitted to flow into the aforesaid waters shall be modified or treated, within a time reasonable for the construction of the necessary works, in order to protect the public health or to preserve the waters for other legitimate purposes, including those specified in Article I, to such degree as may be determined to be necessary by the Commission after investigation, due notice and hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All sewage or industrial wastes discharged or permitted to flow into tributaries of the aforesaid waters situated wholly within one state shall be treated to that extent, if any, which may be necessary to maintain such waters in a sanitary and satisfactory condition at least equal to the condition of the waters of the interstate stream immediately above the confluence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission is hereby authorized to adopt, prescribe and promulgate rules, regulations and standards for administering and enforcing the provisions of this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state, or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state, imposing additional conditions and restrictions to further lessen or prevent the pollution of waters within its jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission shall conduct a survey of the territory included within the district, shall study the pollution problems of the district, and shall make a comprehensive report for the prevention or reduction of stream pollution therein. In preparing such report, the Commission shall confer with any national or regional planning body which may be established, and any department of the federal government authorized to deal with matters relating to the pollution problems of the district. The Commission shall draft and recommend to the governors of the various signatory states uniform legislation dealing with the pollution of rivers, streams and waters and other pollution problems within the district. The Commission shall consult with and advise the various states, communities, municipalities, corporations, persons, or other entities with regard to particular problems connected with the pollution of waters, particularly, with regard to the construction of plants for the disposal of sewage, industrial and other waste. The Commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature of any state which is a party thereto, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by any legislature in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IX.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission may from time to time after investigation and after a hearing, issue an order or orders upon any municipality, corporation, person, or other entity discharging sewage or industrial waste into the Ohio River, or any other river, stream or water, any part of which constitutes any part of the boundary line between any two or more of the signatory states, or into any stream any part of which flows from any portion of one signatory state through any portion of another signatory state. Any such order or orders may prescribe the date on or before which such discharge shall be wholly or partially discontinued, modified or treated or otherwise disposed of. The Commission shall give reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing to the municipality, corporation or other entity against which such order is proposed. No such order shall go into effect unless and until it receives the assent of at least a majority of the commissioners from each or not less than a majority of the signatory states; and no such order upon a municipality, corporation, person or entity in any state shall go into effect unless and until it receives the assent of not less than a majority of the commissioners from such state.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shall be the duty of the municipality, corporation, person or other entity to comply with any such order issued against it or him by the Commission, and any court of general jurisdiction or any United States district court in any of the signatory states shall have the jurisdiction, by mandamus, injunction, specific performance or other form of remedy to enforce any such order against any municipality, corporation or other entity domiciled or located within such state or whose discharge of the waste takes place within or adjoining such state, or against any employee, department or subdivision of such municipality, corporation, person or other entity; provided, that such court may review the order and affirm, reverse or modify the same upon any of the grounds customarily applicable in proceedings for court review of administrative decisions. The Commission or, at its request, the Attorney General or other law enforcing official, shall have power to institute in such court any action for the enforcement of such order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The signatory states agree to appropriate for the salaries, office and other administrative expenses, their proper proportion of the annual budget as determined by the Commission and approved by the governors of the signatory states, one half of such amount to be prorated among the several states in proportion of their population within the district at the last preceding federal census, the other half to be prorated in proportion to their land area within the district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article XI.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall become effective upon ratification by the legislatures of a majority of the states located within the district and upon approval by the Congress of the United States; and shall become effective as to any additional states signing thereafter at the time of such signing.

     "Waters within the Commonwealth."
    </b>
    - The term "waters of the Commonwealth" is defined in this section to include navigable streams and "any stream or part thereof . . . in which the construction of any dam or works as authorized by this chapter would affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce." While the term "waters within the Commonwealth" is not defined, it is obviously meant to include all streams not described as "waters of the Commonwealth." Vaughan v.

     Relationship of first and second portions of subdivision (c) construed.
    </b>
    - Where it was contended that since the first portion of subdivision (c) of this section dealt with streams suitable for or used for water transportation, the second part dealing with works which would affect foreign or interstate commerce, under a familiar canon of construction, must deal with some other situation or be meaningless (that is to say, that it must apply whenever land-borne, foreign or interstate commerce is affected), it was held that this was not necessarily true, as a case might arise where, without extending the second part to land-borne commerce, the construction put upon the portion by the Corporation Commission would be far from meaningless. Garden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., <cite class="va_code">153 Va. 659</cite>, 151 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 161</cite> (1930).

        <b>
     Land-borne traffic in interstate commerce unaffected.
    </b>
    - To extend the provision in subdivision (c) of this section to the interruption of land-borne traffic in interstate or foreign commerce, would hamper the growth of waterpower and would at times impose impossible burdens. Garden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., <cite class="va_code">153 Va. 659</cite>, 151 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 161</cite> (1930).

        <b>
     The only traffic contemplated being water-borne.
    </b>
    - The only traffic contemplated under this section, whose interruption might necessitate the Commission's judgment, is water-borne traffic, that traffic possible on the "waters of the State." Garden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., <cite class="va_code">153 Va. 659</cite>, 151 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 161</cite> (1930).

As to "waters within the Commonwealth," the authority of the Commission is limited to the licensing of a dam for hydroelectric purposes only. But as to "waters of the Commonwealth," the authority of the Commission extends to the licensing of any dam proposed to be constructed in or across such waters regardless of the purpose for which the dam is to be used.

The purpose of this last provision is patent. It was designed to prevent preemption of dam sites taken to forestall competition, to prevent speculation and to force present adequate development which without such safeguards might be retarded rather than promoted.

       In addition to any right or power of eminent domain that it may have under existing law, every public service corporation engaged in the development of waterpower in this Commonwealth for the production, sale and supply of hydroelectric power and energy to the public shall be vested with the right of eminent domain to the full extent requisite for the acquisition of all lands, property and rights necessary for the purpose of the construction, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any dam, reservoir, power station and/or other structures of any such water-power development, subject to the following provisions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t62.1c07s62.1-98ol11">
        Such corporation may, by the exercise of such right for such purpose, acquire all necessary lands, property and rights of whatsoever nature, whether or not such lands, property or rights have been theretofore appropriated or devoted, or sought to be appropriated or devoted to public use, including but not restricted to, the lands, property and rights necessary for any storage, diversion, regulation, detention, or interference with the flow of any water and for any waterway and including also, but not restricted to, any lands, structures, property or rights owned, used or held by or for public or private, religious, charitable, educational or cemetery purposes; any dwelling houses and any public or private roads and bridges, and any other property, public or private, when necessary for such purpose; provided, however, that the right of eminent domain under this section shall not be available against existing public-carrier railroads; and provided further that, in the event of the condemnation under this chapter of any roads or bridges, the commissioners or jurors in assessing the compensation and damages therefor, shall consider the cost of relocating and constructing such roads or bridges upon other reasonable convenient locations, and the damage, if any, to persons and corporations because of relocation and construction. No such corporation shall impair the drinking water supply of any city or town or acquire any municipal electric light and power or water plant by virtue of any additional powers conferred by this chapter; provided further that the provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize the acquisition by condemnation or otherwise of any streets or alleys or portions thereof in incorporated cities or towns.

        When, in the operation of any dam, power station or other structure of a water-power development, any such public service corporation interferes, to an extent beyond its common-law riparian rights, with the flow of water downstream from such structure and by reason of such interference any property or riparian right, or any part thereof or interest therein, is destroyed or damaged, such corporation may exercise the right of eminent domain for the purpose of acquiring such property, right or interest so destroyed or of ascertaining and paying just compensation for any such damage.
       </li>
       <li id="t62.1c07s62.1-98ol13">
        In connection with the exercise of the right of eminent domain over public and private cemeteries, such corporation shall also have the right to acquire by condemnation proceedings other lands to which to remove the bodies and monuments or other structures from such public or private cemeteries. All the rights of the owners, including the Commonwealth, in and to the lands in such cemeteries shall pass to and vest in such corporation and the title to the lands acquired for the removal of such cemeteries shall vest in the former owners and such others as may have rights therein of such cemeteries so removed. However, before such corporation may flood or otherwise utilize any such cemetery, it shall remove the bodies and monuments or other structures to the lands acquired for such purpose and reinter the bodies and reset the monuments, under the direction and to the satisfaction of the court in which such condemnation proceedings are brought. If the parties in interest fail to agree as to the location and area of the additional lands to be acquired in which to reinter the bodies and on which to rest the monuments and other structures, the same shall be determined by the court.

        For the purpose of relocating any railway, pipeline, wire line, road or bridge occupying the area on which any such water-power development or enlargement thereof is to be located, such corporation may acquire by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, any needful additional lands or other property, whether within or without the area upon such water-power development or enlargement thereof is to be located, and shall have the right for such purpose and shall convey such lands or other property or rights to the owner of such railway, pipeline, wire line, road or bridge.

       <li id="t62.1c07s62.1-98ol15">
        In all cases of the exercise of such right of eminent domain just compensation shall be paid to the owners and tenants of the property taken or damaged, in the manner provided by law for all property taken or damaged.

      <p>
       Any riparian owner, or riparian owners, desiring to store floodwaters under the conditions specified in § 62.1-106 may apply for leave so to do to the circuit court of the county or city wherein the impounding structure is proposed to be built. Such application shall be made by petition filed in the clerk's office of the court. It shall set forth the name and address of the riparian owner, or owners, the purpose of the proposed impoundment, the desired storage capacity and the basis on which determined, the stream and the point on it from which floodwaters are proposed to be taken, the estimated cost of the project, and an agreement to abide by the provisions of § 62.1-106. It shall be accompanied by a plat or sketch of the riparian property which he or they own and on which is shown the site of the impounding structure and the area to be flooded by the impounded water. The plat or sketch shall include data sufficient to permit the location of the property on the official highway map of the county or a map of the city or town where appropriate. It shall also be accompanied by a plan of the proposed impounding structure on which appears the approval of the plan by a registered civil engineer or registered agricultural engineer, (or other competent person for storage capacities of fifty acre-feet or less) and agreement thereto by the riparian owner. All interested persons shall be given notice of such application by publication in accordance with <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-316" target="_blank">§§ 8.01-316</a></cite> and<cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.8.01.html#t8.01s8.01-317" target="_blank"> 8.01-317</a></cite>.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The commissioners, before entering upon their duties, shall take an oath faithfully to perform the same, and thereupon shall proceed to inquire and ascertain, if the leave be granted, whether the mansion house of any person, or the outhouses, yard, garden, or orchards thereto belonging, will be overflowed or taken; whether and in what degree ordinary navigation and the passage of fish will be obstructed; whether by any, and if any, by what means such obstruction may be prevented; and whether the health of the neighbors will be annoyed by the stagnation of the waters or otherwise. They shall also circumscribe so much of the lands, not owned by the applicant, as may be necessary for the canal, dam, or work to be constructed as aforesaid, not being (beyond what is in the bed of the watercourse) more than one acre for a dam, nor more than 100 feet in width for a canal, and shall ascertain what will be a just compensation therefor. Any lands which will probably be overflowed or deprived of water, or otherwise injured by such canal or dam, or be injured by the construction of the work aforesaid, shall likewise be examined by them, and they shall ascertain what will be a just compensation to the several owners thereof, for the damage to the same respectively. All of which matters the commissioners shall set forth in a report, which they shall make out, sign, and return to the court by which they were appointed.

        <b>
         When inquisition sufficient.
        </b>
        - The inquisition in a mill case is sufficient, where upon a fair and reasonable construction, it is substantially responsive to the requirements of the statute. Mairs v. Gallahue, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 94 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Commissioners may name height of dam where application omits it.
        </b>
        - Where the petition does not specify the height proposed to be erected, it is proper and correct for the commissioners to name that height in their inquisition. Mairs v. Gallahue, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 94 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Duties where application is to raise a dam already erected.
        </b>
        - It is as necessary that an inquest should be had as to injuring the health of neighbors, obstructing navigation, etc., on an application to raise a milldam already erected as to construct it originally. The verdict in such case responding only to the damage done a contiguous owner by flooding his land and not to the health of neighbors, etc., is imperfect; and the inquest will be quashed. Kownslar v. Ward, 21 Va. (Gilmer) 127 (1820).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a petition for leave to add to the height of a milldam, the only proper subject of inquiry is, what damages will be occasioned by the proposed addition. It is error, therefore, to direct the commissioners to assess such other damages, accruing from the dam already erected, as were not contemplated by the original jury (now commission). But an error in this respect should be regarded as surplusage, if the commissioners assessed such erroneous damages separately, and the court did not direct the same to be paid, but only the damages properly assessed. Eppes v. Cralle, 15 Va. (1 Munf.) 258 (1810).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Accidental injury need not be set forth in report.
        </b>
        - It is not necessary that the inquisition should set forth the injury which the land below the dam may sustain through accidental means which might never occur. Wroe v. Harris, 2 Va. (2 Wash.) 126 (1795).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And report need not set out by metes and bounds land injured.
        </b>
        - It is not necessary in a mill case that the land injured should be set out by the metes and bounds, and the finding in the inquest that the proprietor's land had been injured by the overflowing of the waters produced by the erection of the dam, and that the damages assessed were on that account, is sufficiently specific. Nash v. Upper Appomattox Co., 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 332 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Sufficient compliance where one commissioner signs report for others.
    </b>
    - Where commissioners, appointed to inquire and report upon the propriety and expediency of flooding land by a milldam, meet upon the land and agree upon a report which they authorize one of their number to write out and sign for them, and such report is so written out and signed, and afterwards acknowledged and adopted by all the commissioners in open court, this is a reasonable and sufficient compliance with the law.

      <p>
       If, on the report, or on other evidence, it appears to the court that by granting such leave the mansion house of any person other than the applicant himself, or the outhouses, yard, garden, or orchards thereto belonging, will be overflowed or taken, or that the health of the neighbor will be annoyed, the leave shall not be granted. But if it shall not so appear, the court shall then grant or refuse the leave, as may seem to it proper. If it be granted, the court shall lay the applicant under such terms and conditions as shall seem to it right. It shall, in particular, provide, that ordinary navigation and the passage of fish shall not be obstructed, nor the convenient crossing of the watercourse impeded; and where, under such leave, an existing mill, manufactory, machine, or engine is to be supplied with water by a canal, the court shall prescribe a time within which the dam, whereby water had before been supplied, shall be abated, which time shall not be more than one year from the completion of the canal. Whenever such leave is granted, the tenant of any land through which any canal may be cut, may cross it with such fencing, and bridges, and erect such water gates as he may from time to time deem necessary, not obstructing the passage of the water to the mill, manufactory, machine, or engine.

    </b>
    - The report of commissioners, duly appointed under the provisions of
    
     §
    
    62.1-118, that if leave is granted to erect a milldam at a given place "the health of the neighborhood will be annoyed by the stagnation of water caused by said pond producing malaria, chills and fever," is, under the provisions of this section, conclusive against the applicant to erect the dam, and no evidence will be heard against it. Mayo v. Turner, 15 Va. (1 Munf.) 405 (1810); Bishop v. Bagley, <cite class="va_code">104 Va. 29</cite>, 51 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 205</cite> (1905).

         Virginia International Terminal not a mere alter ego of state.
        </b>
        - While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT) has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fact that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VIT's independent corporate existence, compelled the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney general's opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v. Virginia Int'l Terms., Inc., 679 F. Supp. 587 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 857 F.2d 977 (4th Cir. 1988).

Such trust or equivalent arrangement shall be irrevocable; the assets of such trust or similar arrangement shall be dedicated to providing benefits to retirees and their beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the plan or programs providing postemployment benefits other than pensions; and the assets of such trust or equivalent arrangement shall be exempt from taxation and execution, attachment, garnishment or any other process against the Authority or a retiree or beneficiary. The funds of the trust or similar arrangement shall be deemed separate, and independent trust funds shall be segregated from all other funds of the Authority, and shall be invested and administered solely in the interests of the active or former employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) entitled to postemployment benefits other than pensions covered by the Fund.

However, postemployment benefits other than pensions shall not include defined benefit pension plans for retirees and eligible dependents of retirees, termination benefits or other pension benefits.

       The Authority is hereby vested with the power of eminent domain to acquire property or any interest therein, however held, but not property of the Commonwealth or its agencies, and may exercise the same for the purposes set forth in §§ 62.1-132.18 and 62.1-132.19 in the manner and to the extent set forth in, and subject to the provisions of, Chapter 2 (§ 25.1-200 et seq.) of Title 25.1; provided that the Authority shall have no power to condemn any property belonging to any other political subdivision of the Commonwealth, or to any common carrier, or public utility or other public service corporation which is being devoted to public use or service. Whether property is being devoted to public use or service in the case of a public service corporation, common carrier, or public utility, shall be decided by the State Corporation Commission in a proceeding under § 25.1-102; and in the case of a political subdivision shall be decided by the court in which the proceeding is brought.

       For purposes of the limitations imposed by subsections B and C of § 62.1-140, the term
       "revenue bonds"
       means bonds for which only the revenues of port facilities are pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the bonds of one or more series of the bonds of the Authority at any time outstanding may be refunded by the Authority by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the Authority may deem necessary, but not exceeding an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with all unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and with any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as determined by the Authority. The proceeds of any such refunding bonds may, in the discretion of the Authority, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding revenue bonds either on their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or upon the purchase or at the maturity thereof, and may, pending such application, be placed in trust in accordance with the provisions of § 62.1-143 of this chapter to be applied to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date as may be determined by the Authority. All refunding bonds may have all of the attributes of revenue bonds to the extent that such other provisions of this chapter relating to revenue bonds may be applicable to refunding bonds.

       All bonds shall be signed by the Executive Director of the Authority or shall bear his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary of the Authority, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Executive Director of the Authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction and control of port facilities or the portion thereof for which such bonds shall have been issued, or, in the case of refunding bonds, to refund such bonds including any unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses incident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as shall be determined by the Authority upon the issuance of such refunding bonds, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or, if such bonds shall have been issued for paying the cost of a portion of the project, such surplus may be applied to the payment of the cost of any remaining portion of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Authority shall not issue any bonds, other than revenue bonds or any refunding bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the second paragraph of subsection B of § 62.1-140, which are not specifically authorized by a bill or resolution passed by a majority vote of those elected to each house of the General Assembly.
    Refunding bonds may only be issued with the consent of the Governor.
    However, the Governor, in his sole discretion, may approve bonds which have not been authorized by the General Assembly if such bonds are to finance capital projects that emerge between legislative sessions, provided the debt is required to stimulate commerce consistent with § 62.1-132.3 and provided that:

       In the discretion of the Authority any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the port facilities or any part thereof; provided, however, the Authority may make a purchase-money agreement giving a chattel mortgage or lien on personal property or operating equipment purchased for use in its facilities. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the port facilities or the portion thereof in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates to be charged, the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the port facilities or portion thereof.

       The Authority is hereby authorized to fix and revise charges for the use of the port facilities under its control and the different parts or sections thereof, and to contract with any person, partnership, association or corporation desiring the use of any part thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents and rates of charges for such use. Such charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate of charges from the port facility or the portion or portions thereof in connection with which revenue bonds or refunding bonds shall have been issued under the provisions of this chapter as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating such port facility or portion or portions and (b) the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable, and to create reserves for such purposes. Such charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any commission, board, bureau or agency of the Commonwealth or of any municipality, county or other political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The charges and all other revenues derived from the port facility or portion or portions in connection with which such bonds shall have been issued except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the charges and other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority. The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement. Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. In addition to all other powers granted to the Authority by this chapter, the Authority is hereby authorized to pledge to the payment of the principal of and the interest on any bonds under the provisions of this chapter any moneys received or to be received by it under any appropriation made to it by the General Assembly, unless the appropriation is restricted by the General Assembly to specific purposes of the Authority or such pledge is prohibited by the law making such appropriations; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to obligate the General Assembly to make any such appropriation.

      <p>
       All moneys received pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds or refunding bonds or as revenues, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this chapter. The Authority shall, in the resolution authorizing such bonds or in the trust agreement securing such bonds, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues to be received to a trustee, which shall be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth, who shall act as trustee of the funds, and hold and apply the same to the purposes of this chapter, subject to such regulations as this chapter and such resolution or trust agreement may provide. In the case of the proceeds of the sale of revenue bonds or revenues, the trustee may invest and reinvest such funds pending their need for the construction of the project in securities that are legal investments under the laws of the Commonwealth for funds held by fiduciaries. In the case of the proceeds of the sale of refunding bonds, the trustee may invest and reinvest such funds in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and the interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America. Such money and the interest, income and profits, if any, earned on such investment, shall be available for the payment of all or any part of the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the bonds being refunded. The proceeds of the sale of refunding bonds shall be so invested and applied as to assure that the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds being refunded shall be paid in full on their respective maturity, redemption or interest payment dates. After the terms of the trust have been fully satisfied, and carried out, any balance of such proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the Authority for use by it in any lawful manner.

     A riparian owner has the right to the water frontage belonging by nature to his land.

    Upon this soil, the owner may erect wharves, piers, or bulkheads for his own use, or the use of the public, subject to such rules and regulations as the General Assembly may impose for the public's protection, and the enjoyment of this right is made subject by this section to the limitation that its exercise shall not result in obstruction of navigation or in injury to private rights.

       <p>
        Pursuant to governing law, the property owner's rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the line of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owner's roof and second-story deck added to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commission's permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private pier's placement for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Any person desiring the privilege of erecting a wharf at or on any county landing may, after giving notice of his intention by advertising such notice at some public place near the landing, and also at the front door of the courthouse of such county, on the first day of a term of the circuit court of the county, present to the court at its next term a petition for such privilege. The court may determine the same, and may, in its discretion, grant such privilege and fix such rates and charges upon such conditions and limitations as to it may seem fit. The court, at any subsequent term, may, if it think proper, revoke such privilege, or alter such conditions or limitations, or regulate the rates and charges. This section shall not be construed to authorize a circuit court of the county to grant the privilege of erecting a wharf within a city.

        - This chapter gives the owner of riparian land the right to dig and sell sand and gravel from deposits which extended uninterruptedly from low-water mark into abutting tidal waters, and for the loss of this right through condemnation, the owner was entitled to be compensated.

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       The General Assembly finds that there exists in the Commonwealth a critical need for additional sources of funding to finance the present and future needs of the Commonwealth for water supply; land conservation or land preservation including land for parks and other recreational purposes; oyster restoration projects, including planting and replanting with seed oysters, oyster shells, or other material that will catch, support, and grow oysters; wastewater treatment facilities; drainage facilities; solid waste treatment, disposal and management facilities; recycling facilities; resource recovery facilities; energy conservation and energy efficiency projects; professional sports facilities; certain heavy rail transportation facilities; public safety facilities; airport facilities; the remediation of brownfields and contaminated properties, including properties contaminated by defective drywall; the design and construction of roads, public parking garages and other public transportation facilities, and facilities for public transportation by commuter rail; construction of local government buildings, including administrative and operations systems and other local government equipment and infrastructure; site acquisition and site development work for economic and community development projects; recovered gas energy facilities; the location or retention of federal facilities in the Commonwealth and the support of the transition of former federal facilities from use by the federal government to other uses; and renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, biomass, waste-to-energy, and geothermal. This need can be alleviated in part through the creation of a resources authority. Its purpose is to encourage the investment of both public and private funds and to make loans, grants, and credit enhancements available to local governments to finance water and sewer projects, land conservation or land preservation programs or projects, oyster restoration projects, drainage projects, solid waste treatment, disposal and management projects, recycling projects, energy conservation and energy efficiency projects, professional sports facilities, resource recovery projects, public safety facilities, airport facilities, the remediation of brownfields and contaminated properties including properties contaminated by defective drywall, the design and construction of roads, public parking garages and other public transportation facilities, and facilities for public transportation by commuter rail, site acquisition and site development work for the benefit of economic development projects, technology, construction of local government buildings, including administrative and operations systems and other local government equipment and infrastructure, infrastructure for broadband services, recovered gas energy facilities, federal facilities or former federal facilities, and renewable energy projects. The General Assembly determines that the creation of an authority for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience or prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth.

       Whenever it appears to the Governor from an affidavit filed with him by the Authority as the purchaser, holder, or credit enhancer of local obligations (regardless of the security therefor) issued by any county, city or town that a payment has not been made on any local obligations, the Governor shall immediately make a summary investigation into the facts set forth in the affidavit. The Authority may, but shall not be required to, file such an affidavit unless the Authority has otherwise contracted to make such filing for the benefit of the holders of any of its bonds or the local obligations credit enhanced by it. The affidavit described in this section may be filed by a trustee to which the Authority has assigned the local obligations or the payment thereon as security for bonds of the Authority under a resolution or trust indenture or otherwise.

       If it is established to the satisfaction of the Governor that such nonpayment has occurred, the Governor shall immediately make an order directing the Comptroller to withhold all further payment to the county, city or town of all funds, or of any part of them, appropriated and payable by the Commonwealth to the county, city or town for any and all purposes, until the unpaid sum is obtained. The Governor shall, while the nonpayment continues, direct in writing the payment of all sums withheld by the Comptroller, or as much of them as is necessary, to the Authority, so as to cure, or cure insofar as possible, nonpayment on the local obligations.

      <p>
       The Governor shall, as soon as practicable, give notice of the nonpayment and of the availability of funds with the Comptroller in writing to the Authority. Any payment so made by the Comptroller to the Authority shall be credited as if made directly by the county, city or town and shall be charged by the Comptroller against the first appropriations otherwise payable to the county, city or town as if paid to the county, city or town. The Authority, at the time of payment or at the time of each payment shall receipt for the payment and deliver to the Comptroller all local obligations or other instruments or documents, in a form satisfactory to the Comptroller, evidencing the Authority's right to receive the amounts satisfied by the payment. The Comptroller shall report each payment made to the governing body of the nonpaying county, city or town and deliver or send by registered mail to the governing body all local obligations, or other instruments or documents received by the Comptroller under the provisions of this section.

      <p>
       It is the policy of the Commonwealth to prioritize universal access to wastewater treatment that protects public health and the environment and supports local economic growth and stability. To further this policy, the Commonwealth endorses (i) public education about the importance of adequate wastewater treatment; (ii) collaboration among local, state, and federal government entities, including consistent collaboration and coordination of grant requirements and timelines; (iii) the prioritized, focused, and innovative use of state and federal funding to address needs determined pursuant to § 62.1-223.3; (iv) a preference for community-based and regional projects as opposed to cumulative and repetitive site-by-site individual solutions; (v) the use of integrated solutions across sewer and onsite wastewater treatment systems; and (vi) the incorporation of the effects of climate change into wastewater treatment regulatory and funding programs.

       Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, money in the Fund shall be used solely to make loans to local governments or other entities as permitted by federal law to finance or refinance the cost of any project. The local governments or other entities to which loans are to be made, the purposes of the loan, the amount of each such loan, the interest rate thereon and the repayment terms thereof, which may vary between loan recipients, shall be designated in writing by the Board to the Authority following consultation with the Authority.

      <p>
       There is hereby established the Combined Sewer Overflow Matching Fund ("Fund") to match federal money for purposes of providing grants to localities for CSO projects.
    The Fund shall be established out of the sums appropriated from time to time by the General Assembly for the purpose of matching federal funds allocated to Virginia for CSO controls.
    The Fund, and all income from the investment of moneys held in the Fund and any other sums designated for deposit to the Fund from any source, public or private, shall be set apart as a permanent and perpetual fund, subject to liquidation only upon the solution of Virginia's combined sewer overflow problems, as may be determined by the General Assembly.
    The Fund shall be administered and managed by the Virginia Resources Authority, subject to the right of the State Water Control Board, following consultation with the Authority, to direct the distribution of grants from the Fund to particular local governments.
    The State Water Control Board may establish such terms and conditions on any grant as it deems appropriate, and grants shall be disbursed from the Fund by the Virginia Resources Authority in accordance with the written direction of the State Water Control Board.

      </p>
      <p>
       "Surface water withdrawal permit"
       means a document issued by the Board evidencing the right to withdraw surface water.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Surface water management area"
       means a geographically defined surface water area in which the Board has deemed the levels or supply of surface water to be potentially adverse to public welfare, health and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Surface water"
       means any water in the Commonwealth, except ground water, as defined in § 62.1-255.

      <p>
       When reviewing an application for a permit to withdraw ground water, or an amendment to a permit, the Board may consider the nature of the proposed beneficial use, the proposed use of alternate or innovative approaches such as aquifer storage and recovery systems and surface and ground water conjunctive uses, climatic cycles, unique requirements for nuclear power stations, economic cycles, population projections, the status of land use and other necessary approvals, and the adoption and implementation of the applicant's water conservation and management plan. In no case shall a permit be issued for more ground water than can be applied to the proposed beneficial use.
      </p>
      <p>
       When proposed uses of ground water are in conflict or when available supplies of ground water are insufficient for all who desire to use them, preference shall be given to uses for human consumption, over all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       In evaluating permit applications, the Board shall ensure that the maximum possible safe supply of ground water will be preserved and protected for all other beneficial uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       In evaluating the available ground water with respect to permit applications for new or expanded withdrawals in the Eastern Virginia or Eastern Shore Groundwater Management Areas, the Board shall use the average of the actual historical ground water usage from the inception of the ground water withdrawals of a political subdivision or authority operating a ground water and surface water conjunctive use system and shall not use the total permit capacity of such system in determining such availability.
