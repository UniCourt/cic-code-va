        - This section contemplates that the person claiming the right to erect the gates shall own land on both sides of the road or right-of-way, and have fences which "extend to such roads on each side thereof," and the burden is on the claimant to show that he is within the provisions of the statute.

         Application not prevented by narrowness of land on one side of way.

        - Two gates were erected across a private right-of-way appurtenant to complainant's land, over the adjoining land of defendants. One gate was in a fence erected entirely on land of the defendants who owned land on both sides of the right-of-way. Complainant contended that this section did not apply because defendants only owned a strip of land 18' wide between complainant's line and the way, and same was of little value. It was held that the gate came squarely within the provisions of the statute. Good v. Petticrew,

The landowners were barred as a matter of law from placing a gate across the right of way only if they were subject to a contractual provision prohibiting the installation of a gate. The plat appended to the deed showed the route of the easement and did not indicate any restrictions that would prohibit the placement of a gate across the easement.

         "Without let or hindrance" construed.
        </b>
        - The expression "without let or hindrance," while including the concept of a permanent obstruction, is also broad enough to include something far less. Waskey v. Lewis,

        The clause "no change shall be made"

       does not prohibit the construction, relocation and inclusion in the highway system of a new road. That restriction against relocation of an existing highway refers only to those state highways running to and from points named in Chapter 10, Acts 1918, that had been located and established prior to the effective date of Chapter 31, Acts 1919. And even if established then, the correct construction of the clause would not preclude the location, establishment, construction and inclusion of another section of highway in the system which may shorten the distance between existing points, where no intention or purpose is disclosed to abandon any part of the old route.(decided under prior law) McMinn v.

      1. That the Commonwealth Transportation Board shall amend its regulations so as to permit mobile food vending on state highway rights-of-way except limited access highways. Such regulations may provide for the issuance of permits by the Department of Transportation to mobile food vendors authorizing such vendors to operate on state highway rights-of-way in certain business districts, urban development areas, or areas zoned for commercial use and limited to specific locations within those business districts, urban development areas, or areas zoned for commercial use where the Department of Transportation has determined that motor vehicle traffic flow and motorist and pedestrian safety on the state highway rights-of-way would not be adversely affected by the operation of the mobile food vendors. The Department of Transportation shall seek input from affected localities and other stakeholders during the process of amending the regulations authorized by this section. Such regulations shall allow localities to regulate the operation of such mobile food vending businesses located on the state highway rights-of-way within the locality in a manner consistent with local ordinances and the Commonwealth Transportation Board's regulations and policies."

        Aim in adopting traffic devices manual.
       </b>
       - Nothing inherent in the authority invoked by the Board when it adopted the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as a standard suggests that railroads would be relieved of their responsibility to discover especially hazardous crossings and to erect lights and other appropriate protective devices at such crossings. Rather, the adoption of MUTCD seems to have been aimed principally at setting standards to make highway safety measures implemented by local agencies consistent with those implemented by state agencies.

      , located within the Commonwealth shall not be used for such purposes unless such private entity pays the Department an annual naming rights fee as determined by the Board. The Department shall place and maintain appropriate signs indicating the names of highways, bridges, interchanges, and other transportation facilities named by the Board or by the General Assembly. The costs of producing, placing, and maintaining these signs shall be paid by the localities in which they are located or by the private entity whose name is attached to the highway, bridge, interchange, or other transportation facility. However, for a highway, bridge, interchange, or other transportation facility named after a state official killed during the performance of his official duties, the costs of producing, placing, and maintaining these signs shall be paid from Commonwealth Transportation Funds. For purposes of this section, "state official" includes law-enforcement officers employed by the Department of State Police and state highway transportation workers. No name shall be given to any state highway, bridge, interchange, or other transportation facility by the Board unless and until the Board receives (i) for a naming after a state official, a letter or resolution from the head of the state agency by which the state official was employed requesting such naming or (ii) for a naming other than after a state official, a resolution from the governing body of the locality within which a portion of the facility to be named is located requesting such naming, except in such cases where a private entity has requested the naming. No highway, bridge, interchange, or other transportation facility previously named by the Board or the General Assembly shall be eligible for renaming by a private entity, unless such naming incorporates the previous name. The Board shall develop and approve guidelines governing the naming of highways, bridges, interchanges, and other transportation facilities by private entities and the applicable fees for such naming rights. Such fees shall be deposited in the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund established pursuant to §

If a locality or metropolitan planning organization requests the termination of a project, and the Department does not agree to the termination, or if a locality or metropolitan planning organization does not advance a project to the next phase of construction when requested by the Board and the Department has expended state or federal funds, the locality or the localities within the metropolitan planning organization may be required to reimburse the Department for all funds expended on the project. If, after design approval by the Chief Engineer of the Department, a locality or metropolitan planning organization requests alterations to a project that, in the aggregate, exceeds 10 percent of the total project costs, the locality or the localities within the metropolitan planning organization may be required to reimburse the Department for the additional project costs above the original estimates for making such alterations.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When authorization is required by federal or state law for any project affecting wetlands and such authorization is conditioned upon compensatory mitigation for adverse impacts to wetlands, the Commissioner of Highways is authorized to expend funds for the purchase of, or is authorized to use, credits from any wetlands mitigation bank, including any owned by the Department of Transportation, that has been approved and is operating in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use, and operation of mitigation banks as long as (i) the bank is in the same fourth order subbasin, as defined by the hydrologic unit boundaries of the National Watershed Boundary Dataset or by the hydrologic unit system or dataset utilized and depicted or described in the bank's approved mitigation banking instrument, as the impacted site, or in an adjacent subbasin within the same river watershed as the impacted site, or it meets all the conditions found in clauses (a) through (d) and either clause (e) or (f); (ii) the bank is ecologically preferable to practicable on-site and off-site individual mitigation options, as defined by federal wetland regulations; and (iii) the banking instrument, if approved after July 1, 1996, has been approved by a process that included public review and comment. When the bank is not located in the same subbasin or adjacent subbasin within the same river watershed as the impacted site, the purchase or use of credits shall not be allowed unless the Commissioner of Highways demonstrates to the satisfaction of the agency requiring compensatory mitigation that (a) the impacts will occur as a result of a Department of Transportation linear project; (b) there is no practical same river watershed mitigation alternative; (c) the impacts are less than one acre in a single and complete project within a subbasin; (d) there is no significant harm to water quality or fish and wildlife resources within the river watershed of the impacted site; and either (e) impacts within the Chesapeake Bay watershed are mitigated within the Chesapeake Bay watershed as close as possible to the impacted site or (f) impacts within subbasins 02080108, 02080208, and 03010205, as defined by the National Watershed Boundary Dataset, are mitigated in-kind within those subbasins, as close as possible to the impacted site. After July 1, 2002, the provisions of clause (f) shall apply only to impacts within subdivisions of the listed subbasins where overlapping watersheds exist, as determined by the Department of Environmental Quality, provided the Department of Environmental Quality has made such a determination by that date. For the purposes of this subsection, the hydrologic unit boundaries of the National Watershed Boundary Dataset or other hydrologic unit system may be adjusted by the Department of Environmental Quality to reflect site-specific geographic or hydrologic information provided by the bank sponsor.

Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that this chapter is necessary for the public convenience, safety, and welfare.

       § 33.2-331. Annual meeting with county officers; six-year plan for secondary state highways; certain reimbursements required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, "cancellation" means complete elimination of a highway construction or improvement project from the six-year plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body of each county in the secondary state highway system may, jointly with the representatives of the Department as designated by the Commissioner of Highways, prepare a six-year plan for the improvements to the secondary state highway system in that county. Each such six-year plan shall be based upon the best estimate of funds to be available to the county for expenditure in the six-year period on the secondary state highway system. Each such plan shall list the proposed improvements, together with an estimated cost of each project so listed. Following the preparation of the plan in any year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $100,000, the board of supervisors or other local governing body shall conduct a public hearing after publishing notice in a newspaper published in or having general circulation in the county once a week for two successive weeks and posting notice of the proposed hearing at the front door of the courthouse of such county 10 days before the meeting. At the public hearings, which shall be conducted jointly by the board of supervisors and the representative of the Department, the entire six-year plan shall be discussed with the citizens of the county and their views considered. Following the discussion, the local governing body, together with the representative of the Department, shall finalize and officially adopt the six-year plan, which shall then be considered the official plan of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least once in each calendar year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $100,000, representatives of the Department in charge of the secondary state highway system in each county, or some representative of the Department designated by the Commissioner of Highways, shall meet with the governing body of each county in a regular or special meeting of the local governing body for the purpose of preparing a budget for the expenditure of improvement funds for the next fiscal year. The representative of the Department shall furnish the local governing body with an updated estimate of funds, and the board and the representative of the Department shall jointly prepare the list of projects to be carried out in that fiscal year taken from the six-year plan by order of priority and following generally the policies of the Board in regard to the statewide improvements to the secondary state highway system. In any year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $100,000, such list of priorities shall then be presented at a public hearing duly advertised in accordance with the procedure outlined in this section, and comments of citizens shall be obtained and considered. Following this public hearing, the board, with the concurrence of the representative of the Department, shall adopt, as official, a priority program for the ensuing year, and the Department shall include such listed projects in its secondary highways budget for the county for that year.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least once every two years following the adoption of the original six-year plan, the governing body of each county, together with the representative of the Department, may update the six-year plan of the county by adding to it and extending it as necessary so as to maintain it as a plan encompassing six years. Whenever additional funds for secondary highway purposes become available, the local governing body may request a revision in its six-year plan in order that such plan be amended to provide for the expenditure of the additional funds. Such additions and extensions to each six-year plan shall be prepared in the same manner and following the same procedures as outlined herein for its initial preparation. Where the local governing body and the representative of the Department fail to agree upon a priority program, the local governing body may appeal to the Commissioner of Highways. The Commissioner of Highways shall consider all proposed priorities and render a decision establishing a priority program based upon a consideration by the Commissioner of Highways of the welfare and safety of county citizens. Such decision shall be binding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall preclude a local governing body, with the concurrence of the representative of the Department, from combining the public hearing that may be required pursuant to this section for revision of a six-year plan with the public hearing that may be required pursuant to this section for review of the list of priorities, provided that notice of such combined hearing is published in accordance with procedures provided in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such six-year plans shall consider all existing highways in the secondary state highway system, including those in the towns located in the county that are maintained as a part of the secondary state highway system, and shall be made a public document.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any county cancels any highway construction or improvement project included in its six-year plan after the location and design for the project has been approved, such county shall reimburse the Department the net amount of all funds expended by the Department for planning, engineering, right-of-way acquisition, demolition, relocation, and construction between the date on which project development was initiated and the date of cancellation. To the extent that funds from secondary highway allocations have been expended to pay for a highway construction or improvement project, all revenues generated from a reimbursement by the county shall be deposited into that same county's secondary highway allocation. The Commissioner of Highways may waive all or any portion of such reimbursement at his discretion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not apply in instances where less than 100 percent of the right-of-way is available for donation for unpaved highway improvements.

        Subdivision ordinance requirements.
       </b>
       - Department of Transportation is authorized to prohibit a county from participating in its rural addition program when such county's subdivision ordinance does not require that all subdivision streets meet the standards that qualify roads for acceptance into the secondary system of state highways. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Martin M. McMahon, Montgomery County Attorney, 05-057 (9/6/05).

        Developer with speculative interest.
       </b>
       - Even though a landowner appears to be a developer with a speculative interest as contemplated by this section for the assessment by localities of a portion of the cost of bringing roadway to the standards required for inclusion in the state secondary highway system, the governing body of the county must obtain written declarations from the owners of at least seventy-five percent of the platted parcels of land abutting upon the street stating their acquiescence in such assessments as required by subdivision F 1. The issue of whether a landowner is a developer is a question of fact. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. C. Dean Foster, Jr., Scott County Attorney, 05-079 (1/4/06).

        Effect of covenant is a question of fact.
       </b>
       - Section 33.1-72.1 provides the requirements and funding options to improve a road to be taken into the secondary system of highways by the Virginia Department of Transportation.
       Whether the covenant would be an impediment to acceptance into the secondary system of state highways requires a determination of fact that is beyond the scope of this opinion. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Phillip P. Puckett, Member, Senate of Virginia, 12-115, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 66 (8/2/13).

          The Commissioner of Highways shall implement a program of the HOV facilities in the Hampton Roads Planning District beginning not later than May 1, 2000. This program shall include the temporary lifting of HOV restrictions and the opening of HOV lanes to all traffic when an incident resulting from nonrecurring causes within the general lanes occurs such that a lane of traffic is blocked or is expected to be blocked for 10 minutes or longer. The HOV restrictions for the facility shall be reinstated when the general lane is no longer blocked and is available for use.

       - Appropriate signage must, at a minimum, warn drivers that the road they are about to enter is all lanes high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) during certain hours; given that the vast majority of HOV roads are one lane in each direction, and the highways are frequented by drivers from all over the United States and elsewhere, a sign that does not clearly warn drivers that the road ahead is all lanes HOV during the pertinent hours cannot be the predicate for finding a defendant guilty.

       Highway signs and markings provide notice to the public as to the rules, restrictions, and regulations that every motorist is expected to follow; it follows that an individual cannot be found guilty of a traffic offense if the sign that the offense is predicated upon is not properly posted or appropriately marked.

       Requirements that high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes be appropriately marked and its restrictions properly posted are conditions precedent to finding a defendant guilty; both of these requirements appear prior to the violation provisions of the statute and mandate that the board must establish the appropriate markings in HOV lanes in order for those lanes to be reserved during periods designated by the Commonwealth Transportation Board for the exclusive use of buses and high-occupancy vehicles.

        Federal preemption.
       </b>
       - Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, cl. 2, did not preempt Virginia from regulating the use of autocycles in the HOV lane where the federal government had neither explicitly stated that the classification of autocycle was prohibited by federal law nor legislated comprehensively regarding the ability of states to place greater limitations on HOV lanes. Moreover, although there were federal laws that define motorcycle, those laws were not enough to show that Congress had a clear intent to preempt state law. Commonwealth v. Stephens, 103 Va.

       - Defendant did not commit a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) violation because the markings and signs at an exit were inappropriate; the signage could not serve as fair warning to a driver that the roadway was all lanes HOV because a solo driver who viewed the signs on the highway during the pertinent HOV hours was already in violation of the HOV restrictions.

The Circuit Court of Lancaster may have the contract for keeping the same let to the lowest bidder for a period of five years, and the bonds thereby directed shall be to the County of Lancaster. Furthermore, the ferry shall cross from Merry Point to the upper side of the wharf and canning factory at Ottoman wharf. However, the circuit court of the county shall have the right, upon the application of the board of supervisors, to discontinue the ferry if it appears that public necessity therefor no longer exists. No such application shall be made unless and until notice is given by (i) publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in the county or having general circulation therein and (ii) posting copies of the notice at the front door of the courthouse of the county and at both landings of the ferry. Such notice shall be posted and the first newspaper publication made at least 30 days before the day on which the application will be made to the court.

        Test in distinguishing public from private road.
       </b>
       - Whether a road sought to be established is a public highway or one merely for the benefit of private individuals is not tested by the fact that such individuals receive a greater benefit than the public generally. The test is not simply how many actually use the road, but how many have a free and unrestricted right in common to use it. If it is free and common to all the citizens, it is a public road.

In any such case the highway shall not be opened and established or altered until such compensation and damages and costs has been first paid or the written consent of the proprietor or tenant has been given.

     <p>
      As used in this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning:
     </p>
     <p>
      "Abandonment"
    means that the public's right to use a public highway, public landing, or public crossing has been extinguished.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Discontinuance"
    means that the Board has determined that a highway, landing, or crossing no longer serves the public convenience warranting its maintenance at public expense; it divests the Department from maintenance responsibilities. Discontinuance does not render a highway, landing, or crossing unavailable for public use.

        Meaning and effect of discontinuance.
       </b>
       - Discontinuance of a secondary road means merely that it is removed from the state secondary road system. Discontinuance of a road is a determination only that it no longer serves public convenience warranting its maintenance at public expense. The effect of discontinuance upon a road is not to eliminate it as a public road or to render it unavailable for public use. Ord v. Fugate,

       - The term "necessary" has a distinct meaning in the context of statutes and judicial decisions concerning the use of public roads. When applied to a public road, necessary is used in the statutes and judicial decisions, not in the sense of being absolutely indispensable to communications between two points, but with relation to the purposes for which public highways are established, namely, the reasonable accommodation of the traveling public.

       - Where uncontroverted evidence was that the road leads to a place of scenic beauty, 17 town residents provided extensive evidence that they and other residents of the town regularly use the road for sightseeing purposes, evidence showed that town residents use the road to view a variety of wildlife including cranes, beavers, bald eagles, deer and blue herons, and town residents testified that they enjoyed bringing guests to see the beautiful view and that they considered this view to be an asset of the community, testimony was sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that there was a public necessity, that is, a reasonable accommodation of the public, which would be served by allowing the road to continue in use.

       - The language of this section is mandatory. It provides that, on appeal from the action of the board, the circuit court "shall hear the matter de novo."

When this issue was presented and supported by substantial evidence it was the duty of the trial court to make the board of supervisors a party to the proceedings and to enter such order or orders as may have been necessary to afford defendants a reasonable and convenient means of ingress and egress from a public highway to their land, as directed by the statute.

       As the General Assembly made no provision for an appeal to any court, from the resolution of the county board of supervisors making such a finding that a new road will "serve the same citizens as the old road," it must be assumed that courts were not intended to review such findings in the absence of fraud or manifest abuse of discretion.

        Abandonment of bridge.
       </b>
       - The county may abandon a bridge that is neither in the State Highway System nor the secondary highway system if the bridge is no longer necessary or if abandonment would serve the public interest. Upon such abandonment, the bridge's ownership normally will revert to the owner of the underlying fee, if any such owner exists. If the county owns the fee, it lawfully may convey the bridge property to a private party in exchange for consideration by either a public or private sale, and, such consideration may include the county's making of a monetary payment to the purchaser. Whether the county would retain liability following its abandonment of a bridge needing repair or replacement would depend on specific facts existing at the time of occurrence of injury or damage.

Such appeal shall be filed by petition in the clerk's office of such court, setting out the action or inaction appealed from and the grounds for appeal. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the circuit court shall docket the appeal, giving it a preferred status, and if the appeal is by any of the landowners who filed a petition with the governing body for a public hearing, notice of such appeal shall be served upon the attorney for the Commonwealth and the governing body. No such appeal shall be tried by the court within 10 days after notice is given as provided in this section unless such notice is waived. The circuit court shall hear the matter de novo with further right of appeal as provided by law. The court may appoint viewers to make such investigation and findings as the court requires of them. Upon the hearing of the appeal, the court shall ascertain and by its order determine whether public necessity exists for the continuance of the section of road or the railroad crossing as a public road or public railroad crossing or whether the welfare of the public will be served best by abandoning the section of the road or the railroad crossing as a public road or public railroad crossing and shall enter its order accordingly.

       Abandonment of bridge.
      </b>
      - The county may abandon a bridge that is neither in the State Highway System nor the secondary highway system if the bridge is no longer necessary or if abandonment would serve the public interest. Upon such abandonment, the bridge's ownership normally will revert to the owner of the underlying fee, if any such owner exists. If the county owns the fee, it lawfully may convey the bridge property to a private party in exchange for consideration by either a public or private sale, and, such consideration may include the county's making of a monetary payment to the purchaser. Whether the county would retain liability following its abandonment of a bridge needing repair or replacement would depend on specific facts existing at the time of occurrence of injury or damage. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Phillip P. Puckett, Member, Senate of Virginia, 12-114, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 67 (8/2/13) (decided under prior law).

        Complaint for declaratory judgment was timely demand for reconveyance.
       </b>
       - 1999 inquiry by a successor corporation's president about reconveyance of property conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia by a predecessor corporation under a former version of this section was not timely under the 90-day requirement as it was then in effect, and the Virginia Transportation Commissioner was statutorily entitled to refuse it, but when the Commissioner offered the property for public sale in 2004, the alternative procedure then in effect for exercising the right to demand reconveyance became operative; publication of the notice of intent to sell triggered a 30-day time period in which the successor could demand reconveyance, and a declaratory judgment action filed by the successor within that time period constituted substantial compliance with the requirement for a written demand.

     <p>
      At any time after the recordation of such certificate, but prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings, if the Commissioner of Highways and the owner of the land or interest therein taken or damaged are able to agree as to compensation for the land taken and damages, if any, caused by such taking, the Commissioner of Highways shall file with the court a petition so stating, with a copy of the agreement attached. If condemnation proceedings are already pending at the time of reaching such agreement, no such petition shall be required, but the motion for dismissal of such proceedings shall contain an averment that such agreement has been reached. Upon the filing of such petition or motion to dismiss, the court shall thereupon enter an order confirming absolute and indefeasible title to the land or interest therein in the Commonwealth. Such order shall be recorded in the current deed book. Upon entry of such order, the Commissioner of Highways and State Treasurer shall be relieved of further obligation by virtue of having filed such certificate of deposit with the court.

      If it shall appear from such petition and agreement, or motion to dismiss a pending suit, that no person other than those executing such agreement are entitled to the fund on deposit, the court shall direct that such fund, after payment therefrom of any taxes that may be charged against such land taken, be disbursed and distributed in accordance with the statement or charge in the petition or motion among the parties or persons entitled thereto.

       - Where general contractor, who entered into a contract with State to construct portions of an interstate highway, asserted a claim that its subcontractor incurred additional work not anticipated by general contractor in its contract with State, the circuit judge erred in finding that general contractor was not the proper party to assert the claim; general contractor had filed suit in its own behalf and specifically alleged that it was damaged as a result of State's conduct.

       - While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the surety's motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity regarding the surety's equitable subrogation claim.

        Failure to comply with written notice requirement.
       </b>
       - Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) was not prejudiced by a contractor's failure to file a written claim telling VDOT exactly what it already knew. It would violate every principle of fair dealing for VDOT to receive actual notice of the contractor's intent to file a claim against it, commence an adversarial course of dealing with the contractor anticipating litigation, and then turn around and say that the contractor's claim failed due to a fatal technical omission in its notice.

        §
       </span>
       33.1-386 when interpreting the statute, but could look to other sections of the Code of Virginia for guidance where similar language was employed. The court adhered to the sound logic Virginia courts adopted when interpreting the notice requirements in statutes concerning contract and tort suits against governmental entities, the Medical Malpractice Act, the Workers' Compensation Act, and the zoning statute; in so doing, the court deferred to the broad, deep-seated principle underpinning those statutes that legal form had to yield to the interests of legal function.

       <span class="s1">

       33.1-386; however, the contractor's actual notice served as an official indication to VDOT of the contractor's opposing contract interpretations and alerted VDOT of the contractor's claims, thus giving VDOT the opportunity to take appropriate remedial measures. The contractor's claim should not be dismissed since the public policy function of the written notice provision was achieved through actual notice; form failed to trump function.

        Actual notice was a valid substitute for written notice.
       </b>
       - Because form did not prevail over substance, a contractor's actual notice was a valid substitute for written notice since it effectively accomplished the purpose of the written notice requirement; the contractor's actual notice put VDOT on notice of its claims against VDOT, that it allowed VDOT to investigate the alleged claims, and that it enabled VDOT to reach an initial determination on the merits of said claims.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that there exists in the Commonwealth a critical need for additional sources of funding to finance the present and future needs of the Commonwealth for the design and construction of highways, including toll facilities; mass transit; freight, passenger and commuter rail, including rolling stock; and port, airport, and other transportation facilities. This need can be alleviated in part through the creation of a transportation infrastructure bank. The purpose of such bank is to encourage the investment of both public and private funds and to make loans and other financial assistance available to localities, private entities, and other eligible borrowers to finance eligible transportation projects. The General Assembly determines that the creation of a transportation infrastructure bank for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose, and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience, or prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth.

      The bonds of such issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, and shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Board or by formula or method established by resolution of the Board, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal or purchase price of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The payments of principal and interest may be uniform in amount over the life of the bond; however, such uniformity shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance of such bonds. The Board shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board, and the official seal of the Board shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary or assistant secretary of the Board, and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board. When any officer whose signature appears on the bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. Prior to the preparation of definite bonds, the Board, under like restrictions, may issue temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Board may also provide for the replacement of any bond that is mutilated, destroyed, or lost.

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Board in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the projects and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that the project shall be acquired, or acquired and improved, or constructed, and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or designated by the Board and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the project or other moneys pertaining thereto be satisfactory to such purchasers. Any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth may act as such depository and furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Board may provide, by resolution or by such trust indenture, that after the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the project into the state treasury the Board will immediately transfer or pay same over to such officer, board, or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repairs of the project affected by such indenture.

      The projects acquired or constructed under this chapter may be policed in whole or in part by State Police officers even though all or some portions of any such projects lie within the corporate limits of a municipality or other political subdivision. Such officers shall be under the exclusive control and direction of the Superintendent of State Police and shall be responsible for the preservation of public peace, prevention of crime, apprehension of criminals, protection of the rights of persons and property, and enforcement of the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth within the limits of any such projects. All other police officers of the Commonwealth and of each locality or other political subdivision through which any project, or portion thereof, extends shall have the same powers and jurisdiction within the limits of such projects as they have beyond such limits and shall have access to the projects at any time for the purpose of exercising such powers and jurisdiction.

      The Board is authorized and empowered to employ and appoint "project guards" for the purpose of protecting the projects and to enforce the regulations of the Board, except those paralleling state law, established for the use of such projects. Such guards may issue summons to appear or arrest on view without warrant and conduct before the nearest officer authorized by law to admit to bail any persons violating, within or upon the projects, any such rule or regulation. The provisions of §§ 46.2-936 and 46.2-940 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the issuance of summons or arrests without warrants pursuant to this section.

      The violation of any regulation adopted by the Board pursuant to the authority hereby granted shall be punishable as follows: If such violation would have been a violation of law if committed on any public street or highway in the county, city, or town in which such violation occurred, it shall be punishable in the same manner as if it had been committed on such public road, street, or highway; otherwise it shall be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor.

      The powers and duties of the Board enumerated in this chapter shall not be construed as a limitation of the general powers or duties of the Board. The Board, in addition to the powers and duties enumerated in this chapter, shall do and perform any and all things and acts necessary in the construction or acquisition, maintenance, and operation of any project to be constructed or acquired under the provisions of this chapter, to the end that such project may become and be operated free of tolls as early as possible and practicable, subject only to the express limitations of this chapter and the limitations of other laws and constitutional provisions applicable thereto.

        Operation of bus facilities.

      <p>
       The Commonwealth has the power to operate a bus facility across the Hampton Roads bridge-tunnel project and the fact that a certificate to transport passengers across the project had been issued by the Corporation Commission to a common carrier could affect only the wisdom of the state's action in so doing, not its authority.

        Commission (now Board) may "acquire" facilities by purchase, by lease or by contracting with private enterprise.
       </b>
       - The word "acquire" as used in the provision of this section authorizing the Commission (now Board) to acquire and operate bus facilities does not denote ownership alone. This word not only has the meaning to obtain as one's own, but also has the meaning of "procure." The Commission has the right to "acquire such bus facilities" by purchase, by lease, or by contracting with private enterprise to provide the desired services as its agent. Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis,
       <cite class="va_code">

      <p>
       <b>
        Duty to provide facilities is discretionary.
       </b>
       - The duty to acquire and operate bus facilities is a discretionary duty to be performed and not a clearly defined ministerial one imposed upon the Highway Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board). Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis,
       <cite class="va_code">
        200 Va. 147

       The Commission (now Board) also has the right not to provide any bus facilities. Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis,
       <cite class="va_code">
        200 Va. 147

        And such discretion cannot be controlled or reviewed by mandamus.

       - Since, where an officer or board is vested with discretion, such discretion cannot be controlled or reviewed by mandamus, mandamus would not lie at the instance of the holder of the only certificate issued by the Corporation Commission to operate bus facilities over the Hampton Roads tunnel project, to compel the State Highway Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board) to terminate a contract awarded by it to another bus company to furnish exclusive service across the project, and to allow petitioner to supply such service under its certificate.

Such responsible public entity shall not be required to select the proposal with the lowest price offer, but may consider price as one factor in evaluating the proposals received. Other factors that may be considered include (i) the proposed cost of the qualifying transportation facility; (ii) the general reputation, qualifications, industry experience, and financial capacity of the private entity; (iii) the proposed design, operation, and feasibility of the qualifying transportation facility; (iv) the eligibility of the facility for priority selection, review, and documentation timelines under the responsible public entity's guidelines; (v) local citizen and public entity comments; (vi) benefits to the public; (vii) the private entity's compliance with a minority business enterprise participation plan or good faith effort to comply with the goals of such plan; (viii) the private entity's plans to employ local contractors and residents; (ix) the safety record of the private entity; (x) the ability of the facility to address the needs identified in the appropriate state, regional or local transportation plan by improving safety, reducing congestion, increasing capacity, enhancing economic efficiency, or any combination thereof; and (xi) other criteria that the responsible public entity deems appropriate.

When the responsible public entity determines to proceed according to the guidelines adopted by it pursuant to this subdivision, it shall state the reasons for its determination in writing. If a state agency is the responsible public entity, the approval of the Secretary shall be required as more specifically set forth in the guidelines before the comprehensive agreement is signed.

        Each signatory state to the Compact shall establish a compact commission. In Virginia, the Interstate 73 Transportation Compact Commission (the Commission) shall be established as a regional instrumentality and common agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the signatory states. The compact commissions of each signatory state shall be empowered to carry out the purposes of its respective Compact.

        The chairman of the Commission shall be elected by the members of the Commission from among its membership. The chairman shall serve for a term of one year, and the chairmanship shall rotate among the signatory states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commission shall meet not less than twice annually; however, the Commission shall not meet more than once annually in the same state. The Commission shall issue an annual report of its activities to the governor and legislature of each signatory state.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to carry out the purposes of the Compact, the Commission shall be authorized to or may authorize a private entity to fix and revise a schedule of toll rates and to collect such tolls to provide for the design, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, operation, and maintenance of any Interstate 73 transportation project undertaken by the signatory states in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and as approved by the Commission and the legislature of the signatory state in which such toll is to be collected.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commission may utilize for its operation and expenses funds appropriated to it for such purposes by the General Assembly of Virginia and the legislatures of the other signatory states, federal funds, and revenues collected for the use of any project approved by the Commission.

       <p>
        Legislative members of the Virginia delegation to the Commission shall receive such compensation as provided in § 30-19.12 of the Code of Virginia and shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties to the Commission as provided in §§ 2.2-2813 and 2.2-2825 of the Code of Virginia. However, all such compensation and expenses shall be paid from existing appropriations, federal funds, or other revenues collected for the use of any project approved by the Commission.

       <p>
        The Compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each state enacting it until the legislature or the governor of such state withdraws therefrom by giving written notice to the other parties. Such action shall be effective six months after notice thereof has been sent by the legislature or the governor of the state desiring to withdraw to the governor of all states then parties to the Compact.

     <p>
      The development of transportation systems, composed of transit facilities, public highways, and other modes of transport, is necessary for the orderly growth and development of the urban areas of the Commonwealth; for the safety, comfort, and convenience of its citizens; and for the economical utilization of public funds. The provision of the necessary facilities and services cannot be achieved by the unilateral action of the counties and cities, and the attainment thereof requires planning and action on a regional basis, conducted cooperatively and on a continuing basis, between representatives of the affected political subdivisions and the Commonwealth Transportation Board. In those urban areas of the Commonwealth that together form a single metropolitan area, solutions must be jointly sought with the affected political subdivisions and highway departments. Such joint action should be conducted in a manner that preserves, to the extent the necessity for joint action permits, local autonomy over patterns of growth and development of each participating political subdivision or locality. The requisite joint action may best be achieved through the device of a transportation district, having the powers, functions, and duties set forth in this chapter. In the provision of improved or expanded transit facilities, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to make use of private enterprise to the extent reasonably practicable.

The enabling legislation, like that of these other authorities vested with the power to incur bonded indebtedness, affirms that debt so incurred is that of the entity, not of the Commonwealth or of any other political subdivision. This statement was repeated in bonds themselves, as well as in other documents constituting financing proposal. The debt incurred by legislatively created, independent political subdivisions, whatever their title, is not the debt of the Commonwealth or of any other governmental unit.

     <p>
      Within 30 days after the establishment of a district under this chapter, the local governing body from each locality within which any portion of the district is located shall appoint six members to a district advisory board. Three of the six members from each locality shall be chosen by the local governing body from nominations submitted to the local governing body by the petitioners. All members shall own or represent commercially or industrially zoned property within the district. Each member shall be appointed for a term of four years, except the initial appointment of advisory board members shall provide that the terms of three of the members shall be for two years. If a vacancy occurs with respect to an advisory board member initially appointed by a local governing body, or any successor of such a member, the local governing body shall appoint a new member who is a representative or owner of commercially or industrially zoned property within the local district. If a vacancy occurs with respect to an advisory board member initially nominated by the petitioners, or any successor thereof, the remaining advisory board members initially nominated by the petitioners, or their successors, shall nominate a new member for selection by the local governing body.

      District advisory board members shall serve without pay, but the local governing body shall provide the advisory board with facilities for the holding of meetings, and the commission shall appropriate funds needed to defray the reasonable expenses and fees of the advisory board that shall not exceed $20,000 annually, including expenses and fees arising out of the preparation of the annual report. Such appropriations shall be based on an annual budget submitted by the board, and approved by the commission, sufficient to carry out its responsibilities under this chapter. The advisory board shall elect a chairman and a secretary and such other officers as it deems necessary. The advisory board shall fix the time for holding regular meetings, but it shall meet at least once every year. Special meetings of the advisory board shall be called by the chairman or by two members of the advisory board upon written request to the secretary of the advisory board. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum.
     </p>
     <p>
      The advisory board shall present an annual report to the commission on the transportation needs of the district and on the activities of the advisory board, and the advisory board shall present special reports on transportation matters as requested by the commission or the local governing body concerning taxes to be levied pursuant to this chapter.

If, however, a deficit remains after any rezoning and adjustment of the tax rate or the rate is at the maximum authorized rate and cannot be increased, then the amount of funds otherwise appropriated and allocated, pursuant to the highway allocation formula as provided by law, to the highway construction district in which the project covered by such contract is located or to such county or counties in which such project is located shall be reduced by the amount of such deficit and used to satisfy the deficit.

       § 33.2-2105. Annual special improvements tax; use of revenues.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the written request of the commission made to the governing body, the governing body may levy and collect an annual special improvements tax on taxable real estate zoned for commercial or industrial use or used for such purposes and taxable leasehold interests in that portion of the improvement district within its jurisdiction. For the purposes of this chapter, real property that is zoned to permit multiunit residential use but not yet used for that purpose and multiunit residential real property that is primarily leased or rented to residential tenants or other occupants by an owner who is engaged in such a business shall be deemed to be property in commercial use and therefore subject to the special improvements tax authorized by this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 (§

      et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1, the tax shall be levied on the assessed fair market value of the taxable real property. The rate of the special improvements tax shall not be more than 40 cents ($0.40) per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by §

      ; however, if all the owners in any district so request in writing, this limitation on rate shall not apply. Such special improvements taxes shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the county's taxes are collected, and the proceeds shall be kept in a separate account. The effective date of the initial levy shall be, at the discretion of the governing body, either (i) January 1 of the year following adoption of the resolution creating the district or (ii) on a prorated basis for the period from the date when the special improvements tax was first imposed through the remainder of the year. All revenues received by the county pursuant to such taxes shall be paid to or at the direction of the district commission for its use pursuant to this chapter. All revenues generated from the annual special improvements taxes levied by the governing body pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be contributions of that governing body in any transportation cost-sharing formula.

      The Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire by purchase, whenever it deems such purchase expedient, solely from funds provided under the authority of this chapter, such lands, structures, rights-of-way, property, rights, franchises, easements, and other interests in lands, including lands lying under water and riparian rights, that are located within the Commonwealth as it may deem necessary or convenient for the construction and operation of the project, upon such terms and at such prices as may be considered by it to be reasonable and can be agreed upon between it and the owner thereof, and to take title thereto in the name of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      All localities and political subdivisions and all public agencies and commissions of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, are hereby authorized and empowered to lease, lend, grant, or convey to the District at the Commission's request upon such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of such localities, political subdivisions, agencies, or commissions of the Commonwealth may deem reasonable and fair and without the necessity for any advertisement, order of court, or other action or formality, other than the regular and formal action of the authorities concerned, any real property that may be necessary or convenient to the effectuation of the authorized purposes of the Commission, including public highways and other real property already devoted to public use.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, or whenever the owner is legally incapacitated or is absent, unknown, or unable to convey valid title, the Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire by condemnation or by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any lands, property, rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements, and other property, including public lands, parks, playgrounds, reservations, highways, or parkways, or parts thereof or rights therein, of any person, partnership, association, railroad, public service, public utility or other corporation, municipality, or political subdivision deemed necessary or convenient for the construction or the efficient operation of the project or necessary in the restoration of public or private property damaged or destroyed. Such proceedings shall be in accordance with and subject to the provisions of any and all laws applicable to condemnation of property in the name of the Commissioner of Highways under the laws of the Commonwealth. Title to any property acquired by the Commission shall be taken in the name of the District. In any condemnation proceedings, the court having jurisdiction of the suit, action, or proceeding may make such orders as may be just to the Commission and to the owners of the property to be condemned and may require an undertaking or other security to secure such owners against any loss or damage by reason of the failure of the Commission to accept and pay for the property, but neither such undertaking or security nor any act or obligation of the Commission shall impose any liability upon the District except as may be paid from the funds provided under the authority of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the owner, lessee, or occupier of any property to be condemned refuses to remove his personal property therefrom or give up possession thereof, the Commission may proceed to obtain possession in any manner provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to any railroad property or right-of-way upon which railroad tracks are located, any powers of condemnation or of eminent domain may be exercised to acquire only an easement interest therein, which is located either sufficiently far above or sufficiently far below the grade of any railroad track upon such railroad property so that neither the proposed project nor any part thereof, including any bridges, abutments, columns, supporting structures, and appurtenances, nor any traffic upon it interferes in any manner with the use, operation, or maintenance of the trains, tracks, works, or appurtenances or other property of the railroad nor endanger the movement of the trains or traffic upon the tracks of the railroad. Prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings for such easement over or under such railroad property or right-of-way, plans and specifications of the proposed project showing compliance with the above-mentioned above or below grade requirements and showing sufficient and safe plans and specifications of such overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be submitted to the railroad for examination and approval. If the railroad fails or refuses within 30 days to approve the plans and specifications so submitted, the matter shall be submitted to the State Corporation Commission, as to the sufficiency and safety of such plans and specifications and as to such elevations or distances above or below the tracks. Said overhead or undergrade structure and appurtenances shall be constructed only in accordance with such plans and specifications and in accordance with such elevations or distances above or below the tracks so approved by the railroad or the State Corporation Commission. A copy of the plans and specifications approved by the railroad or the State Corporation Commission shall be filed as an exhibit with the petition for condemnation. The cost of any such overhead or undergrade projects and appurtenances and any expense and cost incurred in changing, adjusting, relocating, or removing the lines and grades of such railroad in connection with the project shall be paid by the Commission as a part of the cost of the project.

     <p>
      The Commission is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds of the District for any one or more of the following purposes: (i) paying all or a part of the cost of all or a part of the project and (ii) refunding any outstanding revenue bonds of the District that have been issued under the provisions of this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of such bonds. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate not exceeding six percent per year payable semiannually, shall mature at such time, not exceeding 40 years from their date, as may be determined by the Commission, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Commission, at such price and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Commission prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The Commission shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside of the Commonwealth. If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, his signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Commission may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. The Commission may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the District, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per year computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computations the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be disbursed for the purposes for which such bonds shall have been issued under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture provided for in this chapter. If the bonds of a particular issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, are less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the funds hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Commission may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The Commission may also provide for the replacement of any bond that becomes mutilated or that has been destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than the proceedings, conditions, and things that are specified and required by this chapter.

Such trust indenture or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Such trust indenture or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Commission in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project in connection with which such bonds have been authorized, the rates of toll to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth that may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Commission. Any such trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust indenture or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the project.

Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any other commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth. The tolls and all other revenues derived from the project in connection with which the bonds of any issue have been issued, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture in a sinking fund that is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the tolls or other revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Commission shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Commission, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.

      In addition to such other powers vested in the Authority by this chapter, the Authority shall have the following powers and functions:

     <ol>
      <li id="t33.2sIVc25s33.2-2500ol11">

      </li>
      <li id="t33.2sIVc25s33.2-2500ol12">
       The Authority shall evaluate all significant transportation projects, including highway, mass transit, and technology projects, in and near Planning District 8, to the extent that funds are available for such purpose. The evaluation shall provide an objective, quantitative rating for each project according to the degree to which the project is expected to reduce congestion and, to the extent feasible, the degree to which the project is expected to improve regional mobility in the event of a homeland security emergency. Such evaluation shall rely on analytical techniques and transportation modeling, including those that employ computer simulations currently and customarily employed in transportation planning. The Authority may rely on the results of transportation modeling performed by other entities, including the Department of Transportation and private entities contracted for this purpose, provided that such modeling is in accordance with this section. The Authority shall publicize the quantitative ratings determined for each project on its website and complete the evaluation at least once every four years, with interim progress reports provided on the website at least once every six months.
       
        For purposes of this section, the significant transportation projects to be evaluated may include:

Such contracts or agreements, together with any agreements or leases for the operation of such facilities, may be used by the Authority to finance the construction and operation of transportation facilities and such contracts, agreements, or leases shall inure to the benefit of any creditor of the Authority.
       <p>
        Notwithstanding subdivisions 1 through 5, the Authority shall not have the power to regulate services provided by taxicabs, either within municipalities or across municipal boundaries; such regulation is expressly reserved to the municipalities within which taxicabs operate.

In carrying out this responsibility, the Authority shall, on the basis of a regional consensus whenever possible, set regional transportation policies and priorities for regional transportation projects and, at least once every five years, shall consider for revision and revise as necessary the regional transportation plan. The policies and priorities shall have reducing congestion in Planning District 8 as their primary objective to the greatest extent practicable and shall be guided by performance-based criteria such as the ability to improve travel times, reduce delays, connect regional activity centers, improve safety, improve air quality, and move the most people in the most cost-effective manner. Any obstacles to achieving this objective shall be specified in writing, including any reason relating to the need for cooperation by any locality embraced by (i) the Authority, (ii) the District of Columbia, (iii) the State of Maryland, or (iv) any other regional entity in the metropolitan Washington area.

       Editor's note.
      </b>
      - At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the third paragraph was added, because it had been inadvertently dropped in the drafting stage during the 2020 session.
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 8 provides: "That the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority and the counties and cities embraced by the Authority shall work cooperatively with towns with a population greater than 3,500 located within such counties for purposes of implementing the provisions of this act and to ensure that such towns receive their respective share of the revenues pursuant to subdivision B 1 of Section 15.2-4838.1."
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 9 provides: "That the Texas Transportation Institute's annual report on highway congestion ranks the Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C. area as the worst area for traffic congestion in the nation, and the Hampton Roads region as the twentieth most congested area of the 101 areas studies. Such congestion has an average commuter cost of nearly $1,400 in Northern Virginia and $877 per commuter in Hampton Roads. Such congestion negatively impacts Virginia's economic prosperity, strategic military connectivity, emergency preparedness, and environmental quality. Regions with populations in excess of 1.5 million citizens and 1.2 million registered vehicles are prone to greater levels of congestion and growing transit needs. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that transportation construction and maintenance in the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads regions are high priorities, and that as other regions of the Commonwealth continue to grow, the same priority shall be given."
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 10 provides: "That each county or city located in Planning District 8 or Planning District 23 as of January 1, 2013, shall expend or disburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state grants, between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2013. Each county or city located in any other Planning District that becomes subject to the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act shall expend or disburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state grants, during the 36-month period immediately prior to the effective date of the imposition of such state taxes or fees in the Planning District. In the event that any such county or city does not expend or disburse such an amount, that county or city shall not be the direct beneficiary of any of the revenues generated by the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act in the immediately succeeding year."
     </p>
     <p>
      Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 11 provides: "That no tolls shall be imposed or collected on Interstate 95 south of Fredericksburg pursuant to the Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program without the prior approval of the General Assembly."

      Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 9 provides: "That the Texas Transportation Institute's annual report on highway congestion ranks the Northern Virginia/Washington, D.C. area as the worst area for traffic congestion in the nation, and the Hampton Roads region as the twentieth most congested area of the 101 areas studies. Such congestion has an average commuter cost of nearly $1,400 in Northern Virginia and $877 per commuter in Hampton Roads. Such congestion negatively impacts Virginia's economic prosperity, strategic military connectivity, emergency preparedness, and environmental quality. Regions with populations in excess of 1.5 million citizens and 1.2 million registered vehicles are prone to greater levels of congestion and growing transit needs. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that transportation construction and maintenance in the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads regions are high priorities, and that as other regions of the Commonwealth continue to grow, the same priority shall be given."

Each county or city located in any other Planning District that becomes subject to the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act shall expend or disburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state grants, during the 36-month period immediately prior to the effective date of the imposition of such state taxes or fees in the Planning District. In the event that any such county or city does not expend or disburse such an amount, that county or city shall not be the direct beneficiary of any of the revenues generated by the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act in the immediately succeeding year."

       The General Assembly declares it to be in the public interest that developing and continuing operations of reliable regional public transportation is important for a balanced and effective multimodal transportation system in the Hampton Roads region and is essential to the region's economic growth, vitality, and competitiveness. The General Assembly further declares that a special transportation program, to be known as the Hampton Roads Regional Transit Program (the Program), should provide for the costs of developing, maintaining, and improving a core regional network of transit routes and related infrastructure, rolling stock, and support facilities that have the greatest positive impacts on economic development potential, employment opportunities, mobility, environmental sustainability, and quality of life.

      There is hereby created a political subdivision and public body corporate and politic of the Commonwealth to be known as the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to be governed by a board of directors consisting of 16 members appointed as follows: five members to be appointed by the Board of Supervisors of Chesterfield County for terms of four years from the date of appointment; five members to be appointed by the Board of Supervisors of Henrico County for terms of four years from the date of appointment; four members to be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Richmond with the approval of the City Council of the City of Richmond (Council) for terms of four years from the date of appointment; one member of the Council appointed by the president of the Council for a term of four years from the date of appointment; and one ex officio member from the Commonwealth Transportation Board to be appointed by the Commissioner of Highways. Any of the three localities may, in its discretion, appoint as one of its Board members an elected officeholder who is a member of the governing body of that locality. Vacancies in the membership of the board of directors shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment for the unexpired portion of the term. The board of directors so appointed shall enter upon the performance of its duties and shall initially and annually elect a chairman and a vice-chairman from its membership and shall also elect annually a secretary or secretary-treasurer, who need not be a member of the board of directors. The chairman, or in his absence the vice-chairman, shall preside at all meetings of the board of directors, and in the absence of both the chairman and vice-chairman, the board of directors shall elect a chairman pro tempore who shall preside at such meetings. Nine directors shall constitute a quorum, and all action by the board of directors shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting. The members of the board of directors shall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred in attendance upon meetings of the board of directors or while otherwise engaged in the discharge of their duties, and each member shall also be paid the sum of $50 per day for each day or portion thereof during which he is engaged in the performance of his duties. Such expenses and compensation shall be paid out of the treasury of the Authority in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Authority. No member of the Board shall receive health insurance, dental insurance, retirement benefits, or other such benefits as compensation for his service on the Board.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of Authority facilities or any project or portion of such facilities. The principal of and interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the revenues pledged for such payment. The bonds of each issue or series shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding six percent per year, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 50 years from the date or dates thereof, as may be determined by the Authority, and may contain provisions reserving the right of the Authority to redeem such bonds before maturity at such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution authorizing such bonds. Such bonds may be issued in coupon form, registered form, or both as prescribed by the Authority, and provisions may be made for the registration of coupon bonds as to principal only or as to both principal and interest and for the reconversion of registered bonds into coupon bonds. Such bonds may be issued in any denomination and may be made payable at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth as the Authority may determine. Such bonds and the coupons attached to coupon bonds shall be signed in such manner either manually or by facsimile signature, as shall be determined by the Authority, and sealed with the seal of the Authority or a facsimile thereof. In case any officer whose signature or facsimile thereof shall appear on any bond or coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer or officers had remained in office until the delivery thereof. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner either at public or private sale and for such price or prices as the Authority may determine, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per year, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on the redemption of any bond prior to maturity. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond that has become mutilated, destroyed, or lost.

Such fees, tolls, rents, rates, and other charges shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth or of any municipality, county, or other political subdivision of the Commonwealth, and all revenues, when collected, and the proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, shall be held by the Authority in trust for the benefit of the holders of bonds of the Authority issued for the construction or acquisition of Authority facilities and for properly maintaining, operating, and repairing the Authority facilities.

      The Authority is hereby authorized by resolution to provide for the issuance of refunding revenue bonds with which to refund outstanding revenue bonds or any issue or series of such outstanding bonds, which refunding revenue bonds may be issued at or before the maturity or redemption date of the bonds to be refunded, and to include different issues or series of such outstanding revenue bonds by a single issue of refunding revenue bonds, and to issue refunding revenue bonds to pay any redemption premium and interest to accrue and become payable on the outstanding revenue bonds being refunded to the date of payment or redemption, and to establish reserves for such refunding revenue bonds. Such refunding revenue bonds shall be payable solely from all or that portion of the revenues of the Authority facilities pledged to the payment thereof in the bond resolution pursuant to which such bonds were issued. Such refunding revenue bonds may, in the discretion of the Authority, be exchanged at par for the revenue bonds that are being refunded or may be sold at public or private sale in such manner and at such price as the Authority shall deem for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per year, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on the redemption of any bonds prior to maturity, and may be issued and delivered at any time prior to the date of redemption or maturity date of the bonds to be refunded as the Authority determines to be in the best interests of the Authority. The interest rate or rates on refunding revenue bonds shall not be limited by the interest rate or rates borne by any of the revenue bonds to be refunded thereby. The proceeds derived from the sale of refunding revenue bonds issued under this chapter shall be invested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States government pending the application of such proceeds to the purpose for which such refunding revenue bonds have been issued. To further secure such refunding revenue bonds, the Authority may contract with the purchasers thereof with respect to the safekeeping and application of the proceeds thereof and the safekeeping and application of the earnings of such investments. The determination of the Authority with respect to the financial soundness and advantage of the issuance and delivery of refunding revenue bonds authorized under this chapter shall be conclusive, but nothing contained in this section shall require the holders of any outstanding revenue bonds being refunded to accept payment thereof otherwise than as provided in the outstanding bonds.

      In the discretion of the Authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement or indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth, to be selected by the Authority in such manner as it may elect.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth that may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such resolution, trust agreement, or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such resolution, trust agreement, or indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the Authority facilities or portion thereof.

      All or any portion of the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of Authority facilities, as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement or indenture securing such bonds, may be pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the payment shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement nor indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the Authority.

      <p>
       Whereas, Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia heretofore have entered into the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact (Virginia - Ch. 627, 1958 Acts of Assembly; Maryland - Ch. 613, Acts of General Assembly 1959; District of Columbia - Resolution of the Board of Commissioners adopted December 22, 1960), with the consent of the Congress (J.R., September 15, 1960, P.L., 86-794, 74 Stat. 1031, as amended by 76 Stat. 764), as a first step toward the improvement of transit service in the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C.;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, in said Compact each of the Signatories pledged to each of the other signatory parties faithful cooperation in the solution and control of transit and traffic problems within said metropolitan area and, in order to effect such purposes, agreed to enact any necessary legislation to achieve the objectives of the Compact to the mutual benefit of the citizens living within said metropolitan area and for the advancement of the interests of the Signatories;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, it has been established by a decade of studies that a regional system of improved and expanded transit facilities, including grade-separated rail facilities in congested areas, is essential in said metropolitan area for the satisfactory movement of people and goods, the alleviation of present and future traffic congestion, the economic welfare and vitality of all parts of the area, the effectiveness of the departments and agencies of the federal government located within the area, the orderly growth and development of the District of Columbia and the Maryland and Virginia portions of the area, the comfort and convenience of the residents of and visitors to the area, and the preservation of the beauty and dignity of the Nation's Capital;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, the Congress has authorized Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia to negotiate a Compact for the establishment of an organization empowered to provide necessary transit facilities (P.L. 86-669, 74 Stat. 537) and in said legislation declared the policy, inter alia, that the development and administration of such transit facilities requires (1) cooperation among the federal, state and local government of the area, (2) financial participation by the federal government in the creation of major facilities that are beyond the financial capacity or borrowing powers of the private carriers, the District of Columbia and the local governments of the area, and (3) coordination of transit facilities with other public facilities and with the use of land, public and private;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, private transit companies should be utilized to the extent practicable in providing the regional transit facilities and services, consistent with the requirements of the public interest that the publicly and privately owned facilities be operated as a coordinated regional system without unnecessary duplicating services;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, adequate provision should be made for the protection of transit labor in the development and operation of the regional system;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, adequate provisions should be made to eliminate any requirement of additional authentication of manual signature of bonds guaranteed by the United States of America; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, it is hereby determined that an Authority to be created by interstate compact between the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia, is the most suitable form of organization to achieve the stated objectives;
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, therefore, the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia, hereinafter referred to as Signatories, do hereby amend the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact by adding thereto Title III, as hereinafter set forth, and do hereby covenant and agree substantially, as follows:

       Board Membership
      </p>
      <p>
       5. (a) The Authority shall be governed by a Board of eight Directors consisting of two Directors for each Signatory and two for the federal government (one of whom shall be a regular passenger and customer of the bus or rail service of the Authority). For Virginia, the Directors shall be appointed by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission; for the District of Columbia by the Council of the District of Columbia; for Maryland, by the Washington Suburban Transit Commission; and for the federal government, by the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation. For Virginia and Maryland, the Directors shall be appointed from among the members of the appointing body, except as otherwise provided herein, and shall serve for a term coincident with their term on the appointing body. A Director for a Signatory may be removed or suspended from office only as provided by the law of the Signatory from which he was appointed. The nonfederal appointing authorities shall also appoint an alternate for each Director. In addition, the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation shall also appoint two nonvoting members who shall serve as the alternates for the federal Directors. An alternate Director may act only in the absence of the Director for whom he has been appointed an alternate, except that, in the case of the District of Columbia where only one Director and his alternate are present, such alternate may act on behalf of the absent Director. Each alternate, including the federal nonvoting Directors, shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority. In the event of a vacancy in the office of Director or alternate, it shall be filled in the same manner as an original appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Before entering upon the duties of his office each Director and alternate director shall take and subscribe to the following oath (or affirmation) of office or any such other oath or affirmation, if any, as the Constitution or laws of the Government he represents shall provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I, ________________________________________, hereby solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and Laws of the state or political jurisdiction from which I was appointed as a Director (alternate director) of the Board of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and will faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter."

      <p>
       Compensation of Directors and Alternates
      </p>
      <p>
       6. Members of the Board and alternates shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for necessary expenses incurred as an incident to the performance of their duties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organization and Procedure
      </p>
      <p>
       7. The Board shall provide for its own organization and procedure. It shall organize annually by the election of a Chairman and Vice-Chairman from among its members. Meetings of the Board shall be held as frequently as the Board deems that the proper performance of its duties requires and the Board shall keep minutes of its meetings. The Board shall adopt rules and regulations governing its meeting, minutes and transactions.

      <p>
       8. (a) Four Directors or alternates consisting of at least one Director or alternate appointed from each Signatory, shall constitute a quorum and no action by the Board shall be effective unless a majority of the Board present and voting, which majority shall include at least one Director or alternate from each Signatory, concur therein; provided, however, that a plan of financing may be adopted or a mass transit plan adopted, altered, revised or amended by the unanimous vote of the Directors representing any two Signatories.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) The actions of the Board shall be expressed by motion or resolution. Actions dealing solely with internal management of the Authority shall become effective when directed by the Board, but no other action shall become effective prior to the expiration of thirty days following its adoption; provided, however, that the Board may provide for the acceleration of any action upon a finding that such acceleration is required for the proper and timely performance of its functions.

       9. (a) The officers of the Authority, none of whom shall be members of the Board, shall consist of a general manager, a secretary, a treasurer, a comptroller, an inspector general, and a general counsel and such other officers as the Board may provide. Except for the office of general manager, inspector general, and comptroller, the Board may consolidate any of such other offices in one person. All such officers shall be appointed and may be removed by the Board, shall serve at the pleasure of the Board and shall perform such duties and functions as the Board shall specify. The Board shall fix and determine the compensation to be paid to all officers and, except for the general manager who shall be a full-time employee, all other officers may be hired on a full-time or part-time basis and may be compensated on a salary or fee basis, as the Board may determine.

      </p>
      <p>
       (d) The inspector general shall report to the Board and head the Office of the Inspector General, an independent and objective unit of the Authority that conducts and supervises audits, program evaluations, and investigations relating to Authority activities; promotes economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in Authority activities; detects and prevents fraud and abuse in Authority activities; and keeps the Board fully and currently informed about deficiencies in Authority activities as well as the necessity for and progress of corrective action.

      <p>
       13. (a) The Board shall develop and adopt, and may from time to time review and revise, a mass transit plan for the immediate and long-range needs of the Zone. The mass transit plan shall include one or more plans designating (1) the transit facilities to be provided by the Authority, including the locations of terminals, stations, platforms, parking facilities and the character and nature thereof; (2) the design and location of such facilities; (3) whether such facilities are to be constructed or acquired by lease, purchase or condemnation; (4) a timetable for the provision of such facilities; (5) the anticipated capital cost; (6) estimated operating expenses and revenues relating thereto; and (7) the various other factors and considerations, which, in the opinion of the Board, justify and require the projects therein proposed. Such plan shall specify the type of equipment to be utilized, the areas to be served, the routes and schedules of service expected to be provided and probable fares and charges therefor.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) In preparing the mass transit plan, and in any review or revision thereof, the Board shall make full utilization of all data, studies, reports and information available from the National Capital Transportation Agency and from any other agencies of the federal government, and from Signatories and the political subdivisions thereof.

      <p>
       Policy
      </p>
      <p>
       16. With due regard for the policy of Congress for financing a mass transit plan for the Zone set forth in Section 204 (g) of the National Capital Transportation Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 537), it is hereby declared to be the policy of this Title that, as far as possible, the payment of all costs shall be borne by the persons using or benefiting from the Authority's facilities and services and any remaining costs shall be equitably shared among the federal, District of Columbia and participating local governments in the Zone. The allocation among such governments of such remaining cost shall be determined by agreement among them and shall be provided in the manner hereinafter specified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plan of Financing
      </p>
      <p>
       17. (a) The Authority, in conformance with said policy, shall prepare and adopt a plan for financing the construction, acquisition and operation of facilities specified in a mass transit plan adopted pursuant to Article VI hereof, or in any alteration, revision or amendment thereof. Such plan of financing shall specify the facilities to be constructed or acquired, the cost thereof, the principal amount of revenue bonds, equipment trust certificates and other evidences of debt proposed to be issued, the principal terms and provisions of all loans and underlying agreements and indentures, estimated operating expenses and revenues and the proposed allocation among the federal, District of Columbia and participating local governments of the remaining costs and deficits, if any, and such other information as the Commission may consider appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Such plan of financing shall constitute a proposal to the interested governments for financial participation and shall not impose any obligation on any government and such obligations shall be created only as provided in § 18 of this Article VII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commitments for Financial Participation
      </p>
      <p>
       18. (a) Commitments on behalf of the portion of the Zone located in Virginia shall be by contract or agreement by the Authority with the Northern Virginia Transportation District, or its component governments, as authorized in the Transportation District Act of 1964 (Ch. 631, 1964 Virginia Acts of Assembly), to contribute to the capital required for the construction and/or acquisition of facilities specified in a mass transit plan adopted as provided in Article VI, or any alteration, revision or amendment thereof, and for meeting expenses and obligations in the operation of such facilities. No such contract or agreement, however, shall be entered into by the Authority with the Northern Virginia Transportation District unless said District has entered into the contracts or agreements with its member governments, as contemplated by § 1 (b)(4) of Article 4 of said Act, which contracts or agreements expressly provide that such contracts or agreements shall inure to the benefit of the Authority and shall be enforceable by the Authority in accordance with the provisions of § 2, Article 5 of said Act, and such contracts or agreements are acceptable to the Board. The General Assembly of Virginia hereby authorizes and designates the Authority as the agency to plan for and provide transit facilities and services for the area of Virginia encompassed within the Zone within the contemplation of Article 1, § 3 (c) of said Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Commitments on behalf of the portion of the Zone located in Maryland shall be by contract or agreement by the Authority with the Washington Suburban Transit District, pursuant to which the Authority undertakes to provide transit facilities and service in consideration for the agreement by said District to contribute to the capital required for the construction and/or acquisition of facilities specified in a mass transit plan adopted as provided in Article VI, or in any alteration, revision or amendment thereof, and for meeting expenses and obligations incurred in the operation of such facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) With respect to the federal government, the commitment or obligation to render financial assistance shall be created by appropriation or in such other manner, or by such other legislation, as the Congress shall determine. Commitments by the District of Columbia shall be by contract or agreement between the governing body of the District of Columbia and the Authority, pursuant to which the Authority undertakes, subject to the provisions of § 20 hereof, to provide transit facilities and service in consideration for the undertaking by the District of Columbia to contribute to the capital required for the construction and/or acquisition of facilities specified in a mass transit plan adopted as provided in Article VI, or in any alteration, revision or amendment thereof, and for meeting expenses and obligations incurred in the operation of such facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) (1) All payments made by the local Signatory governments for the Authority for the purpose of matching federal funds appropriated in any given year as authorized under Title VI, § 601, P.L. 110-432 regarding funding of capital and preventive maintenance projects of the Authority shall be made from amounts derived from dedicated funding sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a "dedicated funding source" means any source of funding that is earmarked or required under state or local law to be used to match federal appropriations authorized under Title VI, § 601, P.L. 110-432 for payments to the Authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative Expenses
      </p>
      <p>
       19. Prior to the time the Authority has receipts from appropriations and contracts or agreements as provided in § 18 of this Article VII, the expenses of the Authority for administration and for preparation of a mass transit and financing plan, including all engineering, financial, legal and other services required in connection therewith, shall, to the extent funds for such expenses are not provided through grants by the federal government, be borne by the District of Columbia, by the Washington Suburban Transit District and the component governments of the Northern Virginia Transportation District. Such expenses shall be allocated among such governments on the basis of population as reflected by the latest available population statistics of the Bureau of the Census; provided, however, that upon the request of any director the Board shall make the allocation upon estimates of population acceptable to the Board. The allocations shall be made by the Board and shall be included in the annual current expense budget prepared by the Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquisition of Facilities from Federal or Other Agencies
      </p>
      <p>
       20. (a) The Authority is authorized to acquire by purchase, lease or grant or in any manner other than condemnation, from the federal government or any agency thereof, from the District of Columbia, Maryland or Virginia, or any political subdivision or agency thereof, any transit and related facilities, including real and personal property and all other assets, located within the Zone, whether in operation or under construction. Such acquisition shall be made upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon and subject to such authorization or approval by the Congress and the governing body of the District of Columbia, as may be required; provided, however, that if such acquisition imposes or may impose any further or additional obligation or liability upon the Washington Suburban Transit District, the Northern Virginia Transportation District, or any component government thereof, under any contract with the Authority, the Authority shall not make the acquisition until any such affected contract has been appropriately amended.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) For such purpose, the Authority is authorized to assume all liabilities and contracts relating thereto, to assume responsibility as primary obligor, endorser or guarantor on any outstanding revenue bonds, equipment trust certificates or other form of indebtedness authorized in this Act issued by such predecessor agency or agencies and, in connection therewith, to become a party to, and assume the obligations of, any indenture or loan agreement underlying or issued in connection with any outstanding securities or debts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary Borrowing
      </p>
      <p>
       21. The Board may borrow, in anticipation of receipts, from any Signatory, the Washington Suburban Transit District, the Northern Virginia Transportation District, or any component government thereof, or from any lending institution for any purposes of this Title, including administrative expenses. Such loans shall be for a term not to exceed two years and at such rates on interest as shall be acceptable to the Board. The Signatories and any such political subdivision or agency may, in its discretion, make such loans from any available money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funding
      </p>
      <p>
       22.

       All such bonds and evidences of indebtedness shall be payable solely out of the properties and revenues of the Authority.

       29. The Board shall have no power to pledge the credit of any Signatory party, political subdivision or agency thereof, or to impose any obligation for payment of the bonds upon any Signatory party, political subdivision or agency thereof, but may pledge the contracts of such governments and agencies; provided, however, that the bonds may be underwritten in whole or in part as to principal and interest by the United States, or by any political subdivision or agency of any Signatory; provided, further, that any bonds underwritten in whole or in part as to principal and interest by the United States shall not be issued without approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.

It may provide for the issuance, sale or exchange of refunding bonds for the purpose of redeeming or retiring any bonds (including the payment of any premium, duplicate interest or cash adjustment required in connection therewith) issued by the Authority or issued by any other issuing body, the proceeds of the sale of which have been applied to any facility acquired by the Authority or which are payable out of the revenues of any facility acquired by the Authority.

All provisions of this Title applicable to the issuance of bonds are applicable to refunding bonds and to the issuance, sale or exchange thereof.

      <p>
       Bonds; Authorization Generally
      </p>
      <p>
       31. Bonds and other indebtedness of the Authority shall be authorized by resolution of the Board. The validity of the authorization and issuance of any bonds by the Authority shall not be dependent upon nor affected in any way by: (i) the disposition of bond proceeds by the Board or by contract, commitment or action taken with respect to such proceeds; or (ii) the failure to complete any part of the project for which bonds are authorized to be issued. The Authority may issue bonds in one or more series and may provide for one or more consolidated bond issues, in such principal amounts and with such terms and provisions as the Board may deem necessary. The bonds may be secured by a pledge of all or any part of the property, revenues and franchises under its control. Bonds may be issued by the Authority in such amount, with such maturities and in such denominations and form or forms, whether coupon or registered, as to principal alone or as to both principal and interest, as may be determined by the Board. The Board may provide for redemption of bonds prior to maturity on such notice and at such time or times and with such redemption provisions, including premiums, as the Board may determine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonds; Resolution and Indentures Generally
      </p>
      <p>
       32. The Board may determine and enter into indentures or adopt resolutions providing for the principal amount, date or dates, maturities, interest rate, or rates, denominations, form, registration, transfer, interchange and other provisions of bonds and coupons and the terms and conditions upon which the same shall be executed, issued, secured, sold, paid, redeemed, funded and refunded. The resolution of the Board authorizing any bond or any indenture so authorized under which the bonds are issued may include all such covenants and other provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this Title, other than any restriction on the regulatory powers vested in the Board by this Title, as the Board may deem necessary or desirable for the issue, payment, security, protection or marketing of the bonds, including without limitation covenants and other provisions as to the rates or amounts of fees, rents and other charges to be charged or made for use of the facilities; the use, pledge, custody, securing, application and disposition of such revenues, of the proceeds of the bonds, and of any other moneys or contracts of the Authority; the operation, maintenance, repair and reconstruction of the facilities and the amounts which may be expended therefor; the sale, lease or other disposition of the facilities; the insuring of the facilities and of the revenues derived therefrom; the construction or other acquisition of other facilities; the issuance of additional bonds or other indebtedness; the rights of the bondholders and of any trustee for the bondholders upon default by the Authority or otherwise; and the modification of the provisions of the indenture and of the bonds. Reference on the face of the bonds to such resolution or indenture by its date of adoption or the apparent date on the face thereof is sufficient to incorporate all of the provisions thereof and of this Title into the body of the bonds and their appurtenant coupons. Each taker and subsequent holder of the bonds or coupons, whether the coupons are attached to or detached from the bonds, has recourse to all of the provisions of the indenture and of this Title and is bound thereby.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maximum Maturity
      </p>
      <p>
       33. No bond or its terms shall mature in more than fifty years from its own date and in the event any authorized issue is divided into two or more series or divisions, the maximum maturity date herein authorized shall be calculated from the date on the face of each bond separately, irrespective of the fact that different dates may be prescribed for the bonds of each separate series or division of any authorized issue.

      <p>
       Tax Exemption
      </p>

The Board may sell bonds at less than their par or face value but no issue of bonds may be sold at an aggregate price below the par or face value thereof if such sale would result in a net interest cost to the Authority calculated upon the entire issue so sold in excess of the applicable rate determined by the Board, payable semiannually, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds according to standard tables of bond values, deducting the amount of any premium to be paid on the redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.

Such proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted in rem and the final judgment rendered therein shall be conclusive against all persons whomsoever and against each of the Signatory parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       43. No indenture need be recorded or filed in any public office, other than the office of the Board. The pledge of revenues provided in any indenture shall take effect forthwith as provided therein and irrespective of the date of receipt of such revenues by the Board or the indenture trustee. Such pledge shall be effective as provided in the indenture without physical delivery of the revenues to the Board or to the indenture trustee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pledged Revenues
      </p>
      <p>
       44. Bond redemption and interest payments shall, to the extent provided in the resolution or indenture, constitute a first, direct and exclusive charge and lien on all revenues received from the use and operation of the facility, and on any sinking or other funds created therefrom.

      </p>
      <p>
       Remedies
      </p>
      <p>
       45. The holder of any bond may for the equal benefit and protection of all holders of bonds similarly situated: (1) by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings require and compel the performance of any of the duties imposed upon the Board or assumed by it, its officers, agents or employees under the provisions of any indenture, in connection with the acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, reconstruction or insurance of the facilities, or in connection with the collection, deposit, investment, application and disbursement of the revenues derived from the operation and use of the facilities, or in connection with the deposit, investment and disbursement of the proceeds received from the sale of bonds; or (2) by action or suit in a court of competent jurisdiction of any Signatory party require the Authority to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust, or enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the holders of the bonds. The enumeration of such rights and remedies does not, however, exclude the exercise or prosecution of any other rights or remedies available to the holders of bonds.

       Construction
      </p>
      <p>
       64. The Board shall take such action as may be necessary to insure that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the construction, alteration or repair, including painting and decorating, of projects, buildings and works which are undertaken by the Authority or are financially assisted by it, shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a-276a-5), and every such employee shall receive compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in any workweek in excess of eight hours in any workday or forty hours in any workweek, as the case may be. A provision stating the minimum wages thus determined and the requirement that overtime be paid as above provided shall be set out in each project advertisement for bids and in each bid proposal form and shall be made a part of the contract covering the project, which contract shall be deemed to be a contract of the character specified in § 103 of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act (76 Stat. 357), as now or as may hereafter be in effect. The Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the administration and enforcement of the labor standards specified in this provision, the supervisory, investigatory and other authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (15 F.R. 3176, 64 Stat. 1267,5 U.S.C. 133z-15), and § 2 of the Act of June thirteen, nineteen hundred thirty-four, as amended (48 Stat. 948, as amended; 40 U.S.C. 276 (c)). The requirements of this section shall also be applicable with respect to the employment of laborers and mechanics in the construction, alteration or repair, including painting and decorating, of the transit facilities owned or controlled by the Authority where such activities are performed by a contractor pursuant to agreement with the operator of such facilities.

       66. (a) The rights, benefits, and other employee protective conditions and remedies of § 13 (c) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. Section 5333 (b)), as determined by the Secretary of Labor, shall apply to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority employees otherwise covered by the Act. The Authority shall extend to employees whose positions are adversely affected by the expenditure of federal funds obtained by WMATA pursuant to congressional appropriations, the rights, benefits, and other employee protective conditions and remedies of section 13 (c) of the Federal Transit Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. § 5333(b)).
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) The Authority shall deal with and enter into written contracts with employees as defined in § 152 of Title 29, United States Code, through accredited representatives of such employees or representatives of any labor organization authorized to act for such employees concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, and pension or retirement provisions. Each such contract entered into after the effective date of this act shall prohibit the contracting employees from engaging in any strike or an employer from engaging in any lockout.
      </p>
      <p>
       (c) In case of any labor dispute involving the Authority and such employees where collective bargaining does not result in agreement, either party may declare that an impasse has been reached between the parties and may, by written notification to the other party and to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, request the Service to appoint a mediator for the purpose of assisting them in reconciling their differences and resolving the controversy on terms which are mutually acceptable. Within five days of the receipt of the request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall appoint a mediator in accordance with its rules and procedures for such appointment. The mediator shall meet with the parties forthwith, either jointly or separately, and shall take such steps as he or she deems appropriate to persuade the parties to resolve their differences and effect a mutually acceptable agreement. The mediator shall not, however, make findings of fact or recommend terms of settlement. Each party shall pay one-half of the expenses of such mediator. If the mediator is unable to effect settlement of the controversy within fifteen days after his or her appointment, the Authority shall submit such dispute to fact finding by a board composed of three persons, one appointed by the Authority, one appointed by the labor organization representing the employees, and a third member to be agreed upon by the labor organization and the Authority. The member agreed upon by the labor organization and the Authority shall act as chairman of the board. The determination of the majority of the fact finding board thus established shall be advisory as to all matters in dispute. If after a period of ten days from the date of the appointment of the two persons representing the Authority and the labor organization, the third person has not been selected, then either of the two persons may request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish a list of five persons from which the third person shall be selected; provided, however, that the list shall not include the name of the person who served as mediator unless inclusion of his or her name is mutually agreed to by both parties. The persons appointed by the Authority and the labor organization, promptly after the receipt of such list shall determine by lot the order of elimination, and thereafter each shall in that order alternately eliminate one name until only one name remains. The remaining person on the list shall be the third member of the fact finding board. The term "labor dispute" shall be broadly construed and shall include any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, or benefits including health and welfare, sick leave, insurance or pension or retirement provisions but not limited thereto, and including any controversy concerning any differences or questions that may arise between the parties including but not limited to the making or maintaining of collective bargaining agreements, the terms to be included in such agreements, and the interpretation or application of such collective bargaining agreements. Each party shall pay one-half of the expenses of such fact finding. Under no circumstances may the parties resort to binding arbitration after the date of enactment of this act or the expiration date of any contract requiring binding arbitration, whichever is later. This prohibition against binding arbitration shall not be interpreted to preclude such arbitration of individual employee grievances.
      </p>
      <p>
       (d) The Authority is hereby authorized and empowered to establish and maintain a system of pensions and retirement benefits for such officers and employees of the Authority as may be designated or described by resolution of the Authority; to fix the terms of and restrictions on admission to such system and the classifications therein; to provide that persons eligible for admission in such pension system shall not be eligible for admission to, or receive any benefits from, any other pension system (except Social Security benefits), which is financed or funded, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly by funds paid or appropriated by the Authority to such other pension system, and to provide in connection with such pension system, a system of benefits payable to the beneficiaries and dependents of any participant in such pension system after the death of such participant (whether accidental or otherwise, whether occurring in the actual performance of duty or otherwise, or both) subject to such exceptions, conditions, restrictions and classifications as may be provided by resolution of the Authority. Such pension system shall be financed or funded by such means and in such manner as may be determined by the Authority to be economically feasible. Unless the Authority shall otherwise determine, no officer or employee of the Authority and no beneficiary or dependent of any such officer or employee shall be eligible to receive any pension or retirement or other benefits both from or under any such pension system and from or under any pension or retirement system established by an acquired transportation system or established or provided for, by or under the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement between the Authority and the representatives of its employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       (e) Whenever the Authority acquires existing transit facilities from a public or privately owned utility either in proceeding by eminent domain or otherwise, the Authority shall assume and observe all existing labor contracts and pension obligations. When the Authority acquires an existing transportation system, all employees who are necessary for the operation thereof by the Authority shall be transferred to and appointed as employees of the Authority, subject to all the rights and benefits of this Title. These employees shall be given seniority credit and sick leave, vacation, insurance and pension credits in accordance with the records or labor agreements from the acquired transportation system. Members and beneficiaries of any pension or retirement system or other benefits established by the acquired transportation system shall continue to have rights, privileges, benefits, obligations and status with respect to such established system. The Authority shall assume the obligations of any transportation system acquired by it with regard to wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, sick leave, health and welfare and pension or retirement provisions for employees. It shall assume the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement between such acquired transportation system and the representatives of its employees. The Authority and the employees, through their representatives for collective bargaining purposes, shall take whatever action may be necessary to have pension trust funds presently under the joint control of the acquired transportation system and the participating employees through their representative transferred to the trust fund to be established, maintained and administered jointly by the Authority and the participating employees through their representatives. No employee of any acquired transportation system who is transferred to a position with the Authority shall by reason of such transfer be placed in any worse position with respect to workmen's compensation, pension, seniority, wages, sick leave, vacation, health and welfare insurance or any other benefits, than he enjoyed as an employee of such acquired transportation system.
      </p>
      <p>
       (f) The Authority shall not require any person, as a condition of employment or continuation of employment, to join any labor union or labor organization. The Authority shall not require any person, as a condition of employment or continuation of employment, to pay any dues, fees, or other charges of any kind to any labor union or labor organization.

          </p>
          <p>
           (b) The Authority may provide for the procurement of property, services, or construction covered by this Section using competitive procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources of supply for that property, service, or construction if the Authority determines that excluding the source would increase or maintain competition and would likely result in reduced overall costs for procurement of property, services, or construction.

       <li id="t33.2sIVc31s33.2-3100-XVIol13">

         (1) in the case of a contract for property, services, or construction to be awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited proposal, the property, services, or construction shall be deemed to be available from only one responsible source if the source has submitted an unsolicited proposal that demonstrates a concept:
        <ol type="A">
         <li id="t33.2sIVc31s33.2-3100-XVIol14A">
          that is unique and innovative or, in the case of a service, for which the source demonstrates a unique capability to provide the service; and

         <li id="t33.2sIVc31s33.2-3100-XVIol14B">
          the substance of which is not otherwise available to the Authority and does not resemble the substance of a pending competitive procurement.
          
           (2) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment or the continued provision of highly specialized services, the property, services, or construction may be deemed to be available from only the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures if it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in:
          

           (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Authority that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or
          

           (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Authority's needs.
          

           (e) If the Authority uses procedures other than competitive procedures to procure property, services, or construction under subsection (c)(2) of this Section, the Authority shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.
          

           (f) (1) To promote efficiency and economy in contracting, the Authority may use simplified acquisition procedures for purchases of property, services and construction.
          

           (2) For the purposes of this subsection, simplified acquisition procedures may be used for purchases for an amount that does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold adopted by the federal government.
          <p>
           (3) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the procedures under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
          </p>
          <p>
           (4) In using simplified acquisition procedures, the Authority shall promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.
          </p>
          <p>
           (g) The Board shall adopt policies and procedures to implement this Section. The policies and procedures shall provide for publication of notice of procurements and other actions designed to secure competition where competitive procedures are used.
          </p>
          <p>

The Board is authorized to locate, construct and maintain any of its transit and related facilities in, upon, over, under or across any streets, highways, freeways, bridges and any other vehicular facilities, subject to the applicable laws governing such use of such facilities by public agencies. In the absence of such laws, such use of such facilities by the Board shall be subject to such reasonable conditions as the highway department or other affected agency of a Signatory party may require; provided, however, that the Board shall not construct or operate transit or related facilities upon, over, or across any parkways or park lands without the consent of, and except upon the terms and conditions required by, the agency having jurisdiction with respect to such parkways and park lands, but may construct or operate such facilities in a subway under such parkways or park lands upon such reasonable terms and conditions as may be specified by the agency having jurisdiction with respect thereto.

(a) The Authority is authorized to establish and maintain a regular police force, to be known as the Metro Transit Police, to provide protection for its patrons, personnel, and Transit facilities. The Metro Transit Police shall have the powers and duties and shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. It shall be composed of both uniformed and plain clothes personnel and shall be charged with the duty of enforcing the laws of the Signatories, and the laws, ordinances, and regulations of the political subdivisions thereof in the Transit Zone, and the rules and regulations of the Authority. The jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police shall include all the Transit facilities (including bus stops) owned, controlled, or operated by the Authority, but this restriction shall not limit the power of the Metro Transit Police to make arrests in the Transit Zone for violations committed upon, to, or against such Transit facilities committed from within or outside such Transit facilities while in hot or close pursuit, or to execute traffic citations and criminal process in accordance with subsection (c) below. The members of the Metro Transit Police shall have concurrent jurisdiction in the performance of their duties with the duly constituted law-enforcement agencies of the Signatories and of the political subdivisions thereof in which any Transit facility of the Authority is located or in which the Authority operates any Transit service. On-duty Metro Transit Police officers are authorized to make arrests off of Transit facilities within the Transit Zone when immediate action is necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare or property of an individual from actual or threatened harm or from an unlawful act. Nothing contained in this section shall either relieve any Signatory or political subdivision or agency thereof from its duty to provide police, fire, and other public safety service and protection, or limit, restrict, or interfere with the jurisdiction of or the performance of duties by the existing police, fire, and other public safety agencies. For purposes of this section, "bus stop" means that area within 150 feet of a MetroBus bus stop sign, excluding the interior of any building not owned, controlled or operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
          </p>
          <p>
           (b) A member of the Metro Transit Police shall have same powers, including the power of arrest, and shall be subject to the same limitations, including regulatory limitations, in the performance of his duties as a member of the duly constituted police force of the political subdivision in which the Metro Transit Police member is engaged in the performance of his duties. A member of the Metro Transit Police is authorized to carry and use only such weapons, including handguns, as are issued by the Authority. A member of the Metro Transit Police is subject to such additional limitations in the use of weapons as are imposed on the duly constituted police force for the political subdivision in which he is engaged in the performance of his duties.
          </p>
          <p>
           (c) Members of the Metro Transit Police shall have power to execute on the Transit facilities owned, controlled, or operated by the Authority any traffic citation or any criminal process issued by any court of any Signatory or of any political subdivision of a Signatory, for any felony, misdemeanor, or other offense against the laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations specified in subsection (a). With respect to offenses committed upon, to, or against the Transit facilities owned, controlled, or operated by the Authority, the Metro Transit Police shall have power to execute criminal process within the Transit Zone.
          </p>
          <p>
           (d) Upon the apprehension or arrest of any person by a member of the Metro Transit Police pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b), the officer, as required by the law of the place of apprehension or arrest, shall either issue a summons or a citation against the person, book the person, or deliver the person to the duly constituted police or judicial officer of the Signatory or political subdivision where the apprehension or arrest is made, for disposition as required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
           (e) The Authority shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations for the safe, convenient, and orderly use of the Transit facilities owned, controlled, or operated by the Authority, including the payment and the manner of the payment of fares or charges therefor, the protection of the Transit facilities, the control of traffic and parking upon the Transit facilities, and the safety and protection of the riding public. In the event that any such rules and regulations contravene the laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations of a Signatory or any political subdivision thereof which are existing or subsequently enacted, these laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations of the Signatory or the political subdivision shall apply and the conflicting rule or regulation, or portion thereof, of the Authority shall be void within the jurisdiction of that Signatory or political subdivision. In all other respects the rules and regulations of the Authority shall be uniform throughout the Transit Zone. The rules and regulations established under this subsection shall be adopted by the Board following public hearings held in accordance with Section 62 (c) and (d) of this Compact. The final regulation shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the Zone at least 15 days before its effective date. Any person violating any rule or regulation of the Authority shall be subject to arrest and, upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall pay a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) and costs. Criminal violations of any rule or regulation of the Authority shall be prosecuted by the Signatory or political subdivision in which the violation occurred, in the same manner by which violations of law, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Signatory or political subdivisions are prosecuted.
          </p>
          <p>
           (f) With respect to members of the Metro Transit Police, the Authority shall:
          </p>
          <p>
           (1) Establish classifications based on the nature and scope of duties, and fix and provide for their qualification, appointment, removal, tenure, term, compensation, pension, and retirement benefits;

          </p>
          <p>
           (3) Prescribe distinctive uniforms to be worn.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
           (h) Before entering upon the duties of office, each member of the Metro Transit Police shall take or subscribe to an oath or affirmation, before a person authorized to administer oaths, faithfully to perform the duties of that office.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>

          <p>

       </b>
       - This chapter, relating to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact of 1966, was enacted by Acts 2014, c. 805, effective October 1, 2014 (formerly by Acts 1966, c. 2, as amended).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 12 provides: "That (i) the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) was established pursuant to an interstate compact between Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to operate a regional mass transit system in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area; (ii) WMATA is currently the second largest rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the sixth largest bus mass transportation system in the United States; (iii) Section 16 of the WMATA compact embodies the funding principle that "the payment of the costs shall be borne by the persons using or benefiting from the Authority's facilities and services and any remaining costs shall be equitably shared among the federal, District of Columbia and participating local governments"; (iv) the operation of the rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the bus mass transportation system by WMATA provides particular and substantial benefit to the persons living, traveling, commuting, and working in those localities embraced by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission; (v) the benefits to such persons include not only access to the rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the bus mass transportation system operated by WMATA but also the lessened congestion on roadways and highways as a result of such operations; and (vi) on a typical weekday more than 340,000 trips are taken on WMATA in Virginia. On the basis of these facts, the General Assembly finds that dedicated funding is appropriate and necessary to support the capital needs of WMATA's rapid heavy rail mass transportation system."
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 13 provides: "That Virginia shall seek to appoint members to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Board of Directors (i) with experience in transit, transportation, or land use planning; transit, transportation, or other public-sector management; engineering; finance; public safety; homeland security; human resources; or the law and (ii) who are familiar with the WMATA system."
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 14 provides: "That, for projects initiated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on and after July 1, 2018, and located solely within the Commonwealth, bidders, offers, contractors, or subcontractors (i) shall not, as a condition of the contract, be required to enter into or adhere to or prohibited from entering into or adhering to agreements with one or more labor organizations and (ii) shall not otherwise be discriminated against for becoming or refusing to become or remain signatories or otherwise adhere to agreements with one or more labor organizations." Acts 2020, cc. 282 and 373, cl. 1 deleted enactment clause 14 of Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856.

      of the Code of Virginia, as amended by this act, shall not become effective until 30 days after the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland each enact legislation or take actions to provide dedicated funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The percentage of funding provided by the Commonwealth for its share of WMATA funding pursuant to this act beginning with the fiscal year that this act becomes effective, and each fiscal year thereafter, shall be proportional to the amount of funding provided by the District of Columbia and Maryland relative to their respective share of WMATA funding in that fiscal year."

      Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 12 provides: "That (i) the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) was established pursuant to an interstate compact between Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to operate a regional mass transit system in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area; (ii) WMATA is currently the second largest rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the sixth largest bus mass transportation system in the United States; (iii) Section 16 of the WMATA compact embodies the funding principle that 'the payment of the costs shall be borne by the persons using or benefiting from the Authority's facilities and services and any remaining costs shall be equitably shared among the federal, District of Columbia and participating local governments'; (iv) the operation of the rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the bus mass transportation system by WMATA provides particular and substantial benefit to the persons living, traveling, commuting, and working in those localities embraced by the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission; (v) the benefits to such persons include not only access to the rapid heavy rail mass transportation system and the bus mass transportation system operated by WMATA but also the lessened congestion on roadways and highways as a result of such operations; and (vi) on a typical weekday more than 340,000 trips are taken on WMATA in Virginia. On the basis of these facts, the General Assembly finds that dedicated funding is appropriate and necessary to support the capital needs of WMATA's rapid heavy rail mass transportation system."

     <p>
      Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 13 provides: "That Virginia shall seek to appoint members to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) Board of Directors (i) with experience in transit, transportation, or land use planning; transit, transportation, or other public-sector management; engineering; finance; public safety; homeland security; human resources; or the law and (ii) who are familiar with the WMATA system."

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the creation of a regional passenger rail station authority will enable the members to cost share an economic development asset that is not affordable to individual members. A passenger rail station authority will directly benefit and enhance the economic base of the members by allowing the development, ownership, and operation of a facility on a cooperative basis. The exercise of powers granted by this chapter shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the region and other areas of the Commonwealth, for the increase of their commerce, and for the promotion of their safety, health, welfare, convenience, and prosperity.

     <p>
      The governing bodies of any three or more members within the region may, by ordinance, create a regional passenger rail station authority. The ordinance adopted by each participating governing body shall (i) set forth the name of the proposed passenger rail station authority, which shall include the words "passenger rail station authority"; (ii) name the members; (iii) contain findings that the economic growth and development of the member and the comfort, convenience, and welfare of its citizens require the development of facilities and that the creation of a regional passenger rail station authority will facilitate development of the needed facilities; and (iv) authorize the execution of an agreement establishing the respective rights and obligations of the members regarding the authority consistent with the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a member institution of higher education, the governing body shall adopt a resolution that includes such information and intent. Such ordinances, or resolutions, shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Upon certification by the Secretary of the Commonwealth that the ordinances and resolutions required by this chapter have been filed and, upon the basis of the facts set forth therein, satisfy such requirements, the proposed authority shall be and constitute an authority for all of the purposes of this chapter, to be known and designated by the name stated in the ordinances. Upon the issuance of such certificate, the authority shall be deemed to have been lawfully and properly created and established and authorized to exercise its powers under this chapter. At any time, subsequent to the creation of an authority under this chapter, the members of the authority may, with the approval of the authority's board, be expanded to include any locality or institution of higher education within the region that was eligible to be an initial member of the authority. The governing body seeking to become a member of the authority shall evidence its intent to become a member by adopting an ordinance proposing to join the authority that conforms, to the extent possible, to the requirements for an ordinance set forth in clauses (i), (iii), and (iv).
