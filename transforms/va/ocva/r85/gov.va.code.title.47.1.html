       Legal sufficiency of notary's seal.

      - The legal sufficiency of a notary's seal is not affected by the presence or absence of the words "Commonwealth of Virginia," and a contrary result is not required by instructions contained in a handbook for notaries prepared by the Secretary of the Commonwealth regarding the form of a notary's seal.

        Upon being notified that an evidentiary proceeding has been initiated under this section, the notary who is the subject of such a proceeding shall forthwith cease to serve as a notary for a period of sixty days, or until his case has been decided, whichever period shall be shorter. If the Secretary finds that grounds for removal exist, such notary shall be further suspended from serving as a notary until the Secretary has made a final disposition of the case under subsection E of this section; however, no notarial act shall be deemed invalid solely by reason of having been performed by a notary who has been suspended pursuant to this subsection.
