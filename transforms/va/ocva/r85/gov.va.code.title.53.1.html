        Editor's note.
       </b>
       - At its regular session of 1980, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a study of Title 53 and report its findings to the Governor and General Assembly in the form of a recodification of that title. In January of 1982, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 53. This report, which was published as Senate Document No. 19 of the 1982 Session, contains reviser's notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commission's draft of the revision of Title 53, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 636 of the Acts of 1982. It repeals Title 53 of the Code and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 53.1.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to its revision by c. 636, former Title 53 was amended by certain other acts passed at the 1982 Session. As required by
       §
       30-152 and Acts 1982, c. 636, cl. 7, these amendments have been incorporated into new Title 53.1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 53 and earlier statutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 1982, c. 636, clauses 2, 3, 4, and 7, provide as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       "2. That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 53 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to July 1, 1982, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 53 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents or portions thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       "3. That the rules and regulations of the State Board of Corrections and the Virginia Parole Board in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       "4. That this recodification of Title 53 as Title 53.1 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, committee or other appointed body referred to in Title 53.1, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 53.
      </p>
      <p>
       "7. That this act shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other act enacted in the 1982 regular session of the General Assembly, and any act purporting to amend and reenact any law contained in Title 53 or Title 53.1 of the Code of Virginia is deemed to be added to, amendatory of, or a repealer of, as the case may be, any corresponding law contained in this act; provided, that effect shall be given to such other or subsequent act only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to the commencement of such session."

       Acts 1995, c. 811, cl. 2, effective April 6, 1995, provides: "That in keeping with the purposes of this act and to induce eligible state employees to voluntarily resign from employment with the Commonwealth, any full-time employee of the Commonwealth (i) whose position is covered by the Virginia Personnel Act (

         Duty to oversee enforcement of laws and regulations.
        </b>
        - The Director of the Department of Corrections has a general duty to oversee enforcement of the laws and regulations governing penal institutions within the Commonwealth and to oversee supervision of the same; thus he owed a duty to the plaintiff, a prisoner, which, if violated in the manner alleged, may have contributed to the injuries said to have been sustained. Payne v. Rollings, 402 F. Supp. 1225 (E.D. Va. 1975) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        <b>
         Liability for negligence in local jails.
        </b>
        - The Director is not liable for isolated acts of negligence occurring in local jails, and while the Director has a duty to implement the standards and goals of the board as formulated for local correctional facilities and lockups, he has no direct control over city jail employees. The Director, moreover, cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts, if any, committed by employees of the city jail. Dillon ex rel. Dillon v. Director, Dep't of Cors., 552 F. Supp. 30 (W.D. Va. 1982) (decided under prior law).

         The equal protection clause prohibits arbitrary differences in treatment

        given to state prisoners held for more than 90 days after sentencing in local jails and that accorded similarly situated inmates in state facilities. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state prisoner should not be subject to substantially worse conditions of confinement merely because the Virginia Department of Corrections happens to place him in a local jail, rather than in a state institution; such a treatment differential qualifies as arbitrary. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. Va. 1982).

     "Receiving unit."
    </b>
    - When read in conjunction with the statute, it appears that a "receiving unit" is merely a generic term for the facility where a person is first "received" into Department of Corrections custody; it does not refer to the specific facility where a person is assigned to serve his or her sentence. Duhart v. Commonwealth, No. 1672-18-4, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 256</cite> (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 12, 2019).

       <p>
        <b>
         Any failure of the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) to transfer defendant from local jail to state prison amounted only to a mere procedural violation
        </b>
        which did not implicate the Due Process Clause; assuming that this section did mandate that all felons be transferred from local jail into the custody of the VDOC within sixty days of conviction, such requirement is only a procedural device governing the location of a prisoner. For constitutional purposes, confinement is confinement, whether it be in a local jail, state prison, another state's prison, or federal prison. Counts v. Newhart, 951 F. Supp. 579 (E.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 116 F.3d 1473 (4th Cir. 1997).

         Precise equality between long-term felons held in Commonwealth and local jails is not required;

        only substantial equality is mandated. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         City jails are not required to adopt the Virginia Department of Corrections procedural regulations when holding a long-term felon
        </b>
        for the Commonwealth, as their application would not further the felon's equal protection rights and would constitute an undue intrusion into the jail's administration. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         But the Virginia Department of Corrections has sufficient authority to compel local jails to comply with its substantive regulations

        <b>
         Delays in classification for state prisoners held in the city jail

        <b>
         Privileges, opportunities, etc., of long-term felons in local jails.
        </b>
        - The Virginia Department of Corrections must provide long-term felons held in local jails with all of the work opportunities mandated by state law and VDOC regulations, as well as the same technical training, visitation privileges, recreation opportunities, and counseling services, and equalize the overcrowding. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. Va. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inmates sentenced to state incarceration who remained placed in a county jail more than 60 days after their sentences were imposed, rather than being transferred to state facilities, had no equal protection claim arising from the allegedly inferior conditions of their confinement, as compared to state facilities, because they were not similarly situated to those housed in state facilities, and if they were similarly situated to those housed in state facilities, they were not a suspect class, their incarceration status was not an immutable characteristic, nor an invidious basis of classification, and there was a rational relationship between their confinement in a local facility and the legitimate state interests of relieving overcrowding in state facilities and preserving uniformity of treatment between inmates who were incarcerated together. Khaliq v. Angelone, 72 Fed. Appx. 895, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 14548 (4th Cir. July 21, 2003).

       The Department shall develop and implement, in cooperation with and taking into account the individual needs and willingness to participate of the inmate, a comprehensive reentry plan for each person committed to the supervision of the Department, as soon as practicable, considering the prisoner's anticipated release date. Such plan shall identify educational, vocational, therapeutic, and other programs necessary to prepare the person for successful transition from prison to society upon the person's discharge and shall include mentor pairing to the extent possible. The Department shall coordinate any reentry programs provided through the Department pursuant to the reentry plan with any other reentry or other relevant programs offered by any public or private organization or entity at the local, state, or federal level, which are also included in the plan.

         Assistance of counsel as viable alternative to law library.
        </b>
        - In an action to determine whether prisoners were denied adequate legal assistance in the form of a law library, the court held that an attorney's legal assistance, which was provided for in accordance with this section, was a viable alternative to the requirement of a law library. Almond v. Davis, 639 F.2d 1086 (4th Cir. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Correctional officials' constitutional obligation to inmates not afforded access to an adequate law library is satisfied by making available the assistance of counsel pursuant to this section. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Virginia attorney assistance program would unquestionably benefit from the participation of additional lawyers, the program is basically an acceptable alternative to an adequate legal research facility. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977).

       <p>
        <b>
         Prisoners not denied access to courts when notified of availability of counsel.
        </b>
        - A prisoner who had no access to a law library as a result of his confinement in maximum security and a prisoner who had access to a law library only three times a month were not denied adequate access to legal materials or to the courts. So long as prisoners are notified of the availability of counsel for consultation under this section, the State's system adequately insures that prisoners will have their claims reviewed and presented to the courts. Williams v. Leeke, 584 F.2d 1336 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S. Ct. 2825, 61 L. Ed. 2d 276 (1979).

        <b>
         Rule prohibiting a prisoner from seeking or receiving help from fellow inmates does not interfere with his right of access to the courts,
        </b>
        for even if the State is required to provide a prisoner with some form of personal assistance in his legal matters, the provision for a court-appointed attorney fulfills that obligation. Graham v. Hutto, 437 F. Supp. 118 (E.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 571 F.2d 575 (4th Cir. 1978).

        <b>
         Prisoner's right of access to legal materials of courts held violated.
        </b>
        - Where a prisoner's access to the law library in the Richmond City Jail was restricted to 45 minutes at a time, three days a week, with no research assistance provided, and counsel for the city could neither assure the Court that the prisoner had a right to seek assistance of counsel under this section, nor that notice of such a right, if it did exist, was posted at the jail, the prisoner was denied his right of access to legal materials and to the courts. Williams v. Leeke, 584 F.2d 1336 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S. Ct. 2825, 61 L. Ed. 2d 276 (1979).

         Prisoner's bald assertion insufficient to raise doubt as to effectiveness of counsel.
        </b>
        - Prisoner's bald assertion that the court-appointed attorney for inmates represents the interests of the prison system, unsupported by facts, is insufficient to raise genuine doubts as to the effectiveness of the legal counseling provided by the attorney. Graham v. Hutto, 437 F. Supp. 118 (E.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 571 F.2d 575 (4th Cir. 1978).

         Duties of attorneys under section.

        - Attorneys appointed under this section are to advise an inmate as to problems pertaining to his incarceration. Particularly, the attorneys are to aid in the preparation of writs of habeas corpus and suits relating to the conditions of confinement. These attorneys are expected to informally present an inmate's grievance relating to conditions of incarceration to prison officials prior to taking any formal adversarial action. Attorneys appointed under the program do not represent individual inmates, but merely advise and assist them. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977).

     Jury instructions.
    </b>
    - Because this section is in the nature of a parole statute, in those cases where geriatric release is a possibility, juries shall be instructed on the possibility of geriatric release along with the instruction that parole is otherwise abolished. Fishback v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">260 Va. 104</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 629 (2000) (pursuant to the legislative summary the 2020 amendments to
    
     §

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the geriatric parole instruction because geriatric release was a possibility based on defendant's age and sentence; and the amended jury instruction was properly denied as defendant's proposed instruction was not an accurate statement of the law. Bustos v. Commonwealth, No. 1880-18-4, 2019 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 307</cite> (Dec. 27, 2019).

     Meaningful opportunity to obtain release.
    </b>
    - Imposition of two life sentences without parole on a juvenile defendant was not cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const., Amend. VIII because
    
     §
    
    53.1-40.01 provided defendant with a meaningful opportunity to obtain release in the future based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation. Angel v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">281 Va. 248</cite>, 704 S.E.2d 386, 2011 Va. LEXIS 26 (2011), cert. denied, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 7091, 132 S. Ct. 344, 181 L. Ed. 2d 216 (U.S. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a non-homicide offense committed while a juvenile, Virginia's Geriatric Release parole fails to satisfy the "meaningful" opportunity requirement of LeBlanc v. Mathena, 841 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2016), rev'd, mot. granted, 137 S. Ct. 1726, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 3720, 198 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Geriatric Release failed to comply with the requirement of
        Graham v. Florida,
        560 U.S. 48 (2010) that juvenile offenders have the opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation because it allows for the lifetime incarceration of a juvenile nonhomicide offender based solely on the heinousness or depravity of the offender's crime. In the context of federal habeas review, the court found it objectively unreasonable for the Supreme Court of Virginia to take the position that a penal regime under which it concedes early release is the exception, rather than the expectation, complies with Graham's meaningfulness requirement. LeBlanc v. Mathena, 841 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2016), rev'd, mot. granted, 137 S. Ct. 1726, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 3720, 198 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of administrative procedures governing implementation of the Geriatric Release provision, it was objectively unreasonable to conclude that Geriatric Release satisfied the requirement that juvenile offenders be able to obtain release "based on maturity and rehabilitation," when, under the plain and unambiguous language of the governing procedures, the Parole Board can deny every juvenile offender Geriatric Release for any reason whatsoever. LeBlanc v. Mathena, 841 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2016), rev'd, mot. granted, 137 S. Ct. 1726, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 3720, 198 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though a prisoner's sentence was 77 years, he could possibly be released under Virginia's geriatric release program and thus had a meaningful opportunity to receive parole; Virginia's program allowing the conditional release of geriatric prisoners provided juvenile offenders an opportunity for release based on maturity and rehabilitation, which satisfied requirements of the Eighth Amendment. Contreras v. Davis, 716 Fed. Appx. 160, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 26149 (4th Cir. Dec. 21, 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2012, 201 L. Ed. 2d 267 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly sentenced defendant a total active sentence of 99 years in prison for robbery and capital murder that were committed when he was 16 years old because Virginia's geriatric parole statute provided him with a meaningful opportunity for release on the sentence for the robbery conviction, and his discretionary life sentence, suspended after 91 years, for capital murder, was not affected by the holdings in Miller and Montgomery where he was not subjected to a mandatory life-without-parole sentence and he was allowed to present evidence of his youth and immaturity at the time of his offense during his resentencing hearing.

Upon receipt of such report, the court may enter such order withdrawing or modifying its prior authorization as it deems appropriate.

Unless an inmate has been sentenced to be executed, is serving a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, or is sentenced to a term that makes him ineligible for release, excluding the conditional release of geriatric prisoners pursuant to § 53.1-40.01, prior to 75 years of age, 10 percent of any funds received by an inmate from any source shall be deposited by the Department in the inmate's personal trust account until the account has a balance of $1,000. When the inmate's personal trust account reaches $1,000, any funds received by the inmate shall be deposited in the inmate's other account.
      </p>
      <p>
       An inmate may direct the Department at any time to deposit a portion or all of any funds received by him in the inmate's personal trust account. After the balance of a personal trust account has exceeded $1,000, an inmate may direct the Department to transfer funds from his personal trust account to any other account maintained for him; provided, however, that the balance of the personal trust account shall not fall below $1,000.
      </p>

       Funds in an inmate's personal trust account shall be paid to the inmate upon parole or final discharge.

      <p>
       Portions of the funds held by the Director or by any state correctional facility, which belong to prisoners may, in the discretion of the Director, be invested in bonds of the Commonwealth of Virginia or of the United States or in federally-insured investments. In determining how to invest the funds, the Director shall balance any long-term investments with those which permit ready accessibility to the funds. Any income or increment of increase received from the bonds or investments may be used by the Director for the benefit of the prisoners under his care.

         Constitutionality.
        </b>
        - The portion of this section permitting the Director of the Department of Corrections to use interest earned on the investment of funds belonging to prisoners for the benefit of the prisoners did not result in an unconstitutional taking without just compensation, where the interest was returned on a proportionate basis to the various correctional facilities and used by them to purchase items for the benefit of all prisoners, such as library books, newspaper and magazine subscriptions, recreation equipment, items for family visiting days and other collectively used "extras." Washlefske v. Winston, 60 F. Supp. 2d 534 (E.D. Va. 1999), aff'd, 234 F.3d 179 (4th Cir. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an inmate's limited right to the funds in his prison accounts does not derive from any traditional principle of common law but from a Virginia statute, he is not deprived of any property, for the purposes of a takings clause analysis, when the department of corrections follows the dictates of this statute in using the interest generated from those accounts. Washlefske v. Winston, 234 F.3d 179, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 31171 (4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 983, 121 S. Ct. 1627, 149 L. Ed. 2d 488 (2001).

         Use of interest on inmates funds not a "taking."
        </b>
        - The director of correction's use of the interest on inmate funds held in a trust account for the benefit of the prisoners under his care pursuant to this section does not constitute a "taking" under the constitution for which the government is required to provide just compensation.

        A finding that correction officials could not, consistently with the Constitution, revoke a single furlough and temporarily suspend participation in a work-release program without prior notice and a hearing would place the courts astride the day-to-day functioning of State prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges.

      <p>
       The Department is authorized to establish and maintain a system of residential community corrections alternative facilities for probationers and parolees whose identified risks and needs cannot be addressed by conventional probation or parole supervision and who are committed to the Department under § 19.2-316.4. The program shall include components for providing access to counseling, substance abuse testing and treatment, remedial education, and career and occupational assessment; providing assistance in securing and maintaining employment; ensuring compliance with terms and conditions of probation or parole; ensuring restitution and performance of community service; payment of fines, if any, and costs of court; and providing other programs that will assist the probationer or parolee in returning to society as a productive citizen. The Department shall perform risk and needs assessments to establish a case plan for each probationer or parolee determining the appropriate program components and program duration for that probationer or parolee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon completion of the program, the probationer or parolee shall be released from confinement and remain on probation or parole for a period of one year or for such other longer period as may be specified by the sentencing court or Parole Board. As a condition of such probation or parole following the community corrections alternative component, a probationer's or parolee's successful participation in employment, career and technical education, or other educational or treatment programs may be required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probation officers assigned to the program shall be authorized by the judges of the circuit court of the county or city in which the position is assigned. Any officer so appointed shall have the same powers and duties as specified in § 53.1-145, and such appointment shall be valid in any judicial circuit in the Commonwealth.

        - Considering schizophrenic defendant's previous probation violations and her unsuitability for alternative programs, revocation of probation and imposition of remaining sentence upon the Department of Corrections' determination that defendant was ineligible for detention center program did not constitute an abuse of discretion, despite defendant's contention that by doing so the trial court violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.

         Boot camp violated equal protection clause.
        </b>
        - Even if there were differences which justified treating male and female inmates differently, there was no compelling interest in providing male and female offenders with such unequal sentencing options where male offenders were allowed to be in a boot camp incarceration program; department of corrections did not even attempt to address what "acknowledged differences" would justify the provision of a boot camp program and favorable sentencing alternatives only to men, defendants were acting on the basis of archaic and stereotypic notions of the roles of men and women, and there was an inherent contradiction in the defendant's argument where on the one hand, defendants argue that the "acknowledged differences" between men and women justify the provision of a trial boot camp program for male inmates and on the other hand, defendants purport to want to use the results of the all-male boot camp incarceration program to determine whether the program should be extended to women.

     Inmate telephone commissions.
    </b>
    - Virginia law does not require that funds generated from inmate telephone commissions that are received by the treasurer and deposited into the city's funds to be reallocated back to the sheriff's office to be used within the facility for the benefit of the inmates. The sheriffs office may not establish and maintain a separate fund for such commissions. Regardless of the account into which the treasurer initially deposits the funds, they remain allocable to city.

      <p>
       The Board is authorized to limit, by its order, the confinement of prisoners in any local correctional facility or lock-up, which is not constructed, equipped, maintained and operated so as to comply with minimum standards prescribed by the Board, either by prohibiting confinement of any prisoners in such local correctional facility or lock-up, or by limiting the maximum number of prisoners to be confined therein, as the Board deems appropriate. The Board may designate some other local correctional facility or lock-up in or at which shall be confined persons who otherwise would have been confined in the facility subject to the Board's order. Copies of each order shall, upon being issued, be sent to the officer in charge of the facilities affected, to the governing bodies of the counties, cities and towns affected and to the judge of the circuit court of each county and city in which are located the local correctional facilities or lock-ups affected.

The Department shall apply such regulations in preparing requests for appropriations. No such reimbursement shall be had unless the plans and specifications, including the need for additional personnel, thereof have been submitted to the Governor, and the jail project has been approved by him.

      </h3>
      <p>
       No locality receiving state funds under § 53.1-85 shall use such funds for any purpose other than for paying expenses incurred as the result of the confinement of persons in local correctional facilities. The Department shall require a locality to return any portion of state funds expended in violation of this provision to the state treasury. Should an unexpended balance of state funds exist at the end of the apportionment year, the unencumbered funds in such balance may be reverted to the local treasury and subsequently shall be expended for operating expenses of local correctional facilities. In the case of regional correctional facilities, the unexpended balance of state funds shall be apportioned by the regional facility's governing body to the participating localities based on the number of prisoner days of persons confined in the facility from each jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each locality shall keep records of receipts and disbursements of state funds received pursuant to § 53.1-85. Such records shall be open for evaluation by the Department and audit by the Auditor of Public Accounts.

        § 53.1-95.10. Issuance of revenue bonds.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       An authority created pursuant to this article is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of the project.
    The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as shall be fixed by the authority, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds.
    The authority shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of this article, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth.
    The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as both principal and interest and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds.
    The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or negotiated sale, or for such price, as it may determine will best effectuate the purposes of this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proceeds of the bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same.
    If the proceeds of the bonds of any issuance, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be deemed to be the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued.
    If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery.
    The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.
    Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this article without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions other than those proceedings or conditions which are specifically required by this article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof.
    All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face substantially to the effect that neither the faith and credit of the Commonwealth nor the faith and credit of any county, city, town, or other subdivision of the Commonwealth is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds.
    The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this article shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the Commonwealth or any county, city, town, or other subdivision of the Commonwealth to levy any taxes whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment except from the funds pledged under the provisions of this article.

       </b>

      <p>
       In the discretion of an authority created pursuant to this article, any bonds issued under the provisions of this article may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth.
    Such trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the charges and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project, the rates to be charged for services, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys.
    It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority.
    Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders.
    In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.
    All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the project.

       An authority created pursuant to this article is hereby authorized to fix, revise, and charge for the use of the service furnished by the project and to contract with any unit or department of government at any level, including cities, counties, towns, authorities, regional jail boards, and the state and federal governments and their respective departments, commissions and agencies, desiring the use of any part thereof, and to fix the terms, conditions, rents, and rates of charges for such use.
    Such charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect to the aggregate of the charges from the project as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues, if any, to pay (i) the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating such project and (ii) the principal of and interest on such bonds as the same shall become due and payable and to create reserves for such purposes.
    The revenues derived from the project, except such part thereof as may be necessary to pay such cost of maintenance, repair, and operation and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds as the same shall become due, and the redemption price or the purchase price of bonds retired by call or purchase as therein provided.
    Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues or other moneys so pledged and thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
    Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority.
    The use and disposition of moneys to the credit of such sinking fund shall be subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or of such trust agreement.
    Except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or such trust agreement, such sinking fund shall be a fund for all such bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.

       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       An authority created pursuant to this article shall be eligible to receive state reimbursement for jail construction and operation in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 (§ 53.1-80 et seq.) of this chapter. State reimbursement for the cost of the project shall be made to the authority and shall be determined as if each participating political subdivision in the authority had contributed its pro rata share of such cost.
    However, when an authority created pursuant to this article enters into an agreement with one or more political subdivisions not participating in the authority for the purpose of construction and operating a jail, that share of the state reimbursement due to any political subdivision not participating in the authority shall be made directly to such political subdivision in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this chapter. The Commonwealth shall fund the positions of superintendent, correctional officers, and two-thirds of the salaries of required medical or treatment personnel on a basis approved by the State Compensation Board. Such salaries shall be paid in the manner provided in § 15.2-1609.2, and such section shall be applicable mutatis mutandis to such superintendent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The superintendent of the correctional facility shall report on the first day of each month to the Director of the State Department of Corrections to give the record of each prisoner received during the preceding month on blank forms to be furnished by the Director, to state whether the offense for each prisoner is for violation of state law or of city or town ordinance.
    The report shall be signed by both the superintendent and chairman of the authority.
    Either signer found guilty of willfully falsifying the information contained in such report shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any superintendent fails to send such report within five days after the date when the report is to be forwarded, the Director shall notify the superintendent of such failure.
    If the superintendent fails to make the report within ten days from that date, then the Director shall cause the report to be prepared from the books of the superintendent and shall certify the cost thereof to the Comptroller. The Comptroller shall issue his warrant on the Treasurer for that amount, deducting the same from any funds that may be due the superintendent by the Commonwealth.

      <p>
       Any person who has been sentenced to confinement in jail or who has been convicted of a felony but is confined in jail pursuant to § 53.1-20, in the discretion of the sheriff may be assigned by the sheriff to a work release program under the supervision of the sheriff or the administrator of a local or regional jail. The sheriff may further authorize the offender to participate in educational or other rehabilitative programs as defined in this section designed to supplement his work release employment. The court that sentenced the offender shall be notified in writing by the sheriff or the administrator of a local or regional jail of any such assignment and of the offender's place of employment or other rehabilitative program. The court, in its discretion, may thereafter revoke the authority for such an offender to participate in a work release program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff and the Director may enter into agreements whereby persons who are committed to the Department, whether such persons are housed in a state or local correctional facility, and who have met all standards for such release, may participate in a local work release program or in educational or other rehabilitative programs as defined in this section. The administrator of a regional jail and the Director may also enter into such agreements where such agreements are approved in advance by a majority of the sheriffs on the regional jail board. All persons accepted in accordance with this section shall be governed by all regulations applying to local work release, notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of the Code. Local jails shall qualify for compensation for cost of incarceration of such persons pursuant to § 53.1-20.1, less any payment for room and board collected from the inmate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an offender who has been assigned to such a program by the court is in violation of the rules of the jail pursuant to § 53.1-117, the sheriff or jail administrator may remove the offender from the work release program, either temporarily or for the duration of the offender's confinement. Upon removing an offender from the work release program, the sheriff or jail administrator shall notify in writing the court that sentenced the offender and indicate the specific violations that led to the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any offender assigned to such a program by the court or sheriff who, without proper authority or just cause, leaves the area to which he has been assigned to work or attend educational or other rehabilitative programs, or leaves the vehicle or route of travel involved in his going to or returning from such place, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. In the event such offender leaves the Commonwealth, the offender may be found guilty of an escape as provided in § 18.2-477. An offender who is found guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor in accordance with this section shall be ineligible for further participation in a work release program during his current term of confinement.

      <p>
       The Board shall prescribe regulations to govern the work release, educational and other rehabilitative programs authorized by this section.

      <p>
       Any court having jurisdiction for the trial of a person charged with a misdemeanor, traffic offense, any offense under Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20, or a felony that is not an act of violence as defined in § 19.2-297.1 may, for good cause, if the defendant is convicted and sentenced to confinement in jail and the active portion of the sentence remaining to be served is 45 days or less, impose the remaining time to be served on weekends or nonconsecutive days to permit the convicted defendant to retain gainful employment; however, the court shall not impose weekends or nonconsecutive days for a person convicted of a felony if the Commonwealth objects. A person sentenced pursuant to this section shall pay an amount to defray the cost of his keep, which amount shall be the actual cost of incarceration but shall not exceed that amount charged to the Compensation Board for purposes of reimbursement as provided in the general appropriation act. Such amount shall be collected by the sheriff, if he is responsible for operating a jail, or by the regional jail superintendent, and remitted by the sheriff to the treasurer of the appropriate county or city, or by the regional jail superintendent to the regional jail board or authority, solely for the purposes of defraying the costs of such weekend or nonconsecutive incarceration. The funds collected pursuant to this section shall not be used for purposes other than those provided for in this section. The assessment provided for herein shall be in addition to any other fees prescribed by law. If the defendant willfully fails to report at times specified by the court, the sentence imposed pursuant to this section shall be revoked and a straight jail sentence imposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an offender who has been sentenced to nonconsecutive days by the court is in violation of the rules of the jail pursuant to § 53.1-117, the sheriff or jail administrator may require the offender to serve out a portion or the entirety of the remainder of his sentence in consecutive days. Upon revoking the offender's ability to serve his sentence on nonconsecutive days, the sheriff or jail administrator shall notify in writing the court that sentenced the offender and indicate the specific violations that led to the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time served by a person sentenced for violation of state law in a local jail, regional jail, or local jail farm pursuant to this section shall be included in the count of prisoner days reported by the Department for the purpose of apportioning state funds to local correctional facilities for operating costs in accordance with § 53.1-84.

    - Home of a participant in an electronic incarceration program was not the functional equivalent of a jail or prison for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, resulting in the loss of defendant's constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, where conditions of probation did not waive constitutional guarantees. Hence, in exercising their right to visit defendant's home, officers could reasonably look around to ensure their safety; but such inspection did not justify a full search of the premises. Megel v.

      <p>
       Upon application of the person in charge of a local correctional facility, if that application is affirmed by the physician serving such facility, a judge of a circuit court is authorized to have removed from any correctional facility within his jurisdiction any person confined therein who has contracted any contagious or infectious disease dangerous to the public health. Such persons shall be removed to some other place designated by the judge. When any person is so removed, he shall be safely kept and receive proper care and attention including medical treatment. As soon as he recovers his health, he shall be returned to the correctional facility from which he was moved, unless the term of his imprisonment has expired, in which event he shall be discharged, but not until all danger of his spreading contagion has passed. Expenses incurred under and by reason of this section shall be paid as provided by law.

         Constitutionality of change in good time policy.
        </b>
        - The change in parole policy whereby any previously earned good time credits were revoked when a parolee's parole was revoked constituted a change in the exercise of the parole board's discretionary authority and was not a change in the law which could be challenged under the ex post facto clause. Warren v. Baskerville, 233 F.3d 204, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 28963 (4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 831, 122 S. Ct. 76, 151 L. Ed. 2d 41 (2001).

        <b>
         Due process clause not invoked.
        </b>
        - Neither the parole statutes nor any parole regulation has created a liberty interest in parole sufficient to invoke the due process clause. James v. Robinson, 863 F. Supp. 275 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 45 F.3d 426 (4th Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parolee does not have a fundamental or liberty interest in a discretionary final discharge from parole. Vincent v. Warden of Dillwyn Correctional Ctr., <cite class="va_code">258 Va. 48</cite>, 517 S.E.2d 17 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Virginia law gave rise to a limited interest in consideration for parole, but not in parole release, and because a parole decision was discretionary under subdivisions 1 and 2(a) of
        §
        53.1-136, there was no liberty interest in parole release, even if the board consistently exercised their discretion to grant release in the past, and while parole-eligible inmates had a right to parole consideration at a specified time, the procedures required were minimal, and since plaintiff violent offender inmates' statistics showed defendant parole board members still granted parole to violent offenders, though at lower rates, with, in over half of denials, giving reasons other than the seriousness of the offense, the inmates' Due Process claim failed. Burnette v. Fahey, 687 F.3d 171, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13925 (4th Cir. 2012).

       <p>
        <b>
         Parole board's policies constitutional.
        </b>
        - Subdivision 1 merely required the parole board to adopt, subject to approval by the Governor, general rules governing the granting of parole and eligibility requirements, which shall be published and posted for public review; because Virginia law imposed no particular decision criteria on the parole board, the inmates could not establish that the parole board failed to consider statutory factors either arbitrarily, in violation of due process, or because of the nature of their crimes, in violation of principles of equal protection. The inmates' argument did not alter the magistrate's conclusion that, pursuant to United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit law, the parole board's policies did not violate the ex post facto clause or the Eighth Amendment, and thus, the court adopted the reasoning of the magistrate judge with respect to the claims advanced again in the amended complaint. Patterson v. Kaine,, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22649 (E.D. Va. Mar. 11, 2010).

         No presumption of release.

       There shall be at least one probation and parole officer for each probation and parole district. The Director of the Department may assign officers authorized in one district to duties in another district. However, no such transfer shall be effected without the concurrence of the affected officer. Any officer so assigned shall have the same power and authority as an officer authorized by the judge or judges of the court or courts of such other district.

      <p>
       The Director shall employ officers to carry out the powers and duties prescribed in § 53.1-145 and elsewhere in this article. The Director shall submit the names of eligible officers to the judge or judges of the judicial circuit where the officer is initially assigned to be authorized to act as an officer of the court.

       The judge or judges of the judicial circuit to which an officer is assigned shall authorize the officer to serve as an officer of the court to carry out the power and duties prescribed in § 53.1-145 and elsewhere in this article. When the area of a probation and parole district lies in two or more judicial circuits, the probation and parole officers shall be authorized by joint action of the judges of the several circuits. If there are more than two such judges, a majority vote shall control the authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the authorization is to be made by two judges and they fail to agree within 60 days of the Director's assignment of such officer, the Director shall authorize the officer to serve the judicial circuits of the Commonwealth.

       The authorization of an officer by the judicial circuit to which the officer is initially assigned shall be valid in all judicial circuits in the Commonwealth regardless of subsequent assignments.

     Termination of probation officer.

    - Circuit court did not err in affirming a hearing officer's decision that despite the employer's failure to strictly comply with its own termination policy, that noncompliance was harmless error, as only the circuit court was authorized to rescind the employee's appointment as a probation officer serving that court; further, the action of the court could not have been challenged to the employer, even if the employee had been provided an opportunity to respond to the charges before her termination, as the employer could neither authorize nor rescind authorization for the employee to serve as a court-appointed probation officer.

         Subsection B violates Constitution.
        </b>
        - Subsection B expressly rescinded preexisting eligibility - and to that extent runs afoul of the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const., Art. 1,
        §
        10. Fender v. Thompson, 883 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const., Art. 1,
        §
        10, subsection B cannot be applied to revoke the petitioner's preexisting eligibility for parole on the life sentence imposed in connection with his 1973 convictions. Fender v. Thompson, 883 F.2d 303 (4th Cir. 1989).

        <b>
         Subsection B did not violate ex post facto clause as applied to petitioner.
        </b>
        - Subsection B was enacted before petitioner committed the acts for which he was now incarcerated without parole. Petitioner was on notice that he would not be eligible for parole if convicted of three or more acts defined in the statute. Thus, subsection B did not violate the ex post facto clause as applied to petitioner. Brown v. Virginia Dep't of Cors., 886 F. Supp. 531 (E.D. Va. 1995).

        <b>
         Interest in liberty conferred by statutes.
        </b>
        - The statutes governing the manner in which a prisoner shall be considered for parole confer on the prisoner an interest in liberty. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Virginia parole eligibility statute creates a statutory right to, and lists the criteria for, parole eligibility, and since a prisoner has a great interest in having those criteria applied correctly, this section, the statute governing the manner in which a prisoner is classified for parole eligibility, confers on the prisoner a liberty interest enforceable under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Krawetz v. Murray, 742 F. Supp. 304 (E.D. Va. 1990).

       <p>

         Without statute or policy, inmates do not have liberty interest.
        </b>
        - Without an applicable statute or Virginia Department of Correction's policy containing mandatory language, inmates do not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being considered for parole. Brown v. Virginia Dep't of Cors., 886 F. Supp. 531 (E.D. Va. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     "At liberty."
    </b>
    - Term "at liberty" as it is used in the statute includes situations where individuals are placed on postrelease supervision; by specifying "at liberty" includes certain situations, the statute implies that the condition of being "at liberty" is not limited to these situations. Ramsuer v. Commonwealth, No. 1122-16-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 318</cite> (Dec. 12, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        No meaningful difference exists between the legal restraint inherent in postrelease supervision, probation, or parole, and all three programs are administered through the same probation and parole districts; in light of the similarities between postrelease supervision, probation and parole, the General Assembly did not intend for postrelease supervision to be excluded from the definition of "at liberty" as used in the statute. Ramsuer v. Commonwealth, No. 1122-16-4, 2017 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 318</cite> (Dec. 12, 2017).

         Eligibility for parole is not synonymous with entitlement.
        </b>
        There is no constitutional or inherent right of a convicted person to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid sentence. Fleming v. Murray, 888 F. Supp. 734 (E.D. Va. 1994).
       </p>

        <b>
         Possibility of parole provides no more than mere hope of benefit.
        </b>
        - That the state holds out the possibility of parole provides no more than a mere hope that the benefit will be obtained. Fleming v. Murray, 888 F. Supp. 734 (E.D. Va. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         No constitutional requirement that prisoners be given access to files.
        </b>
        - There is no constitutional requirement that prisoners be given access to their files. Fleming v. Murray, 888 F. Supp. 734 (E.D. Va. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Parole is subject to due process clause.
        </b>
        - Because a prisoner has a statutory right to fair parole consideration, and because this right involves the prisoner's liberty, parole is subject to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the prisoner's interest in being considered for parole is aptly described as a privilege or a matter of grace, this characterization of the prisoner's interest does not defeat a due process claim challenging parole procedures, since the distinction between a right and a privilege is no longer an acceptable basis for determining whether the due process clause applies to a governmental benefit. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where this section prohibits parole eligibility for individuals convicted of three separate offenses of murder, rape, or armed robbery, when such offenses are not "part of a common act, transaction or scheme," and while defendant contends that two of his robberies were "part of a common act, transaction or scheme," since the Department of Corrections (DOC) found otherwise, this decision fully satisfied the requirements of the due process clause. Vann v. Angelone, 73 F.3d 519 (4th Cir. 1996).

       <p>
        <b>
         And parole procedures must be fundamentally fair.
        </b>
        - Virginia has extended an expectation of liberty in the form of parole eligibility to its prisoners, and for this reason the Constitution requires that the procedures utilized by the State in determining whether such expectation will be realized must be fundamentally fair. Jackson v. Shields, 438 F. Supp. 183 (W.D. Va. 1977).

       <p>
        <b>
         But prisoner not entitled to same rights as trial defendant.
        </b>
        - Because parole release proceedings are not part of a criminal prosecution, a prisoner is not entitled to the full panoply of rights accorded a defendant at trial. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).

          II. PAROLE BOARD PROCEDURES.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         <b>
          Parole Board, not courts, have most parole authority.
         </b>
         - Boards of parole are given absolute discretion in matters of parole. Courts cannot properly grant a parole or determine eligibility for parole and only consider the issue of eligibility for parole where the decision by the responsible parole agency is arbitrary or capricious, where the agency has abused its discretion, or where the petitioner is being denied a constitutional right. Garrett v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 154, 415 S.E.2d 245 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Notice and hearing are constitutionally required.
         </b>
         - Prisoners eligible for parole are entitled to the due process clause's minimum basic protection of reasonable notice and a personal hearing. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          As is access to Board information.
         </b>
         - A prisoner should be afforded access to the information in his files on which the parole decision is to be based, unless such access threatens prison security or poses harm to someone. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          But certain information may be withheld.
         </b>
         - The State has an interest in withholding information from a prisoner's file which could adversely affect rehabilitation and discipline. Therefore, the State may develop procedures for removing such information from a prisoner's file before allowing him access to it. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          And prisoners should not be allowed unrestricted access.
         </b>
         Procedures must be established for access that takes into consideration the interests of both the prisoner and the State. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Application of this section to defendant's previous, second offense parole eligibility date
         </b>
         violated the constitutional proscription against ex post facto laws. Schwartz v. Muncy, 834 F.2d 396 (4th Cir. 1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Discretion of Board in structuring procedure for access.
         </b>
         - The State's concern in forbidding access to the information in a prisoner's files does not outweigh the prisoner's interest. However, that concern does not require that the Virginia Parole Board be given broad discretion in structuring a procedure for allowing prisoners access. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          Prisoner has no rights of confrontation and cross-examination at parole hearing.
         </b>
         - At their parole hearings, prisoners have no right to confront and cross-examine people who have furnished the Board information about the prisoner. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          And need not be present when witnesses testify.
         </b>
         - Since a parole proceeding is not a criminal trial, the prisoner need not be present when witnesses testify. The practice of the Board of excluding the witnesses from the hearings conducted in prisons appears to be justified by considerations of discipline and security. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).

          But has a right to present evidence and witnesses.
         </b>
         - Subject to the Board's discretion to reasonably limit the hearing, the due process clause entitles a prisoner to present documentary evidence and witnesses in support of his application for parole. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784 (4th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1003, 98 S. Ct. 1659, 56 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1978).

         53.1-151: (1) the prisoner claimed that the Board had treated him differently than another inmate, who had filed a second appeal and was granted parole eligibility after showing that his crimes did not involve the use of deadly weapons; (2) the prisoner's due process violation claims were frivolous because he had such a de minimis liberty interest in parole in Virginia that he was, at most, entitled to a reason for the denial of parole eligibility, which had been provided to him; (3) the prisoner failed to assert an actionable "class of one" equal protection claim because he did not allege that the Board had intentionally and arbitrarily singled him out for the purpose of denying his second appeal while other similarly situated inmates were granted second appeals; and (4) no U.S. Const., Amend.

         - A defendant's murder of four individuals on the same night within minutes of each other, in the same bar, during the same robbery, with the same gun and the same accomplice, could not be anything but part of a common act, transaction or scheme and, therefore, did not count as separate offenses for purposes of this section's three-strikes provision which would have made the defendant ineligible for parole.

         - If a court is ever to address the question of whether defendant's crimes were part of a common scheme, and it is not at all certain the question will ever arise, the court will do so only pursuant to a determination by the Parole Board that defendant, because his crimes were not part of a common scheme, is not eligible for parole. Thus, where no such denial has occurred, i.e., Parole Board had not yet exercised its authority to determine defendant's parole eligibility status under this section, the question was not properly before the trial court.

    The parole violation was merely a part of and a continuation of his second felony sentencing, and did not constitute a new felony for which a Department of Corrections sentence was imposed as contemplated by the Virginia legislature. Krawetz v. Murray, 742 F. Supp. 304 (E.D. Va. 1990).

     Death sentence reinstated since parole ineligibility not established at original sentencing.
    </b>
    - Since judgment had not been entered on armed robbery verdict, it could not be considered as a conviction under subsection B1 of this section. Therefore, defendant was not ineligible for parole as three-time felon when the jury was considering his capital sentence, and consequently death sentence could be reinstated. Ramdass v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">248 Va. 518</cite>, 450 S.E.2d 360 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1085, 115 S. Ct. 1800, 131 L. Ed. 2d 727 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because only the Maryland murder conviction was an offense within subsection B1 of this section, and further, the Virginia capital murder and robbery with the use of a deadly weapon conviction could not be considered separately and counted as two predicate offenses under subsection B1 of this section because the offenses were part of a common transaction, defendant's criminal record contained only two offenses that could have been taken into account for purposes of subsection B1 of this section. Therefore, he was not ineligible for parole at the time of his original sentencing and his death sentence could be reinstated. Wright v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">248 Va. 485</cite>, 450 S.E.2d 361 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1085, 115 S. Ct. 1800, 131 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1995).

        Since plaintiff violent offender inmates' statistics showed defendant parole board members still granted parole to violent offenders, though at lower rates, with, in over half of denials, giving reasons other than the seriousness of the offense, the inmates' Due Process claim failed; the facts showed the board was making individual determinations with respect to violent offenders, as it was releasing numerous such offenders despite the crimes of which they were convicted, and, in many cases, it was not only considering but also relying on reasons other than the seriousness of the crime and its attendant circumstances in deciding to deny parole.

       Every person who is sentenced and committed under the laws of the Commonwealth to the Department of Corrections or as provided for in §§ 19.2-308.1, 53.1-152 or § 53.1-153 shall be released on parole by the Virginia Parole Board six months prior to his date of final release. Each person so sentenced or committed, however, shall serve a minimum of three months of his sentence prior to such a release. Persons who are so released on parole shall be subject to a minimum of six months' supervision and an additional period of parole ending on the date upon which the parolee would have served the maximum term of confinement, or any period the Board otherwise deems appropriate in accordance with § 53.1-156. Such persons shall also be subject, for the entire period of parole fixed by the Board, to such terms and conditions prescribed by the Board in accordance with § 53.1-157.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if within thirty days of a release scheduled pursuant to this section, new information is presented to the Board which gives the Board reasonable cause to believe that the release poses a clear and present danger to the life or physical safety of any person, the Board may delay the release for up to six months to investigate the matter and to refer it to law-enforcement, mental health or other appropriate authorities for investigation and any other appropriate action by such authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       No person released on parole pursuant to § 53.1-136, and whose parole is subsequently revoked, shall be released on parole pursuant to this section until at least six months have elapsed from the date of the decision revoking his parole. No person released on parole pursuant to this section, whose parole is subsequently revoked, shall thereafter be released on parole pursuant to this section. Final discharge may be extended to require the prisoner to serve the full portion of the term imposed by the sentencing court which was unexpired when the prisoner was released on parole.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of this section, (i)
       "maximum term of confinement"
       means the maximum term of incarceration established by law as punishment for the offense, (ii)
       "mandatory release date"
       means that date which is six months prior to the scheduled date of release and takes into consideration good conduct credits, and (iii)
       "final discharge"
       and
       "discharge from parole"
       mean that a prisoner is released from confinement having satisfied the full term imposed by the sentencing court without regard to good conduct credit. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to create a right or entitlement to parole.

       The Chairman or any member of the Board may at any time upon information or a showing of a violation or a probable violation by any parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision of any of the terms or conditions upon which he was released on parole or postrelease period of supervision, issue or cause to be issued, a warrant for the arrest and return of the parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision to the institution from which he was paroled, or to any other correctional facility which may be designated by the Chairman or member. However, a determination of whether a parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision returned to a correctional facility pursuant to this section shall be returned to a state or local correctional facility shall be made based on the length of the parolee's original sentence as set forth in § 53.1-20 or the period of postrelease supervision as set at sentencing. Each such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to arrest and return the parolee to actual custody in the facility from which he was paroled, or to any other facility designated by the Chairman or member.

       In any case in which the parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision is charged with the violation of any law, the violation of which caused the issuance of such warrant, upon request of the parolee or his attorney, the Chairman or member shall as soon as practicable consider all the circumstances surrounding the allegations of such violation, including the probability of conviction thereof, and may, after such consideration, release the parolee, pending adjudication of the violation charged.

Such a written statement by a probation and parole officer delivered to the officer in charge of any state or local correctional facility shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the parolee or felon serving a period of postrelease supervision.

    - Although a probation, parole, or suspended sentence revocation proceeding is not criminal in nature, the outcome of such a proceeding may result in the loss of one's liberty. Nevertheless, unless the evidence shows that the police officers who illegally seized the evidence also acted in bad faith, the exclusionary rule should not be used to prevent the evidence from being admitted into evidence in a secondary proceeding, such as a probation revocation hearing.

      <p>
       The form of the compact shall be substantially as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       A compact entered into by and among the contracting states, signatures hereto, with the consent of the Congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled "an act granting the consent of Congress to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes."
      </p>
      <p>
       The contracting states solemnly agree:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11">
        That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called "sending state"), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called "receiving state"), while on probation or parole, if:
        <ol type="a">
         <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11a">
          Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;
         </li>
         <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol11b">
          Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol12">
        That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol13">
        That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol14">
        That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol15">
        That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol16">
        That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.
       </li>
       <li id="t53.1c04a04s53.1-167ol17">
        That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months' notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.
      </p>
      <p>
       A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this compact, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.

        PURPOSE.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compacting States to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each Compacting State in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The Compacting States also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the purpose of this Compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the Compacting States: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the Compact among the Compacting States. In addition, this Compact will: create an Interstate Commission, which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies and which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this Compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of State Councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compacting States recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the Compacting States that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

The Interstate Commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the Compacting States in accordance with the terms of this Compact.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall consist of Commissioners selected and appointed by resident members of a State Council for Interstate Adult Offender Supervision for each State. In addition to the Commissioners who are the voting representatives of each State, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not Commissioners but who are members of interested organizations. Such noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex officio (nonvoting) members. The Interstate Commission may provide in its Bylaws for such additional, ex officio, nonvoting members as it deems necessary.

        Each Compacting State represented at any meeting of the Interstate Commission is entitled to one vote. A majority of the Compacting States shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the Bylaws of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of 27 or more Compacting States, shall call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings, and meetings shall be open to the public.

       <p>
        Each Member of the Interstate Commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that Compacting State is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission. A Member shall vote in person on behalf of the State and shall not delegate a vote to another member State. However, a State Council shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the Commissioner from that State, to case a vote on behalf of the member State at a specified meeting. The Bylaws may provide for Members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where Members are present in person.

        The Interstate Commission's Bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such Rules, the Interstate Commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law-enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
       </p>

       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compacting State to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of the State and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each Compacting State and shall promulgate a Rule binding upon all Compacting States, which governs said assessment.

        COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any State, as defined in Article II of this Compact, is eligible to become a Compacting State. The Compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the Compact into law by no less than 35 of the States. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2002, or upon enactment into law by the 35th State. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other Compacting State, upon enactment of the Compact into law by that State. The governors of nonmember States or their designees will be invited to participate in Interstate Commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the Compact by all States and territories of the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments to the Compact may be proposed by the Interstate Commission for enactment by the Compacting States. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the Compacting States.

        WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.

       <p>
        Section A. Withdrawal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once effective, the Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every Compacting State; provided, that a Compacting State may withdraw from the Compact (hereinafter Withdrawing State) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the Compact into law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Withdrawing State shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this Compact in the Withdrawing State. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other Compacting States of the Withdrawing State's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Withdrawing State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement following withdrawal of any Compacting State shall occur upon the Withdrawing State reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section B. Default.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the Interstate Commission determines that any Compacting State has at any time defaulted (hereinafter Defaulting State) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, the Bylaws or any duly promulgated Rules the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t53.1c04a06s53.1-176.2-aXIIol11">
         Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;
        </li>
        <li id="t53.1c04a06s53.1-176.2-aXIIol12">
         Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;
        </li>
        <li id="t53.1c04a06s53.1-176.2-aXIIol13">
         Suspension and termination of membership in the Compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the Bylaws and Rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the State Council.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a Compacting State to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, Interstate Commission Bylaws, or duly promulgated Rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the Defaulting State in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the Defaulting State pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the Defaulting State must cure its default. If the Defaulting State fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the Defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of majority of the Compacting States and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a Defaulting State, the Interstate Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer and the majority and minority leaders of the Defaulting State's legislature and the State Council of such termination.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Defaulting State is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the Defaulting State unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the Defaulting State.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement following termination of any Compacting State requires both a reenactment of the Compact by the Defaulting State and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the Rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section C. Judicial Enforcement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the Members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the Federal District where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provision of the Compact, its duly promulgated Rules and Bylaws, against any Compacting State in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys' fees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section D. Dissolution of Compact.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the Compacting State that reduces membership in the Compact to one Compacting State. Upon the dissolution of this Compact, the Compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the Bylaws.

       <p>
        Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Compacting State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.

       </p>
       <p>
        All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all Rules and Bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the Compacting States.

       <p>
        All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the Compacting States are binding in accordance with their terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the request of the party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the Compacting States, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any Compacting State, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the Compacting State and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.

         Discrimination between those who choose to appeal their convictions and those who do not is constitutionally intolerable
        </b>
        because it tends to impede open and equal access to appellate review since it may deter a defendant from appealing because of a fear that the sentencing judge will not give him credit for the time that he has spent in jail pending appeal. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).

       <p>
        <b>
         And may inhibit exercise of appeal right.
        </b>
        - Since, in Virginia, where a convicted criminal defendant appeals his conviction, his sentence does not begin to run until final disposition of the appeal, if a convicted person were not given post-conviction confinement credit toward his sentence, then he might be inhibited from exercising his right of appeal. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).

        <b>
         Effect of failure to give post-conviction credit is to punish person twice.
        </b>
        - The failure to give post-conviction credit to a convicted person who remains in confinement pending appeal effectively punishes that person twice for the same offense. Punishment is exacted once by confining the person from conviction to final disposition of his appeal, and is exacted again when the convicted person begins service of his sentence. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).

        <b>
         So State must fully credit post-conviction confinement.
        </b>
        - In order to preclude the possibility, therefore, that a convicted person will suffer multiple punishment for the same offense in violation of the "double jeopardy" clause, the State must fully credit post-conviction confinement toward the sentence to be served by a criminal defendant, because it is punishment already exacted. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).

       <p>
        <b>
         Sentences need not be served in order of imposition.

        <b>
     Term of confinement may be computed from date of first valid sentence.
    </b>
    - At the date of prisoner's sentence, when he was being improperly held on a void sentence, there was no reason why the provision of this section should not be applied and the term of his confinement be computed from the date of the subsequent, valid sentence. Peyton v. Christian, <cite class="va_code">208 Va. 105</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 335 (1967).

     Commencement of subsequent consecutive sentences where time served on void convictions.
    </b>
    - Where a prisoner has been serving a number of consecutive sentences in prison, and where the Attorney General concedes the invalidity of four of the prisoner's convictions, while the prisoner is not entitled to credit for time served on the void convictions, the invalidity of his first four convictions leaves nothing to postpone the commencement of his subsequent sentences from the date of imposition of sentence which will necessarily result in an advancement of his release. Morris v. Superintendent of Va. State Penitentiary, <cite class="va_code">212 Va. 656</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 200 (1972).

     Where a prisoner's parole was revoked after he had been imprisoned for another offense,

      </h3>
      <p>
       Any person who is sentenced to a term of confinement in a correctional facility shall have deducted from any such term all time actually spent by the person in a state hospital for examination purposes or treatment prior to trial, in a state or local correctional facility awaiting trial or pending an appeal, or in a juvenile detention facility awaiting trial for an offense for which, upon conviction, such juvenile is sentenced to an adult correctional facility. When entering the final order in any such case, the court shall provide that the person so convicted be given credit for the time so spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In no case shall a person be allowed credit for time not actually spent in confinement or in detention. In no case is a person on bail to be regarded as in confinement for the purposes of this statute. No such credit shall be given to any person who escapes from a state or local correctional facility or is absent without leave from a juvenile detention facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person sentenced to confinement in a state correctional facility, in whose case the final order entered by the court in which he was convicted fails to provide for the credit authorized by this section, shall nevertheless receive credit for the time so spent in a state correctional facility. Such allowance of credit shall be in addition to the good conduct allowance provided for in Articles 2 (§ 53.1-192 et seq.) and 3 (§ 53.1-198 et seq.) of this chapter or the earned sentence credits provided for in Article 4 (§ 53.1-202.2 et seq.) of this chapter.

         Constitutional right to credit for jail time awaiting trial and pending appeal.
        </b>
        - The right of credit for jail time awaiting trial on a bailable offense and pending appeal is not a matter of legislative grace but is a right constitutionally mandated, available to state prisoners as well as federal prisoners. Durkin v. Davis, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to sentence credit is bottomed squarely upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sixth Amendment, made obligatory upon the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that a convicted person be given credit toward his sentence for all pre-conviction confinement served. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Whether convicted individual is indigent or not.
        </b>
        - It is now the law in the Fourth Circuit that an individual convicted of a crime has a constitutional entitlement to pre-conviction confinement sentence credit, whether indigent or not. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>

        Equal protection clause commands that indigent criminal defendant be given pre-conviction confinement credit toward his sentence. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Should a convicted indigent be incarcerated pending appeal because he is too poor to make bail, where bail would have been otherwise available, the equal protection clause commands that he be given sentence credit for all post-conviction confinement served. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).

       <p>
        <b>
         Or else invidious discrimination may result.
        </b>
        - The failure to give pre-conviction confinement credit to that class of persons who are too poor to make bail would work an invidious discrimination against them solely because of their indigency. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no rational justification for validating a system which requires the poor to suffer greater punishment than the wealthy solely because of their indigency, and the failure to credit a convicted indigent's sentence with all pre-conviction confinement served constitutes invidious discrimination against the poor. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Because of inability to make bail.
        </b>
        - Convicted indigents who served pre-conviction confinement because they were too poor to make bail would have to pay a greater penalty than those convicted for the same crimes who were wealthy enough to make bail. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Right to pre-conviction and post-conviction credit on sentence constitutes "liberty."
        </b>
        - The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The right to pre-conviction and post-conviction confinement sentence credit constitutes an interest in "liberty" because when such credit is withdrawn, the sentence that a State prisoner must serve is automatically increased and the date for parole eligibility is, thereby, extended. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And is absolute.
        </b>
        - In light of the "liberty" interest involved, the right to pre-conviction and post-conviction confinement sentence credit is sourced in the United States Constitution and is, therefore, absolute. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249 (E.D. Va. 1975), rev'd on other grounds, 538 F.2d 1037 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>

        <b>
         Failure to give pre-conviction sentence credit to convicted criminal defendant may burden Sixth Amendment right
        </b>

The prospect of lingering in jail until trial and earning no credit toward one's sentence, if found guilty, may induce the defendant to give a quick guilty plea so that he can start serving off his sentence.

        - Exercising a strict reading of
        §
        53.1-187, jail credit should only apply to the offenses for which the defendant is awaiting trial. Therefore, time served for one matter cannot apply to sentences for any potential future trials, nor any past convictions. Credit can only be applied to sentences far convictions directly stemming from charges the defendant is awaiting trial for. A logical common sense reading supports the interpretation that this section applies to time spend in pretrial detention on charges that result in conviction. Commonwealth v. Batra,, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 477 (Fairfax County Nov. 25, 2020).

         Credit for all time in jail awaiting trial.
        </b>
        - Defendant must be given credit for all of his or her time in jail awaiting trial; the corollary to this principle is that no jail credit can be reserved for possible use in the future if it can be applied to a sentence directly associated with the defendant's detention. Commonwealth v. Carter, 93 Va. Cir. 129, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2016).

         Determination of sentencing credits.
        </b>
        - Jailer of all local correctional facilities was designated as the repository for all of the information needed to determine sentence credits; the court was without jurisdiction to determine the issue of defendant's claimed sentence credit, as this decision rested solely within the discretion of the Department of Corrections and its designees. Commonwealth v. Bertini, 68 Va. Cir. 255, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 118 (Fairfax County 2005).

        <b>
         Unused jail credit applied to sentence.
        </b>
        - Statute required that the days of unused jail credit be applied to defendant's sentence arising out of a detainer from another county, notwithstanding the sheriff's policy of reserving unused jail credit for potential future revocations, because the statute only required jail credit on the offense for which defendant was awaiting trial. Commonwealth v. Carter, 93 Va. Cir. 129, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a defendant who complies with his or her probation obligations, and therefore never uses the withheld jail credit, there is no practical difference between treating the credit as reserved for future use and treating it as if it never existed in the first place; the fact that other jails in the Commonwealth may have the same policy is of little consequence to an inmate who has earned, but cannot use, jail credits to which he or she is entitled. Commonwealth v. Carter, 93 Va. Cir. 129, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jail credit is not some fungible commodity that can be banked by an inmate against the day when the inmate might commit a new crime or be sentenced for an old one, and there is nothing in the statute to suggest otherwise; the statute only requires jail credit on the offense for which the defendant is "awaiting trial."

         Requirements for adjudicatory proceedings.
        </b>
        - In adjudicatory proceedings, certain due process rights are necessary and will not unduly impede legitimate prison functions. First, the decision to punish must be made by an impartial tribunal. This bars any official who reported a violation from ruling. Second, there shall be a hearing. Disposition of charges on the basis of written reports is insufficient. Necessarily a hearing encompasses the right to present evidence in defense, including the testimony of voluntary witnesses. A hearing must be preceded by notice in writing of the substance of the factual charge of misconduct. Only with written notice can a prisoner prepare to meet claims and insist that the hearing be kept within bounds. A reasonable interval to prepare a defense must be allowed as well. Cross-examination of adverse witnesses likewise is necessary. Fundamental to due process is that the ultimate decision be based upon evidence presented at the hearing, which the prisoner has the opportunity to refute. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621 (E.D.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The Director, with the consent of the Governor, may allow to any prisoner confined in a state correctional facility a credit toward his term of confinement if he (i) renders assistance in preventing the escape of another prisoner or in the apprehension of an escaped prisoner; (ii) gives a blood donation to another prisoner; (iii) voluntarily or at the instance of a prison official renders other extraordinary services; or (iv) suffers bodily injury while in the prison system. The Director shall determine the amount of any such credit for each such service or injury. In unusual circumstances a prisoner may receive credit for donating blood, under regulations prescribed by the Director, to blood banks licensed by or subject to regulations of the State Board of Health. The Director may allow the credit permitted by this section to a prisoner who has been sentenced to the Department of Corrections but who is confined in a local correctional facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as provided hereafter, any credit allowed under the provisions of this section shall be applied as provided in § 53.1-199. A prisoner who has been sentenced to a term of life imprisonment or to two or more life sentences shall be eligible for credits allowed under the provisions of this section. One-half of such credit shall be applied to reduce the period of time such prisoner shall serve before being eligible for parole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Credits allowed under the provisions of this section may not be forfeited under § 53.1-189. Credits shall not be allowed under the provisions of this section to apply toward a term of confinement imposed upon a conviction of a felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995.

      <p>
       Every person who, on or after July 1, 1981, has been convicted of a felony and every person convicted of a misdemeanor and to whom the provisions of §§ 53.1-151, 53.1-152 or § 53.1-153 apply, and every person who, in accordance with § 53.1-198, chooses the system of good conduct allowances set out herein, may be entitled to good conduct allowance not to exceed the amount set forth in § 53.1-201. Such good conduct allowance shall be applied to reduce the person's maximum term of confinement while he is confined in any state correctional facility. One-half of the credit allowed under the provisions of § 53.1-201 shall be applied to reduce the period of time a person shall serve before being eligible for parole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person who, on or after July 1, 1993, has been sentenced upon a conviction of murder in the first degree, rape in violation of § 18.2-61, forcible sodomy, animate or inanimate object sexual penetration or aggravated sexual battery and any person who has been sentenced to a term of life imprisonment or two or more life sentences shall be classified within the system established by § 53.1-201. Such person shall be eligible for no more than ten days good conduct credit for each thirty days served, regardless of the class to which he is assigned. One-half of such credit shall be applied to reduce the period of time he shall serve before being eligible for parole. Additional good conduct credits may be approved by the Director for such persons in accordance with § 53.1-191.

         ICC hearing differs from disciplinary hearing.
        </b>
        - An Institutional Classification Committee (ICC) hearing held for the purpose of adjusting an inmate's good conduct allowance (GCA) assignment differs from a disciplinary hearing in two substantial respects. First, a negative outcome at an ICC hearing does not have the stigma of wrongdoing or punishment attached to it. Second, while the outcome at a disciplinary hearing turns on a very precise set of facts, the ICC's GCA assessment involves a holistic approach to both the inmate's record and the goals of the institution.

         No protected liberty interest in class.

         Effect of good time credits on life sentence.
        </b>
        If an inmate is serving a life sentence, good time credits count only towards hastening his parole eligibility date, not his release date, since he has no release date and, once the inmate has become eligible for parole, additional good time credits have no further effect.

         Due process hearing.

        Plaintiff would have been entitled to some level of due process if the change in his good conduct allowance (GCA) status was intended as a punishment or a disciplinary action. Holmes v. Cooper, 872 F. Supp. 298 (W.D. Va. 1995).

      <p>
       A maximum of four and one-half sentence credits may be earned for each 30 days served. The earning of sentence credits shall be conditioned, in part, upon full participation in and cooperation with programs to which a person is assigned pursuant to § 53.1-32.1. For a juvenile sentenced to serve a portion of his sentence as a serious juvenile offender under § 16.1-285.1, consideration for earning sentence credits shall be conditioned, in part, upon full participation in and cooperation with programs afforded to the juvenile during that portion of the sentence. The Department of Juvenile Justice shall provide a report that describes the juvenile's adherence to the facility's rules and the juvenile's progress toward treatment goals and objectives while sentenced as a serious juvenile offender under § 16.1-285.1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no portion of any sentence credits earned shall be applied to reduce the period of time a person must serve before becoming eligible for parole upon any sentence.

    - Trial court erred in failing to declare mistrial following prosecutor's comments about defendant's eligibility for parole, and its own remarks about defendant's ability to have his sentence reduced for good time.

Fact that identical conduct by nonprisoners may result in a lesser penalty does not by itself offend the equal protection clause. Because the classification between prisoners and nonprisoners is not an invidious or suspect one, such as one based on race or religion, or does not regulate a fundamental interest, such as free speech or voting, this classification need only be rationally related to a legitimate State purpose.

         In order to justify transfer of trial from courthouse to another location,
        </b>
        the trial court must adopt and implement adequate measures that will not unduly infringe upon the public trial guarantee and will assure freedom of access to the trial. Provision should be made for reasonable notice to the parties and general population who have a right to expect the trial to be held at the courthouse in accordance with the statute. Furthermore, administrative convenience is insufficient, standing alone, to justify a transfer of a criminal trial from the courthouse. These standards govern the decision to transfer a criminal trial from a courthouse courtroom to a prison courtroom. Vescuso v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 59, 360 S.E.2d 547 (1987), overruling Dammerau v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 285, 349 S.E.2d 409 (1986), to the extent these decisions conflict.

         Burden of proving trial inside prison was public trial.
        </b>
        - The burden was upon defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were denied a public trial. However, upon a showing that the trial was held within the perimeter walls of a medium security prison, the defendants proved a prima facie case of denial of a public trial. Although the burden of persuasion remains upon defendant throughout the trial, once the prima facie case is made, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the Commonwealth and it is incumbent upon it to produce evidence to justify the transfer of the trial from the regular courthouse to another location. Vescuso v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 59, 360 S.E.2d 547 (1987), overruling Dammerau v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 285, 349 S.E.2d 409 (1986), to the extent these decisions conflict.

         Possession in District of Columbia penal facility.
        </b>
        - In a federal case involving the possession of illegal drugs in a District of Columbia penal facility, the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C.
        §
        13, plainly permitted the assimilation of subdivisions 5 and 6 of this section. United States v. Broadnax, 688 F. Supp. 1080 (E.D. Va. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant waived his argument that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knowingly possessed drugs because when defendant renewed his motion to strike, which was a separate and distinct motion from his original motion to strike, he failed to inform the circuit court that one of the grounds upon which he relied was the lack of evidence proving scienter; instead, defendant focused only on whether the evidence proved that he possessed the drugs. McFadden v. Commonwealth, No. 2026-17-2, 2018 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 270</cite> (Oct. 16, 2018).
       </p>

        Evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the drugs in his pocket because his cellmate testified that he was wearing the jeans in which the drugs were found when correctional officers announced a strip search; the correctional officers were in the cell with defendant when he removed the jeans and placed them on the bed, and they remained in the cell with defendant and the jeans until the drugs were recovered from his jeans.

         Juror's bias against inmate required exclusion from jury.

        - The judge's refusal to exclude juror from the jury panel constituted reversible error where the prosecution's case rested entirely upon the testimony of a correctional officer and
    defendant's (an inmate) evidence in defense consisted of his own testimony and that of another inmate and juror revealed his bias for believing officer over inmate in clear, unequivocal terms, and this unfaltering biased viewpoint, viewed in light of the significance of the credibility issue to the outcome of the case, raised a reasonable doubt as to juror's qualifications and should have led to his exclusion from the jury panel.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possessing an unauthorized weapon capable of causing death or injury while a prisoner in a state, local, or community correctional center; defendant conceded that he was in actual possession of a razor blade found in his shoe, but claimed that the evidence failed to prove he intentionally and consciously possessed it, and contended that another inmate might have been able to sneak the razor blade past the searches and might have hidden the razor blade in defendant's shoe while defendant slept in order to avoid punishment for possession of such contraband if it had been found on him in the impending search. The trial court, as the finder of fact, was entitled to reject the testimony of defendant, who had prior felony convictions, as not credible, and once the trial court rejected defendant's testimony that he was asleep with his shoes off immediately before the search, the remaining evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, provided no indication that anyone other than defendant had access to his shoes at a time when they also had an incentive to hide the razor blade inside.

     Proof of attempted escape.
    </b>
    - Defendant's attempted escape from a correctional facility conviction was upheld, as his combined acts of leaving his assigned residential unit and culminating in climbing one of the last three remaining fences within a correctional facility's secured perimeter, amounted to more than mere preparation and were performed in furtherance of the exclusive purpose of escaping the facility, supporting an attempted escape charge; moreover, defendant's statement, when confronted by an official that he was going to see his daughter, showed his specific intent to escape the facility and that he had committed said series of acts aimed at the consummation of that escape. Harvey v. Commonwealth, No. 0712-05-2, 2006 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 256</cite> (Ct of Appeals June 6, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because defendant and another inmate specifically focused their combined efforts on reaching and attempting to drive away in a truck, which was crucial to the success of their attempted escape, the evidence was sufficient to find that there was an agreement between them to attempt an escape, in violation of
    
     §
    
    53.1-203; the fact that there was no evidence of an actual conversation between defendant and the other inmate was not dispositive. Charity v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 581, 643 S.E.2d 503, 2007 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 173</cite> (2007).

          Convict outside of correctional facility.

          Escape while working on public road.

       The Agreement on Detainers is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this Commonwealth with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
       THE AGREEMENT ON DETAINERS

      <p>

        ARTICLE I.
       </h4>
       <p>
        The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

The warden, commissioner of corrections or other officials having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner.

         Constitutional and statutory provisions as to extradition.
        </b>
        - Matters of extradition are constitutionally controlled by Article IV, section 2, clause 2, of the United States Constitution. They are statutorily controlled by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (
        §
        19.2-85 et seq.) and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (this chapter). Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was notified of her rights pursuant to this section and provided the documentation necessary to trigger the benefits of the act, but did nothing to comply for nine months, after which time both Michigan and the Commonwealth fully complied with the required mandates, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred, as a matter of law, by holding that the accused's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated because the reason for the delay was legitimate; while at the time of his indictment accused was physically incarcerated in the city jail, he was legally in federal custody awaiting trial on multiple federal drug charges.

         Governor performs judicial function.
        </b>
        - When the governor of an asylum state acts on an extradition request, he performs a judicial function. Accordingly, he would be entitled to absolute immunity in carrying out this function. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

       <p>
        <b>
         The only function of an attorney general, in extradition proceedings,
        </b>
        is to assist the governor in determining whether extradition ought to be granted. In this sense, he is entitled to absolute immunity because of the quasi-judicial function he is performing. If it be deemed that his duty in this connection be that of an advocate, he is entitled to the absolute immunity accorded public prosecutors. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

         Governor of asylum state to make factual findings and legal conclusions.
        </b>
        - While the Constitution mandates that a fugitive in one state "shall" be returned to the demanding state, the governor of the asylum state must make factual findings and legal conclusions following specific inquiries prior to granting extradition. First, he must determine whether the accused has been charged with a crime under the laws of the demanding state, and second, whether the accused was within the demanding state at the time of the offense. The former is generally a question of law but it may be a question of fact. The latter is generally a question of fact. The governor's factual determination may not be set aside unless it appears conclusively that the accused could not be a fugitive. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

         This section provides a means for an accused detained in a sister state to demand a prompt trial in exchange for his voluntary return

        to the accusatory state; however, he may not exercise his right to demand that the trial be held within the limitation contained in this section unless his cause has progressed through the pretrial steps to a point where it is ready for disposition immediately upon his return.

         The purpose of this congressionally sanctioned interstate compact

         The agreement is designed to protect prisoners and prisoner rehabilitation programs in two ways.
        </b>
        First, it seeks to eliminate the uncertainty pending charges may create in the prisoner's mind by requiring prompt disposition of those charges. Second, the agreement attempts to ensure that interruptions of the prisoner's incarceration are cut to a minimum, so that the prisoner's continuous physical presence in the sending jurisdiction's rehabilitative programs will be guaranteed. Stewart v. Bailey, 7 F.3d 384 (4th Cir. 1993).

         No further judicial inquiry as to probable cause may be had in asylum state after governor acts.
        </b>
        - Once the governor of the asylum state has acted on a requisition for extradition based on the demanding state's judicial determination that probable cause existed, no further judicial inquiry may be had on that issue in the asylum state. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345 (E.D. Va. 1985).

        <b>
         Immunity from damages where statutory duty breached.

        - Notice to defendant, who was incarcerated in Connecticut, that a detainer had been lodged against him constituted substantial compliance with Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. Any failure or delay by Connecticut in notifying defendant of his right to request final disposition of the charges, after being advised of the detainer lodged against him, did not constitute a substantial violation of Article III. Dismissal is not a required sanction for such a notification omission under Article III. Giardino v. Commonwealth, No. 0509-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 17, 1987).

         Purposes of Article IV (e) and double jeopardy clause compared.
        </b>
        - The values protected by the double jeopardy clause are different from those protected by the agreement. The guarantee against double jeopardy is directed at the evil of a second trial in and of itself. In contrast, the purpose of the Article IV (e) restriction on prosecutions is to insure prompt disposition of detainers. Brown v. Mitchell, 598 F.2d 835 (4th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1123, 101 S. Ct. 939, 67 L. Ed. 2d 109 (1981).

        - Article IV(e) of the agreement requires the dismissal of a federal indictment against a prisoner who is obtained from state custody while under a federal detainer if he is returned to state custody without first being tried on the indictment underlying the detainer. United States v. Boyce, 518 F. Supp. 862 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 681 F.2d 817 (4th Cir. 1982).

         Writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.

        - A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum, issued by the courts of a jurisdiction party to the agreement on detainers to state authorities in another party jurisdiction, requesting custody of a state prisoner for trial on criminal charges, is not a "detainer" within the meaning of the Agreement on Detainers.

        - While appellant maintained that he should not be punished for the prison official's dereliction of duty, nothing in the record supported his contention that he sent his notice of request for final disposition to the prison official. Without evidence that he did so, the court cannot presume that appellant did in fact request the certificate from the warden. When alleging a violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), the prisoner bears the burden of establishing that the required notice was given. Eckard v. Commonwealth, 20 Va.

     Right of convict to waive appointment of committee.

    - There are no statutes or rules to deny a convict, already within the civil jurisdiction of the court at the time of his felony conviction and incarceration, the privilege of waiving the appointment of a committee and proceeding to trial and judgment in a law action in which he is represented by counsel of his own choosing.

       <p>
        When a convict objected that he had no estate to be committed, and that the party making the motion for the appointment of his committee had no interest in the appointment, these facts were in issue and should have been affirmatively established, in order to support the jurisdiction of the trial court.

        - The executive clemency process available under this chapter and Va. Const., Art. V,
        §

    was to substitute a sentence of life imprisonment for the death penalty, a substitution the Governor was empowered to make without the defendant's consent. Lewis v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 31</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 320 (1977) (decided under prior law).

     Substituted penalty is only sentence considered on appeal.

    - After commutation of a sentence of death, the penalty substituted therefor is the only sentence to be considered on appeal. In such circumstances, the defendant's status is to be reviewed as though the substituted sentence, and not the allegedly invalid death penalty, had been imposed originally. Lewis v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">218 Va. 31</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 320 (1977).

      </h3>
      <p>
       This section shall apply to any person who is not a qualified voter because of a felony conviction, who seeks to have his right to register to vote restored and become eligible to register to vote, and who meets the conditions and requirements set out in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person, other than a person (i) convicted of a violent felony as defined in § 19.2-297.1 or in subsection C of § 17.1-805 and any crime ancillary thereto; (ii) convicted of a felony pursuant to <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.04.1.html#t4.1sIIc11s4.1-1101" target="_blank">§ 4.1-1101</a></cite>, 18.2-248, 18.2-248.01, 18.2-248.1, 18.2-255, 18.2-255.2, or 18.2-258.02; or (iii) convicted of a felony pursuant to § 24.2-1016, may petition the circuit court of the county or city in which he was convicted of a felony, or the circuit court of the county or city in which he presently resides, for restoration of his civil right to be eligible to register to vote through the process set out in this section. On such petition, the court may approve the petition for restoration to the person of his right if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that the petitioner has completed, five or more years previously, service of any sentence and any modification of sentence including probation, parole, and suspension of sentence; that the petitioner has demonstrated civic responsibility through community or comparable service; and that the petitioner has been free from criminal convictions, excluding traffic infractions, for the same period.
    <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If the court approves the petition, it shall so state in an order, provide a copy of the order to the petitioner, and transmit its order to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The order shall state that the petitioner's right to be eligible to register to vote may be restored by the date that is 90 days after the date of the order, subject to the approval or denial of restoration of that right by the Governor. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall transmit the order to the Governor who may grant or deny the petition for restoration of the right to be eligible to register to vote approved by the court order. The Secretary of the Commonwealth shall send, within 90 days of the date of the order, to the petitioner at the address stated on the court's order, a certificate of restoration of that right or notice that the Governor has denied the restoration of that right. The Governor's denial of a petition for the restoration of voting rights shall be a final decision and the petitioner shall have no right of appeal. The Secretary shall notify the court and the State Board of Elections in each case of the restoration of the right or denial of restoration by the Governor.
      </p>
      <p>
       On receipt of the certificate of restoration of the right to register to vote from the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the petitioner, who is otherwise a qualified voter, shall become eligible to register to vote.

    - Trial court erred in denying the former felon's petition for approval of the former felon's request seeking to restore the former felon's right to vote, as the statute permitting the petition only allowed the trial court to determine whether the former felon met the requirements necessary to restore that right; the statute did not violate separation of powers principles because the governor still had the power to determine whether the right would be restored and the statute was not fundamentally flawed for not giving the Commonwealth notice that a petition had been filed as the Commonwealth was not an interested party entitled to notice.
