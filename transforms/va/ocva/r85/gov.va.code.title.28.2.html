     Power over state-owned bottomlands.

    - Pursuant to governing law, the property owner's rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the line of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owner's roof and second-story deck added to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commission's permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private pier's placement for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

     State Marine Resources Commission's authority.

    -
    Commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owner's after-the-fact permit to include an upper deck bar structure on the pier that the owner rebuilt after a hurricane. The commission did not have any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of a permit application and, instead, was directed to permit 'reasonable uses' of state-owned bottomland pursuant to
    
     §
    
    28.2-1204, and permitting the bar structure was acceptable because the pier was open to the public for the public's use and enjoyment. Boone v. Harrison, 52 Va. App. 53, 660 S.E.2d 704, 2008 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 246</cite> (2008).

    - While Executive Orders 58 and 66 enabled individuals to reconstruct or build replacements for piers and other structures damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Isabel, nothing limited the authority of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) to grant permits to expand or enlarge upon those pre-September 18, 2003, uses.

    - An Indian who habitually resides on an Indian reservation or an Indian that is a member of a Virginia recognized tribe
    who resides in the Commonwealth is not required to obtain a license to fish in Virginia's inland waters, or to hunt or trap in Virginia. Members of the Virginia tribes that were parties to the Treaty of 1677 with England are not required to obtain a license to fish or oyster in Virginia's tidal waters provided the activity is limited to harvesting for sustenance. Virginia Indians are bound by the trapping, hunting and fishing laws and regulations of the Commonwealth regardless of whether they are on or off a reservation.

         Burden of conservation may not be placed entirely on nonresidents without proper showing.

        - Virginia may not through its statutes place almost the entire burden of conservation on nonresidents, with no showing that they are the source of the evil. A crabber, whether from Virginia or another state, must be free to engage in his livelihood subject only to reasonable, nondiscriminatory rules related to those Virginia imposes on its own citizenry.

        - Absent any restriction on commercial trade in crabs after they are harvested, and recognizing that residents of other states are not precluded in any way by Virginia from coming to Virginia as consumers of a natural resource, and also recognizing the want of any congressional preemption as to the blue crab fishery, the commerce clause (U.S. Const., Art. I,
        §
        8, cl. 2), does not reach a state law whose effect is to prohibit a nonresident commercial crabber from catching crabs in Virginia. Tangier Sound Watermen's Assoc. v. Douglas, 541 F. Supp. 1287 (E.D. Va. 1982) (decided under former

     Substantial evidence supported revocation.
    </b>
    - Circuit court erred in finding that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission's (VMRC) decision to revoke fishers' licenses and privileges was not supported by substantial evidence because there was substantial evidence to support VMRC's finding that both fishers had violated a provision within the "Tidal Fisheries" subtitle; evidence of the fishers' convictions was presented to VMRC at the hearing, and neither fisher disputed that they had been convicted.

       <p>
        Circuit court erred in finding that the sanction imposed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) was not substantially supported by the evidence because the presumption of regularity was not rebutted by the evidence, and there was affirmative evidence that VMRC considered all three factors in fixing the duration of their punishment; fishers' revocation period did not exceed the statutory maximum of two years. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 109</cite> (2015).

     Commission did not retroactively apply statute.
    </b>
    - Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) did not retroactively apply the statute to a fisher because its decision to revoke his fishing license and privileges was based on a violation of the subtitle that occurred after the amendments became effective; no ex post facto concerns were implicated because the fisher's license and fishing privileges were revoked pursuant to the statute based on conduct that occurred after the amendments. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 109</cite> (2015).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Consideration of factors.
    </b>
    - Statute does not require that Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) must affirmatively find evidence of any of the factors listed as a precondition to revoke an individual's fishing license and privileges and does not require that VMRC must affirmatively find evidence of one or any of the factors listed in fixing the duration of any revocation period. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 109</cite> (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is required in fixing the duration of the revocation period is that Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) must consider evidence of those factors in making its determination and cannot exclude any of the factors as insignificant; therefore, as long as VMRC considers the three factors listed in the statute in fixing the duration of the revocation period, VMRC's actions are not beyond its statutory discretion.

      <p>
       The license for taking clams, by ordinary or patent tongs, shall entitle the holder to take only clams from the public bottoms in the waters of the Commonwealth but not from the public oyster rocks, beds, and shoals or from leased oyster grounds.
    Such a license does not permit the taking of oysters. The Commission may authorize the taking of clams from the public oyster rocks, beds, and shoals of (i) the lower York River below the patent tong line and (ii) that area in the Poquoson River contained within Public Ground Tract No. 1 and Public Ground Tract No.
    9, west of a line connecting York Point and Hunt's Point and northeast of a line connecting Hunt's Point and survey Station "Spit" when it determines that commercial quantities of oysters are not present and are not likely to return due to the presence of oyster diseases. However, the Commission shall annually review the conditions in the area designated under clause (ii) to determine whether to authorize the taking of clams.

       Any resident of the Commonwealth holding under legal assignment an oyster-planting ground of at least three acres in one tract or adjoining tracts and having paid the rent may dredge or scrape his tracts at any time from sunrise until sunset, except on Sunday if the resident has obtained from the Commission a permit for each boat so used. The permit shall show the name of the lessee and the name or number of the boat, date of issue, and date of expiration. The expiration date shall not be more than 12 months from the date of issue and may be renewed for like periods. A special exemption may be granted on such a permit to allow dredging or scraping one hour prior to sunrise from June 15 to September 1, provided that the resident notify the Commission at least 24 hours prior to such activity. The Commission may, after a hearing, refuse to grant or renew a permit to dredge or scrape any oyster-planting ground unless it is proved that the holder has planted seed oysters or shells and is using the planting ground for the cultivation of oysters. The Commission may refuse to grant the permit if it appears at the hearing that the holder of the ground is a habitual violator of the seafood laws. An applicant for the permit shall have the right of appeal from any decision of the Commission refusing to grant the permit as provided in Article 3 (§ 28.2-216 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of this subtitle.

       The public oyster beds, rocks, and shoals shall not include any area needed for an erosion control structure if the Commission, after considering the comments of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, and any other relevant evidence, finds that: (i) shoreline erosion has occurred at the site and is expected to continue; (ii) such erosion is increasing the sediment load to public waters, causing degradation of water quality; (iii) the proposed project is a technically and environmentally acceptable way to control erosion at the site unless such Baylor ground is productive under § 28.2-630 of the Code of Virginia in which case the environmentally preferable erosion control shall be utilized; and (iv) the Commonwealth's interest in protecting water quality by controlling erosion at the site outweighs the value of the portion of the natural oyster beds, rocks, and shoals affected by the erosion control structure. Whenever the area of the natural oyster beds, rocks, and shoals is so changed, the Commission shall make the changes on its Baylor survey charts.

    - It is evident that the Virginia Code expressly forbids a service district from condemning or exercising eminent domain when said grounds are leased for oyster planting. Whatever authority the General Assembly has granted to a city to dredge waterways does not include the right to do so in an area subject to an active oyster lease, nor does it authorize the city to invalidate a lease issued under
    
     §

       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not give the Virginia Marine Resources Commission discretion to deny or modify the lease based upon its likely interference with a city's proposed dredging project as the application did not fall within any of the limited circumstances under which the Commission could have refused to issue the lease.

      <p>
       The provisions of this article apply to all Virginia counties and cities bordering on bodies of water in oyster-growing areas, except they shall not apply to riparian lands located above the James River bridge in the James River or its tributaries.
    In any Virginia county or city where more than one-half acre of ground per waterfront tract has been assigned to a riparian owner, the ground in excess of one-half acre shall be ground held under a regular lease and assignment, and not a riparian assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Northampton County, however, § 6 of Chapter 254 of the 1883-1884 Acts of Assembly, not this article, shall govern the quantity of land to be assigned to and held by riparian owners. Nothing in this article authorizes a rental of a lesser amount per acre than that provided by law for riparian owners in Northampton County of the land assigned them as such riparian owners.
    Nothing in the section which restores to riparian owners in Northampton County one-fourth of their waterfronts suitable for planting oysters, permits the owners of waterfronts to compel occupants of the fronts to remove their oysters from any fourth of the shores, if the residue of the shore is already in the landowner's possession or is unoccupied.

       Whenever leased oyster ground in the Lynnhaven River and its tributaries has been condemned by the Commissioner of the State Department of Health for not less than 180 consecutive days, other than regular seasonal condemnation, the lessee, after prior written notice to the Commission, may choose not to pay the rent on the condemned acreage for the year immediately following the year in which the one hundred eightieth day of condemnation occurs. This choice may continue until the condemnation is terminated.
    However, if the lessee makes such a choice, (i) oysters or clams shall not be taken from such leased area by the lessee for any reason during the condemnation period; (ii) the lease shall continue to run; and (iii) the lessee may renew the lease as provided by law.

       All assignments or leases of oyster or clam grounds under this chapter shall be subject to the rights vested in riparian claimants under Article 1 (§ 28.2-600 et seq.) of this chapter and also to the following condition: That any landowner who desires to erect a bulkhead or wharf in front of his property or to open a channel, and who is not a lessee or riparian holder of suitable bottoms for that purpose, shall give the lessee or other holder of oyster or clam grounds in front of his property twelve months' notice of such intention; and upon the expiration of that time, the rights of the lessee or holder of so much of the oyster or clam grounds as are reasonably needed for building the bulkhead, wharf, or channel shall cease. This twelve-month notice and waiting period shall not apply if, at the time the landowner provides notice to the lessee or other holder of the oyster or clam grounds in front of his property, the landowner provides the Commissioner sufficient information describing the dimensions and location of the bulkhead, wharf or channel and the Commissioner subsequently finds, in writing, that the proposed bulkhead, wharf or channel will not adversely impact commercially productive oyster or clam grounds. For purposes of this section "commercially productive oyster or clam grounds" are those areas which can be demonstrated to have (i) suitable substrate for oyster or clam production and (ii) evidence of commercial oyster or clam production within the past three years. If the bulkhead, wharf, or channel has not commenced as specified in the notice within three months after the oyster or clam grounds were vacated, the former lessee or holder shall have the right to resume possession of the oyster or clam grounds he has vacated in favor of such landowners, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Any person constructing a channel under this section shall compensate the lessee of any oyster or clam grounds for all losses or damages including the value of the ground taken for the construction of the channel. The lessee shall have recourse under action of the law in the court of the proper jurisdiction of the Commonwealth of Virginia to recover damages.

      </h3>
      <p>
       ARTICLE I
       The purpose of this compact is to promote the better utilization of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous of the Atlantic seaboard by the development of a joint program for the promotion and protection of such fisheries, and by the prevention of the physical waste of the fisheries from any cause. It is not the purpose of this compact to authorize the states joining herein to limit the production of fish or fish products for the purpose of establishing or fixing the price thereof, or creating and perpetuating monopoly.
       ARTICLE II
       This agreement shall become operative immediately as to those states executing it whenever any two or more of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida have executed it in the form that is in accordance with the laws of the executing state and the Congress has given its consent. Any state contiguous with any of the aforementioned states and riparian upon waters frequented by anadromous fish, flowing into waters under the jurisdiction of any of the aforementioned states, may become a party hereto as hereinafter provided.
       ARTICLE III
       Each state joining herein shall appoint three representatives to a Commission hereby constituted and designated as the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. One shall be the executive officer of the administrative agency of such state charged with the conservation of the fisheries resources to which this compact pertains or, if there be more than one officer or agency, the official of that state named by the governor thereof. The second shall be a member of the legislature of such state designated by the Commission or Committee on Interstate Cooperation of such state, or if there be none, or if said Commission on Interstate Cooperation cannot constitutionally designate the said member:
    such legislator shall be designated by the governor thereof; provided, that if it is constitutionally impossible to appoint a legislator as a commissioner from such state, the second member shall be appointed by the governor of said state in his discretion. The third shall be a citizen who shall have a knowledge of and interest in the marine fisheries problem, to be appointed by the governor.
    The Commission shall be a body corporate with the powers and duties set forth herein.
       ARTICLE IV
       The duty of the said Commission shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about the consideration of the prevention of the depletion and physical waste of the fisheries, marine, shell and anadromous, of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall have power to recommend the coordination of the exercise of the police powers of the several states within their respective jurisdictions to promote the preservation of those fisheries and their protection against overfishing, waste, depletion or any abuse whatsoever and to assure a continuing yield from the fisheries resources of the aforementioned states.
       To that end the Commission shall draft and, after consultation with the Advisory Committee hereinafter authorized, recommend to the governors and legislatures of the various signatory states legislation dealing with the conservation of the marine, shell and anadromous fisheries of the Atlantic seaboard. The Commission shall, more than one month prior to any regular meeting of the legislature in any signatory state, present to the governor of the state its recommendations relating to enactments to be made by the legislature of that state in furthering the intents and purposes of this compact.
       The Commission shall consult with and advise the pertinent administrative agencies in the states party hereto with regard to problems connected with the fisheries and recommend the adoption of such regulations as it deems advisable.
       The Commission shall have power to recommend to the states party hereto the stocking of the waters of such states with fish and fish eggs, or joint stocking by some or all of the states party hereto, and when two or more of the states shall jointly stock waters the Commission shall act as the coordinating agency for such stocking.
       ARTICLE V
       The Commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice-chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers and employees as may be required to carry the provision of this compact into effect, and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation. Said Commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of its business. It may establish and maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place but must meet at least once a year.
       ARTICLE VI
       No action shall be taken by the Commission in regard to its general affairs except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states present at any meeting. No recommendation shall be made by the Commission in regard to any species of fish except by the affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states which have an interest in such species. The Commission shall define what shall be an interest.
       ARTICLE VII
       The Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior of the Government of the United States shall act as the primary research agency of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, cooperating with the research agencies in each state for that purpose. Representatives of the said Fish and Wildlife Service shall attend the meetings of the Commission.
       An Advisory Committee to be representative of the commercial fishermen and the salt water anglers and such other interest of each state as the Commission deems advisable shall be established by the Commission as soon as practicable for the purpose of advising the Commission upon such recommendations as it may desire to make.
       ARTICLE VIII
       When any state other than those named specifically in Article II of this compact shall become a party thereto for the purpose of conserving its anadromous fish in accordance with the provisions of Article II the participation of such state in the action of the Commission shall be limited to such species of anadromous fish.
       ARTICLE IX
       Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing additional conditions and restrictions to conserve its fisheries.
       ARTICLE X
       Continued absence of representation or of any representative on the Commission from any state party hereto shall be brought to the attention of the governor thereof.
       ARTICLE XI
       The states party hereto agree to make annual appropriations to the support of the Commission in proportion to the primary market value of the products of their fisheries, exclusive of cod and haddock, as recorded in the most recent published reports of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the Interior, provided no state shall contribute less than two hundred dollars per annum and the annual contribution of each state above the minimum shall be figured to the nearest one hundred dollars.
       The compacting states agree to appropriate initially the annual amounts scheduled below, which amounts are calculated in the manner set forth herein, on the basis of the catch record of 1938. Subsequent budgets shall be recommended by a majority of the Commission and the cost thereof allocated equitably among the states in accordance with their respective interests and submitted to the compacting states.

       AMENDMENT NUMBER 1
       The states consenting to this amendment agree that any two or more of them may designate the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission as joint regulatory agency with such powers as they may jointly confer from time to time for the regulation of the fishing operations of the citizens and vessels of such designating states with respect to specific fisheries in which such states have a common interest.
    The representatives of such states on the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission shall constitute a separate section of such Commission for the exercise of the additional powers so granted provided that the states so acting shall appropriate additional funds for this purpose. The creation of such section as a joint regulatory agency shall not deprive the states participating therein of any of their privileges or powers or responsibilities in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission under the general compact.

       PREAMBLE
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, Maryland and Virginia are both vitally interested in conserving and improving the valuable fishery resources of the Tidewater portion of the Potomac River, and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, certain provisions of the Compact of 1785 between Maryland and Virginia having become obsolete, Maryland and Virginia each recognizing that Maryland is the owner of the Potomac River bed and waters to the low-water mark of the southern shore thereof, as laid out on the Mathews-Nelson Survey of 1927, and that Virginia is the owner of the Potomac River bed and waters southerly from said low-water mark as laid out, and that the citizens of Virginia have certain riparian rights along the southern shore of the river, as shown on said Mathews-Nelson Survey, and, in common with the citizens of Maryland, the right of fishing in said river, Maryland and Virginia have agreed that the necessary conservation and improvement of the Tidewater portion of the Potomac fishery resources can be best achieved by a Commission comprised of representatives of both Maryland and Virginia, charged with the establishment and maintenance of a program to conserve and improve these resources, and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, at a meeting of the Commissioners appointed by the Governors of the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia, to wit: Carlyle Barton, M. William Adelson, Stephen R. Collins, Edward S. Delaplaine and William J. McWilliams, Esquires, on the part of the State of Maryland, and Mills E. Godwin, Jr., Howard H. Adams, Robert Y. Button, John Warren Cooke and Edward E. Lane, Esquires, on the part of the Commonwealth of Virginia, at Mount Vernon, Virginia, on the twentieth day of December, in the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight, the following Potomac River Compact of 1958 between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of Maryland was mutually agreed to by the said Commissioners:
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commissioners appointed by the Governors of the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia, meeting in joint session, that they do unanimously recommend to the said respective Governors that there be a new compact, to be designated as the "Potomac River Compact of 1958," and that the said new compact be referred as promptly as possible to the legislatures of the State of Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia for appropriate action, and to the end and after ratification and adoption by said legislatures the same be submitted to the Congress of the United States for approval.

         Regulation of water withdrawal and waterway construction.
        </b>
        - The drafters of the 1785 Compact carefully delineated the instances in which the citizens of one State would be subject to the regulatory authority of the other; furthermore, the Black-Jenkins Award gives Virginia sovereign authority, free from regulation by Maryland, to build improvements appurtenant to her shore and to withdraw water from the river, subject to the constraints of federal common law and the Award. Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U.S. 56, 124 S. Ct. 598, 157 L. Ed. 2d 461, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 9192 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Maryland has asserted a right to regulate Virginia's water withdrawal for, at most, 43 years, and a right to regulate waterway construction for, at most, 32 years, but even assuming such a short prescriptive period would be adequate to overcome a sovereign right, Maryland's claim fails because it has not proved Virginia's acquiescence, since Virginia vigorously protested Maryland's asserted authority.

         Regulation of fisheries.
        </b>
        - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) designation of an area of the Potomac River as a national marine sanctuary displaces the authority of the Potomac River Fisheries Commission to regulate fisheries in the area; NOAA has the authority to regulate fishing in the Potomac Sanctuary but has not chosen to exercise that authority in this instance, and while NOAA cannot enter into a binding agreement in which it bargains away its authority, the Governor of Maryland is empowered under National Marine Sanctuaries Act to effectively veto any attempt by NOAA to directly regulate fishing in the Potomac Sanctuary. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John M.R. Bull, Commissioner, Virginia Marine Resources Commission, No. 17-007, 2017 Va. AG LEXIS 8 (3/15/17).

      </p>
      <p>
       "Inherent risks of a marine tourism activity"
       means those dangers or conditions that are an integral part of a marine tourism activity, including certain hazards, such as surface and subsurface conditions; natural conditions of water; natural behaviors and dangers of varied marine products; and ordinary dangers of boats, structures, or equipment ordinarily used in commercial fishing operations. Inherent risks of marine tourism activities also includes the potential of a participant to act in a negligent manner that may contribute to injury to the participant or others, including failing to follow instructions given by the marine tourism professional or failing to exercise reasonable caution while engaging in the marine tourism activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Marine products"
       means any marine fish, shellfish, or organism that inhabits marine or estuarine waters. Terrapin and marine mammals are considered to be marine organisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Marine tourism activity"
       means any activity carried out by a marine tourism professional that allows members of the general public, for recreational, entertainment, or educational purposes, to view or enjoy marine activities related to the historic and contemporary culture, practice, and industry of commercial fishermen. Marine tourism activities may take place on land or water and shall include aquaculture and fishing, as defined in § 28.2-100. An activity is a marine tourism activity whether or not the participant paid to participate in the activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Marine tourism professional"
       means any commercial fisherman, as defined in subsection D of § 28.2-241, or any person supervised by a commercial fisherman who is engaged in the business of providing one or more marine tourism activities, whether or not for compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Participant"
       means any person, other than a marine professional, who engages in marine tourism activities.

         Rights of riparian owner.

        - The riparian owner always had certain rights in the adjacent submerged land, such as to enjoy the natural advantage of his location; to use a right-of-way to and from the navigable water; to build a pier or wharf, subject to the regulation of the state; to have the benefit of accretions or alluvium, and to make reasonable use of the water as it flows past his land. However, the common-law rights of the owner of land adjacent to tidal waters were never considered to include the right to remove substances from the soil under water. The common law is, however, subject to modification by statute. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822 (4th Cir. 1957) (decided under former

        Pursuant to governing law, the property owner's rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the line of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owner's roof and second-story deck added to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commission's permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private pier's placement for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

        It cannot be doubted that in Virginia the title of the landowner runs only to the low-water mark, and that title to the soil under tidal waters is in the state.

     Course of boundary at low-water mark.
    </b>
    - The limits or boundaries of the lands being extended by the law down to low-water mark, it necessarily follows, in the absence of any direction in this section to the contrary, that they must be extended in the same direction that they reach ordinary high-water mark. To extend a limit or bound is to extend a line, and to extend a line is to carry it forward, to prolong it, and to prolong it means primarily to continue it in the same direction. Groner v. Foster, <cite class="va_code">94 Va. 650</cite>, 27 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 493</cite> (1897); Whealton v.

       <p>
        Pursuant to governing law, the property owner's rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the line of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owner's roof and second-story deck added to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commission's permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private pier's placement for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

    - This section, in terms extends the rights of riparian owners of land on bays, rivers, creeks and shores of the sea to low-water mark. However this line may change either for the advantage or disadvantage of the riparian owner, due to accretion or recession, low-water mark remains his true boundary.

       There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Marine Habitat and Waterways Improvement Fund, hereafter referred to as "the Fund." The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. In addition to the receipt of moneys as may be specifically provided by law, the Commissioner is authorized to accept gifts and grants for the Fund, as well as proceeds that may be received from time to time on the sale of state-owned marine lands. Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited to it. Any moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purposes of improving marine habitat and waterways, including the removal of obstructions or hazardous property from state waters as authorized in §§ 15.2-909 and 28.2-1210. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon written request signed by the Commissioner.

     State Marine Resources Commission's authority.
    </b>
    - Pursuant to governing law, the property owner's rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the line of navigability was to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could, and did, authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owner's roof and second-story deck added to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commission's permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private pier's placement for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters. Evelyn v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm'n, 46 Va. App. 618, 621 S.E.2d 130, 2005 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 428</cite> (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in affirming the Virginia Marine Resources Commission's decision to deny the property owner's after-the-fact permit application to allow a storage shed to remain on the pier that the property owner was allowed to run from his property to a creek; substantial evidence in the record supported the agency's decision that the shed was not necessary in light of all of the relevant factors that it normally considered.

    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    28.2-1205 required VMRC to consider the effect of a proposed project on adjacent or nearby properties, the owners had a direct and substantial interest in the litigation simply by virtue of the fact that VMRC was required to consider the project's effect on their property prior to granting the permit.

Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4(b), and the court of appeals erred in resolving the matter solely by reference to the Rule; subsection F provides that only a "person aggrieved" by a decision of the Commission is entitled to judicial review of that decision, and thus, compliance with Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4 does not insulate a petition from a dispositive motion based on the failure to include allegations to show that the petitioner had the requisite standing to pursue the appeal since the Rule cannot supersede or displace other statutes relevant to the appeal under the Virginia Administrative Process Act,

    - Commission did not improperly delegate its decision making authority regarding the owner's after-the-fact-permit application when it considered what the city had done in regard to a complaint that the owner's newly-constructed upper deck bar structure might generate too much noise. Pursuant to subsection B of

     Consideration of relevant factors.

    - Legislature did not restrict the commission's judgment to any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of the commission's permitting decision and, thus, the commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owner's after-the-fact permit application to include an upper deck bar structure on the owner's pier after a hurricane. Pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §
    
    28.2-1205, the commission was guided in its decision by an emphasis on preserving the environment, by a concern for the public having access to public lands for recreation, and maintaining as a public trust the public resources for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the Commonwealth's people.

        A neighbor's challenges to the issuance of a bridge permit failed because it did not deprive her of, or legally affect, any property rights, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission evaluated the merits of the project and considered all of the statutory factors, the neighbor lacked standing to challenge the permit where it provided the landlocked owner access to his land without any appreciable damage to the environment, and the stream over which the bridge was built did not implicate any navigation issues or pose a threat to the neighbor's property from flooding.

        - In a condemnation proceeding condemning a permanent utility easement along the southern boundary of the triplex parcel owned by defendant, because the evidence conclusively established that the gazebo and pier were located below the mean low-water mark, they were not within the boundaries of the triplex parcel as the property was held in public trust by the Commonwealth, and not within the area of any easement in defendant's land; thus, the appellate court would not consider any potential loss of use of the gazebo and pier in calculating the value of the easement.

        Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from the designated enforcement officer, the Commissioner may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in subsection B of this section, issue an order requiring all or part of the activities on the site to be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken. In the case of an activity not authorized under this chapter or where the alleged permit noncompliance is causing, or is in imminent danger of causing, significant harm to the subaqueous bottoms protected by this chapter, the order may be issued without regard to whether the person has been issued a notice to comply as specified in subsection B of this section.
    Otherwise, the order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with the notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven days from the date of service pending application by the Commissioner, permittee, resident owner, occupier, or operator for appropriate relief to the circuit court of the jurisdiction where the violation was alleged to have occurred. Upon completion of corrective action, the order shall immediately be lifted.

        Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from a designated enforcement officer, the Commission may order that the affected site be restored to its previous condition if the Commission finds that restoration is necessary to recover lost resources or to prevent further damage to resources.
    The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at least thirty days' notice to the affected person of the hearing's time, place and purpose and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the Commission.
    The Commission shall require any scientific monitoring plan it believes is necessary to ensure the successful restoration of subaqueous bottoms protected by this chapter and may require that a prepaid contract acceptable to the Commission be in effect for the purpose of carrying out the scientific monitoring plan.
    The Commission may also require a reasonable bond or letter of credit in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it securing to the Commonwealth compliance with the conditions set forth in the restoration order. The appropriate court, upon petition by the Commission, may enforce any such restoration order by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy.
    Failure to complete the required restoration is a violation of this chapter.

     Legislative authority.
    </b>
    - Legislature did not restrict the commission's judgment to any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of the commission's permitting decision and, thus, the commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owner's after-the-fact permit application to include an upper deck bar structure on the owner's pier after a hurricane. Pursuant to subsection A of
    
     §

        - Flood control activities are "public facilities" as defined in
        §§
        28.2-1300 and 28.2-1400, and thus when a local government undertakes a flood control project, it is engaging in "governmental activity."

        The Commissioner or board chairman may require such on-site inspections as he believes are reasonably necessary to determine whether the measures required by the permit are being properly performed, or whether the provisions of this chapter are being violated.
    Prior to conducting any inspection, the Commissioner or board chairman shall provide notice to the resident owner, occupier, or operator, who shall be given an opportunity to accompany the site inspector. If it is determined that there is a failure to comply with the permit, the Commissioner or board chairman shall serve notice upon the permittee at the address specified in his permit application or by delivery at the site of the permitted activities to the person supervising those activities and designated in the permit to receive the notice.
    The notice shall describe the measures needed for compliance and the time within which these measures shall be completed.
    Failure of the person to comply within the specified period is a violation of this section.

In the case of an activity not authorized under this chapter or where the alleged permit noncompliance is causing, or is in imminent danger of causing, significant harm to the wetlands protected by this chapter, the order may be issued without regard to whether the person has been issued a notice to comply pursuant to subsection B of this section. Otherwise, the order may be issued only after the permittee has failed to comply with the notice to comply. The order shall be served in the same manner as a notice to comply, and shall remain in effect for a period of seven days from the date of service pending application by the enforcing authority, permittee, resident owner, occupier, or operator for appropriate relief to the circuit court of the jurisdiction where the violation was alleged to have occurred. Upon completion of corrective action, the order shall immediately be lifted.
    Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commissioner or board chairman from taking any other action specified in § 28.2-1316.

        Upon receipt of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from a designated enforcement officer, the Commission or a wetlands board may order that the affected site be restored to predevelopment conditions if the Commission or board finds that restoration is necessary to recover lost resources or to prevent further damage to resources.
    The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at least thirty days' notice to the affected person of the hearing's time, place, and purpose, and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the Commission or board. The Commission or board shall require any scientific monitoring plan they believe necessary to ensure the successful reestablishment of wetlands protected by this chapter and may require that a prepaid contract acceptable to the Commission or board be in effect for the purpose of carrying out the scientific monitoring plan.
    The Commission or board may also require a reasonable bond or letter of credit in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it securing to the Commonwealth compliance with the conditions set forth in the restoration order. The appropriate court, upon petition by the Commission or board, may enforce any such restoration order by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy.
    Failure to complete the required restoration is a violation of this chapter.

         "Governmental activity."
        </b>
        - Flood control activities are "public facilities" as defined in
        §§
        28.2-1300 and 28.2-1400, and thus when a local government undertakes a flood control project, it is engaging in "governmental activity." See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Stephen G. Bowman, Commissioner, Virginia Marine Resources Commission, 19-017, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS ____ (9/6/19).

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Beach" means the shoreline zone comprised of unconsolidated sandy material upon which there is a mutual interaction of the forces of erosion, sediment transport and deposition that extends from the low water line landward to where there is a marked change in either material composition or physiographic form such as a dune, bluff, or marsh, or where no such change can be identified, to the line of woody vegetation (usually the effective limit of stormwaves), or the nearest impermeable man-made structure, such as a bulkhead, revetment, or paved road.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Coastal primary sand dune" or "dune" means a mound of unconsolidated sandy soil which is contiguous to mean high water, whose landward and lateral limits are marked by a change in grade from ten percent or greater to less than ten percent, and upon which is growing any of the following species: American beach grass (Ammophila breviligulata); beach heather (Hudsonia tomentosa); dune bean (Strophostyles spp.); dusty miller (Artemisia stelleriana); saltmeadow hay (Spartina patens); seabeach sandwort (Honckenya peploides); sea oats (Uniola paniculata); sea rocket (Cakile edentula); seaside goldenrod (Solidago sempervirens); Japanese sedge or Asiatic sand sedge (Carex kobomugi); Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana); broom sedge (Andropogon virginicus); and short dune grass (Panicum amarum). For purposes of this ordinance, "coastal primary sand dune" shall not include any mound of sand, sandy soil, or dredge spoil deposited by any person for the purpose of temporary storage, beach replenishment or beach nourishment, nor shall the slopes of any such mound be used to determine the landward or lateral limits of a coastal primary sand dune.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Commission" means the Virginia Marine Resources Commission.
       </p>
       <p>

     City proper defendant in suit over denial of development permit.

    - City was proper defendant in suit over application of city ordinance regulating the use and development of coastal primary sand dunes. That the city adopted the ordinance to implement state policy and that the city's denial of a development permit to plaintiff was reviewed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission does not change the denial of the permit into state action.

    - Denial by city of a permit required by city's coastal primary sand dune zoning ordinance to develop two lots did not constitute a regulatory taking requiring compensation of landowner where the ordinance predated landowner's acquisition of the property; "bundle of rights" acquired by landowner when he acquired the property did not include the right to develop land without restriction.

    The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at least thirty days' notice to the affected person of the hearing's time, place, and purpose, and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the Commission or board.

       Whenever any privately owned land in any of such counties is to be transferred, and the transferor or the transferee requests clarification as to whether any portion of such land is claimed by the Commonwealth as ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, the Commission shall review the matter, and, if it determines that all or any portion of such land constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, the Commission shall file an amended or supplemental inventory as it may deem appropriate. Any such amended or supplemental inventory shall be filed in the same offices as the initial inventory for such area. The Commission shall not prepare or file any such amended or supplemental inventory unless (1) such classification is requested by a transferor or transferee as provided herein, or (2) (a) the federal government has asserted title to any ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands excluding the Wallops Island Naval/Aegis facility and all land adjacent thereto lying to the south that is used for a federal National Wildlife Refuge, (b) both the Governor and Attorney General concur in writing that all or any of the property to which the federal government has asserted title constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands, and (c) such amended or supplemental inventory only asserts the Commonwealth's title to the portion of such property that constitutes ungranted shores of the sea, marsh or meadowlands as concurred in by the Governor and the Attorney General.
