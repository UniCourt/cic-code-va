         Mechanic's lien is a statutory lien for bankruptcy purposes.
        </b>
        - The law of Virginia and the bankruptcy code, given their plain meaning and considered together, make clear that a mechanics' lien is properly considered to be a statutory lien so that it falls within the exception from a bankruptcy trustee's power to avoid preferences. Concrete Structures, Inc. v. Tidewater Crane and Rigging Co. (In re Concrete Structures, Inc.), 261 Bankr. 627, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3675 (E.D. Va. 2001).

       <p>
        <b>
         A mechanic's lien must be based on a contract,
        </b>
        either oral or written, with which it must conform: although the lien is a creature of the statute, it must have its foundation in a contract. Hence it must correspond with the contract, as has been decided by other courts in analogous cases upon statutes similar to ours. United States v. 5.382 Acres, 871 F. Supp. 880 (W.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 61 F.3d 901 (4th Cir. 1995).

        <b>
         Though it is analogous to common-law vendor's lien.
        </b>
        - The lien is created by performing labor on, or furnishing materials used for the construction of, a building or structure. It is analogous to the common-law vendor's lien, binding the building and the enhanced value of the freehold created by its construction. Kinnier Co. v. Cofer, 13 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 238 (1927).

         Policy.
        </b>
        - In enacting the mechanics' liens statute, Virginia has enunciated its policy consideration that materialmen and suppliers should be paid or have the recourse of lodging a lien against the property. In re Thomas A. Cary, Inc., 412 F. Supp. 667 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd sub nom. National Permanent Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v.

         Intent of section.
        </b>
        - This section, authorizing a lien upon a building or structure and the land therewith necessary for use and enjoyment of the premises for labor performed and material furnished in construction, is intended to give those who have enhanced the value of a building the security of a lien on it to the extent they have added value but not to give a lien upon property not benefitted by labor or materials. This policy becomes particularly important when interests of other claimants are impinged upon by a joint lien. United Masonry, Inc. v. Jefferson Mews, Inc.,
        <cite class="va_code">
         218 Va. 360

       </p>
       <p>
        The mechanics' lien is designed to give security to those adding value to property, by a pledge of the interest of the employer. Merchants &amp; Mechanics Sav. Bank v. Dashiell, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 616 (1874); Bristol Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Thomas,

       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the law is to give to those who, by their labor and material, have enhanced the value of a building or structure the security of a lien thereon to the extent that they have added to its value, but not to give a lien upon property not benefitted. Gilman v. Ryan,

         Construction of chapter.
        </b>
        - Although there is a diversity of opinion as to whether mechanics' lien statutes should receive a strict or liberal construction, the correct rule of construction as to this chapter is that there must be a substantial compliance with the requirement of that portion of the chapter which relates to the creation of the lien, but that the provisions with respect to its enforcement should be liberally construed. H.N. Francis &amp; Co. v. Hotel Rueger, Inc.,

       <p>
        The remedial portions of this chapter, which provide for enforcing the mechanics' lien after it is perfected, should be liberally construed, but the other portions, upon which the right to the existence of the lien depends, being in derogation of the common law, should be strictly construed.

         Unless interests of other lien creditors are prejudiced.

        - The release of a portion of the properties embraced by the lien may preclude its successful assertion against the remainder. This is only true where the interest of other lien creditors are affected; it would not be so in the case of the owner and the lienor. If it were not so the mechanics' lien lienors could so shift their liens as to burden unduly some of the lien subjects and to relieve others, to the extent of imperiling the interests of other lien creditors, which would not be consonant with the intent and spirit of this chapter and would be offensive to good conscience and equity.

        Where lienor failed to perfect the lien upon one of the lots of a subdivision he sought to encumber, and where the chancellor released the lien as to that lot, this shifted the full burden of the lienor's claim to the remaining lots. But, when such a shift in the burden occurs, the lien is enforceable only when there were no third persons whose interests were injuriously affected by the shift, and here the secured creditor under deed of trust had a valuable interest in the lots; thus, the chancellor erred in overruling the creditor's demurrer to the lienor's bill of complaint to enforce the lien.

        - Subcontractors' liens, which were directed toward an association of condominium owners, were valid despite the fact that the liens included some 40 units that were considered public property and owned by the county because the 940 unreleased unit owners did not suffer a shift in the lien burden from the 40 released units; instead, the percentage of indebtedness had already been apportioned, and it remained apportioned in the same amount.

         Legislative intent.

        - Recognizing that 150-day limitation period might necessitate that claimant file multiple liens during the course of a construction project, the legislature specifically authorized the filing of "any number of memoranda." Therefore, a correct application of the statutory 150-day limitation period does not render meaningless the 90-day filing limitation, but instead comports with the legislature's desire to prevent undisclosed or inchoate liens.

         Purpose and character of description of property.

        - The object of requiring a description of the property is to inform the owner upon which part of his property the lien is claimed, and to give notice thereof to purchasers and creditors, so that they may identify the property and protect themselves against the lien.

        A memorandum of mechanic's lien must contain "a brief description of the property" on which the lien is claimed. The purpose of the description is to enable an owner, purchaser, or creditor to identify the property on which the lien is claimed.

         Failure to perfect mechanic's lien.

        - In a mechanic's lien dispute, a general contractor was not a necessary party to a subcontractor's lien enforcement action because it did not have a pecuniary interest since it was neither the principal nor the surety on the bond, and it had no ability to be awarded a judgment to be paid out from the bond. The general contractor failed to perfect its mechanic's lien on the real estate because it did not file a "memorandum of lien" and "a certification of mailing of a copy of the memorandum" of lien to the owner of the property in the county clerk's office; the lien was lost as a result.

        , is that generally the extent of the liability of an owner to a subcontractor or subcontractors is limited to the amount in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time notice to the owner is given by the subcontractor or subcontractors. This policy likely found its source in what is known as the "New York System," under which the lien of a subcontractor or materialman depends on, and is limited by, the amount remaining due the general contractor at or subsequent to notice by the subcontractor served on the owner.

        - The intent of the provision "But the amount for which a subcontractor may perfect a lien under this section shall not exceed the amount in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time the notice is given," was to limit the owner's liability to the contract price of the building subject to any payments made to the general contractor for labor and materials furnished and used as its construction progressed; but the owner cannot deprive subcontractors of the lien given them by this chapter by giving to the general contractor, in payment for labor and materials, his personal obligation, evidenced by his negotiable notes.

       <p>
        When the owner gives the general contractor his notes for the purpose of raising money to secure labor and purchase material for the construction of a building, and the general contractor negotiates the notes to a person who knows their purpose, it seems that this section gives the holder notice of the rights of the subcontractors, and he is bound to see to the application of the proceeds of the notes. He cannot accept the notes in discharge of an antecedent debt of the general contractor. Kinnier Co. v. Cofer, 13 Va. L. Reg. (n.s.) 238 (1927).

         Retention of percentage by owner for owner's benefit alone.
        </b>
        - The reservation by the owner of a percentage of the cost of construction of a building until its completion, with the right to supply any deficiency and deduct the cost from any money due or to become due under the contract, is for the benefit of the owner alone, and not for subcontractors who may be thereafter employed. Thus the amount of a subcontractor's lien cannot be determined by the amount of the reserved sum, where orders drawn upon the owner by the general contractor in favor of subcontractors were paid by the owner before the lien in question was perfected, notwithstanding the fact that, under the terms of the contract, the reserved sum was not due and payable to the general contractor until after the date on which the lien was perfected.

        - Where owner asserted that debt arose under a separate oral contract for work which did not include work performed by subcontractors, the evidence reflected that these subcontractors provided goods both for the construction of the sewer outfall and for Section 1 work. More importantly, considering (1) the lack of differentiation between the two contracts in the record-keeping methods utilized by the owner and general contractor, (2) the subcontractors' lack of knowledge and control over the allocation of goods and services to a specific contract, and (3) the language in the release for both the sewer outfall and Section 1 payments that materials were provided for "the utilities for the entire subdivision," the trial court did not err in holding that there was only one contract as to the owner and the subcontractors and that owner failed to establish its affirmative defense of full or partial payment to the subcontractor's lien.

       - If a materialman fails to perfect a mechanics' lien on the building into which his materials are placed, the amount due him therefor by a subcontractor is a general unsecured debt due to the materialman, and upon the bankruptcy of the subcontractor, the amount due him by the general contractor passes to his trustee as assets of the bankrupt.

       Deduction of obligation owner required to incur to complete building.
       
       - While it is true that under this section the owner, under certain conditions, may be made personally liable to a subcontractor, yet this liability is not permitted to exceed the sum in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time he receives notice of the mechanics' lien, and such indebtedness excludes the obligation the owner may have been required to incur in order to complete the building, so that what remains in the owner's hands after deducting such an obligation is applicable to the liens of the subcontractors, under this section.

     <p>
      Any contractor or subcontractor or any officer, director or employee of such contractor or subcontractor who shall, with intent to defraud, retain or use the funds, or any part thereof, paid by the owner or his agent, the contractor, or the lender to such contractor or by the owner or his agent, the contractor, or the lender to a subcontractor under any contract for the construction, removal, repair, or improvement of any building or structure permanently annexed to the freehold for any other purpose than to pay persons performing labor upon or furnishing material for such construction, repair, removal, or improvement is guilty of larceny in appropriating such funds for any other use while any amount for which the contractor or subcontractor may be liable or become liable under his contract for such labor or materials remains unpaid and may be prosecuted upon complaint of any person or persons who have not been fully paid any amount due them.
     </p>
     <p>
      The use by any such contractor or subcontractor or any officer, director, or employee of such contractor or subcontractor of any moneys paid under the contract before paying all amounts due or to become due for labor performed or material furnished for such building or structure for any other purpose than paying such amounts due on the project shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. Any breach or violation of this section may give rise to a civil cause of action for a party in contract with the general contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate; however, this right does not affect a contractor's or subcontractor's right to withhold payment for failure to properly perform labor or furnish materials on the project. Any contract or subcontract provision that allows a contracting party to withhold funds due under one contract or subcontract for alleged claims or damages due on another contract or subcontract is void as against public policy.

        This section is a criminal statute.
       </b>
       This statute extends the definition of larceny in Virginia beyond the traditional common law meaning.
       Specifically, this section determines that a contractor's use of funds for a purpose other than to pay the provider of materials is prima facie evidence of larceny.
       The purpose of the statute is to punish fraud; prosecution of a contractor for violating this code section does not affect the debt itself. Builders Supply Co. v. Lane, 115 Bankr. 81 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1990).

        Larceny found.

       - Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for larceny because it was defendant's duty, as a general contractor retained to build a home, to use the funds received by defendant from the buyers of the home for the payment of subcontractor and supplier accounts before using them for any other purpose. However, defendant's failure to provide an accounting for the funds that the buyers paid defendant constituted prima facie evidence of intent to defraud, but defendant was unable to produce evidence to the contrary.

        Surety who completes contract does not take priority over lienors.
       </b>
       - Where a surety under its contract of suretyship, upon default of its principal, a building contractor, completes the contract, the surety's relation to the owner is identical with that of the original contractor, and in such a case it is the right as well as the duty of the owner to prevent any diversion of the funds from those who had perfected statutory liens upon the structure. Their right to have their liens discharged out of the unpaid balance in the hands of the owner is as clear against the surety as it would have been against the contractor principal.

If the owner completes the building and shows that the cost of doing so has exhausted the fund, the liens of the subcontractors would be wiped out under the express terms of this section. But where the owner did not complete the building and did not offer any evidence as to the cost of completion, there was no evidence that the owner had any setoff or counterclaims against the funds which he was withholding from the general contractor.

       over other liens. When another lien or encumbrance is created before the work is commenced or the materials furnished it does not operate on the building until the mechanics' lien is satisfied; if created after the work is commenced or the materials furnished it does not operate on the land or building until the mechanics' lien is satisfied.

       - Fact that a deed of trust was recorded prior to delivery of some of the building materials provided by a supplier had no effect on the priority of the supplier's mechanics' lien as to those materials vis-a-vis those previously delivered; all of the materials supplied for the construction had the same lien priority as the materials supplied on the first day regardless of intervening liens.

      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, when the Small Business Administration has joined a private bank in making a construction loan secured by a recorded deed of trust and the borrower becomes insolvent, the SBA's interest in the unpaid balance of the loan is not subordinate to mechanics' liens accorded priority over deeds of trust by state law.

        Effect of filing and recording against claim of United States.
       </b>
       - As against claim of United States, the interim steps of filing and recording the lien, without obtaining a final judgment enforcing the lien against the property, serve "merely as a caveat of a more perfect lien to come."

       </b>
       - If the owner of the full equitable estate in land causes buildings to be erected thereon, for the cost of which a mechanic records a lien, such lien, by the terms of this section, takes priority, as to both land and buildings, over all liens thereafter acquired on the land, and also over all judgments thereafter recovered against the equitable owner's grantor, who holds the mere legal title to the land. If the mechanics' lien has been enforced by the sale of the property, the purchaser has the right to stand in the shoes of the mechanic before the sale. Pace v. Moorman,

     <p>
      The liens created and perfected under this chapter may be enforced in a court of equity by a bill filed in the county or city wherein the building, structure, or railroad, or some part thereof is situated, or wherein the owner, or if there be more than one, any of them, resides. The plaintiff shall file with his bill an itemized statement of his account, showing the amount and character of the work done or materials furnished, the prices charged therefor, the payments made, if any, the balance due, and the time from which interest is claimed thereon, the correctness of which account shall be verified by the affidavit of himself, or his agent. When suit is brought for the enforcement of any such lien against the property bound thereby, all parties entitled to such liens upon the property or any portion thereof may file petitions in such suit asking for the enforcement of their respective liens to have the same effect as if an independent suit were brought by each claimant.

        Purpose of 1976 amendment.
       </b>
       - When the General Assembly amended this section by substituting the words "with intent to mislead" for the word "knowingly," the amendment did not constitute a substantive change in the statute. Rather, the amendment was enacted simply to reinforce the original legislative intent by clarifying an after-discovered semantical ambiguity. Prior to the amendment, "knowingly" meant more than "with knowledge." Rather, "knowingly" in this context was an antonym of "innocently" and a synonym of "designedly" and "with intent to mislead."

        Forfeiture not warranted.

       - The act of a subcontractor in including in his memorandum of mechanic's lien debts due on projects other than the project in question did not constitute a forfeiture of the subcontractor's right to a mechanic's lien under this section where the statement of account filed prior to the memorandum contained data which corresponded fully with invoices and with the amount claimed in memorandum and where no evidence of an intent to mislead was produced.

        Beneficiary of antecedent deed of trust entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge.

         Section applies only to companies strictly engaged in businesses named.
        </b>
        - The legislature, in placing railroad, canal and other transportation companies and mining and manufacturing companies all in one section, plainly had in mind corporations extensive in character, and at least those actually and chiefly so engaged, and not such as might incidentally, from a technical viewpoint, be engaged partially in manufacturing something used, or capable of being used, in connection with the business in hand. "Mining or manufacturing companies" in this section manifestly was intended to apply to companies strictly engaged in the businesses named, which considered along with other portions of the section applicable to railroad, canal, and other transportation companies, clearly indicated the actual engaging in one of the five things named in the section, to wit, operating a railroad, canal, or transportation company, or a mining or manufacturing business.

The first proceeds of sale were to go to their advances, then all charges were to be deducted, and, after an account for these was made up, the iron company had a right to the net balance, if any. It was held that the title to the iron so shipped passed to the brokers and out of the iron company, and the iron did not constitute part of the personal property of the iron company so as to be subject to the lien conferred by this section.

        Time of filing memorandum is governed by date when claim matures.
       </b>
       - The time within which the memorandum must be filed is governed by the date when the claim matures; the date of furnishing the supplies is immaterial. If the claim is payable in installments, this section means that the memorandum must be filed within 90 days after the last installment is due. Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 56 F. 676 (E.D.

        But time is not extended by acceptance of note for wages.
       </b>
       - This section does not contemplate that a company may give its note, due 60 days or one or two years after date, for the amount due its laborer, and that then, when the note is due, 90 days shall be allowed thereafter in which to file a memorandum claiming a lien; it means that a claim for a lien shall be made within 90 days from the time the labor was performed - from the day the laborer was entitled to demand his wages. Liberty Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. v. M.A. Furbush &amp; Son Mach. Co., 80 F. 631 (4th Cir. 1897).

        And memorandum may be filed before claim becomes due.
       </b>
       - The language of this section, "within ninety days after the last item of his bill becomes due and payable," is not used to designate the beginning and the end of the period in which the memorandum may be filed, but to fix a period not later than or beyond which the memorandum cannot be filed. A lien claimant who has extended credit may file his memorandum from the time the supplies are furnished, although the term of credit has not expired. In re W. Norfolk Lumber Co., 112 F. 759 (E.D. Va. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Lien relates back to date supplies were furnished.
       </b>
       - The lien dates from the time of furnishing the supplies, and it may be claimed at any time after the supplies are furnished, whether the goods are sold for cash or on credit, provided the claim is filed not later than 90 days after the last item of the account becomes due and payable. If the claim is filed within that time, the lien secured relates back to the time the supplies were furnished. In re W. Norfolk Lumber Co., 112 F. 759 (E.D. Va. 1902).

      <p>
       <b>
        Time runs from last item of continuous contract.
       </b>
       - If the supplies are furnished under a single contract, and are in fulfillment thereof, the items of the account are continuous, and the lien claimant has 90 days from the due date of the last item within which to file his memorandum and perfect his lien. On the other hand, if the several items of the account, or a portion of them, are furnished under separate contracts, then the lien should be filed 90 days from the due date of the last item under each independent contract.

Shenandoah Iron Co., 35 F. 436 (C.C.W.D. Va. 1887); Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 56 F. 676 (E.D. Va. 1893); Fidelity Ins., Trust &amp; Safe-Deposit Co. v. Roanoke Iron Co., 81 F. 439 (W.D.

       § 43-33. Lien of mechanic for repairs.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every mechanic who shall alter or repair any article of personal property at the request of the owner of such property shall have a lien thereon for his just and reasonable charges therefor and may retain possession of such property until such charges are paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      And every mechanic who shall make necessary alterations or repairs on any article of personal property which from its character requires the making of ordinary repairs thereto as a reasonable incident to its reasonable and customary use, at the request of any person legally in possession thereof under a reservation of title contract, chattel mortgage, deed of trust, or other instrument securing money, the person so in possession having authority to use such property, shall have a lien thereon for his just and reasonable charges therefor to the extent of $1,000. In addition, such mechanic shall be entitled to a lien against the proceeds, if any, remaining after the satisfaction of all prior security interests or liens and may retain possession of such property until such charges are paid. In any action to enforce the lien hereby given all persons having an interest in the property sought to be subjected shall be made parties defendant.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the owner of the property held by the mechanic shall desire to obtain possession thereof, he shall make the mechanic defendant in proceeding in the county or municipal court to recover the property.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner may give a bond payable to the court, in a penalty of the amount equal to the lien claimed by the mechanic and court costs, with security to be approved by the clerk, and conditioned for the performance of the final judgment of the court on the trial of the proceeding, and with a further condition to the effect that, if upon the hearing, the judgment of the court be that the lien of the mechanic on such property, or any part thereof, be enforced, judgment may thereupon be entered against the obligors on such bond for the amount due the mechanic and court costs, if assessed against the owner, without further or other proceedings against them thereon. Upon giving of the bond, the property shall be delivered to the owner.

      and any bailee, except where otherwise provided, having a lien as such at common law on personal property in his possession that he has no power to sell for the satisfaction of the lien, if the debt for which the lien exists is not paid within 10 days after it is due and the value of the property affected by the lien does not exceed $10,000, may sell such property or so much thereof as may be necessary, by public auction, for cash. The proceeds shall be applied to the satisfaction of the debt and expenses of sale, and the surplus, if any, shall be paid within 30 days of the sale to any lienholder, and then to the owner of the property. A seller who fails to remit the surplus as provided shall be liable to the person entitled to the surplus in an amount equal to $50 for each day beyond 30 days that the failure continues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before making the sale, the seller shall advertise the time, place, and terms thereof in any of the following places: (i) a public place in the county or city where the property is located; (ii) a website operated by the Commonwealth, the county or city where the property is located, or a political subdivision of either; or (iii) a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the property is located, either in print or on its website. In the case of property other than a motor vehicle required to be registered in Virginia having a value in excess of $600, 10 days' prior notice shall be given to any secured party who has filed a financing statement against the property, and written notice shall be given to the owner as hereinafter provided.

     <p>
      If the value of the property is more than $10,000 but does not exceed $25,000, the party having the lien, after giving notice as herein provided, may apply by petition to any general district court of the county or city wherein the property is, or, if the value of the property exceeds $25,000, to the circuit court of the county or city, for the sale of the property. If, on the hearing of the case on the petition, the defense, if any made thereto, and such evidence as may be adduced by the parties respectively, the court is satisfied that the debt and lien are established and the property should be sold to pay the debt, the court shall order the sale to be made by the sheriff of the county or city. The sheriff shall make the same and apply and dispose of the proceeds in the same manner as if the sale were made under a writ of fieri facias.

The "bonding off" process substituted the bond for the real estate and, under those circumstances, it made no difference whether the property owner remained a nominal party or was released from the lawsuit.

       , the subcontractor was required to commence its action to enforce its lien within six months from the time the lien was recorded. Because more than six months had passed, the subcontractor was time-barred from amending its complaint to add the general contractor as a party to the subcontractor's suit on bond.

       - Once a mechanic's lien on an owner's property was released by the posting of a bond, the owner's property interest could not be defeated or diminished by the underlying breach of construction contract litigation. The "bonding off" process substituted the bond for the real estate and, under those circumstances, it made no difference whether the property owner remained a nominal party or was released from the lawsuit. Trident Elec., Inc. v. John S. Clark, Inc.,, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 5 (Roanoke County Feb. 8, 2008).

       Because the bond did not absolve the general contractor from liability to the subcontractor, the general contractor retained an immediate interest in resisting the demand made in the suit on bond; Thus, the general contractor was a necessary party to the subcontractor's suit.
