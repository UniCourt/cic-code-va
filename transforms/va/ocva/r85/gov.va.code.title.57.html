        § 57-1. Act for religious freedom recited.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       The General Assembly, on January 16, 1786, passed an act in the following words:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Whereas, Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishment, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, have established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical, and even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards which, proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labors, for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a natural right; that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though, indeed, those are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet, neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he, being of course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rules of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere, when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail, if left to herself; that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested or burthened, in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies constituted with powers equal to our own, and that, therefore, to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind; and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right."

     History and effect of statute.
    </b>
    - The Statute of Charitable Trusts, St. 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, passed to make good conveyances to pious uses, not otherwise good, and relating to the administration of such trusts by the courts of equity, was repealed by the legislature of Virginia in 1792. See Fitzgerald v. Doggett's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 112</cite>, 155 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 129</cite> (1930).
        </p>
        <p>
         The history of this section begins with Acts 1839, p. 11. Triplett v. Trotter, <cite class="va_code">169 Va. 440</cite>, 193 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 514</cite> (1937).
        </p>
        <p>
         By the act of April 2, 1839, concerning devises and bequests made to schools, etc., and the Act of 1840-41, Code, c. 80,
         §
         2, a devise to a school which was void at common law was made valid, though it had not been reported to the General Assembly, as directed by
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         7 of said first act, and no act had been passed incorporating the institution. Kelly v. Love's Adm'r, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 124 (1870).
        </p>
        <p>
         By the 2nd section, c. 80, of the Code of 1860, the legislature relinquished the right, previously reserved to the State, of determining whether it would or would not accept the devises and bequests for literary purposes made since 1839; and declared its pleasure to be, that all such devises and bequests should be valid, except those only which had become void by the provisions of the 7th section of that act. This legislation operated as a general act of acceptance in all cases, and instead of a special acceptance in each particular case. The heirs could not complain of such legislation, as it took nothing from them; their rights having been already divested under the provisions of the 1st section of the act of 1839. Kelly v. Love's Adm'r, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 124 (1870).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section as amended in 1914 validated indefinite charitable bequests or devises, whether made to a body corporate or unincorporated, or to a natural person. Fitzgerald v. Doggett's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 112</cite>, 155 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 129</cite> (1930).

        <p>
         The Maryland case of Fletcher v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., 193 Md. 400, 67 A.2d 386 (1949), stands for the proposition that the general validating act of 1914 established the doctrine of judicial cy pres in Virginia. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         Virginia would, in any appropriate case pertaining to a trust coming into existence after 1914, apply judicial cy pres. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (E.D. Va. 1963), modified, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     There was a time when charitable bequests were not valid.
    </b>
    But this section and others have given life to such bequests. The attainment of this desired end was in the power of the legislature. Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 1138</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 565 (1954).
    <br />

        </p>
        <p>
         Under this section every devise made for charitable purposes is just as valid as a devise made to a certain natural person or for his benefit. Moore v. Downham, <cite class="va_code">166 Va. 77</cite>, 184 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 199</cite> (1936); Thomas v. Bryant, <cite class="va_code">185 Va. 845</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 487 (1946).
        </p>
        <p>
         On its face this section has no effect other than to save some charitable trusts which would otherwise fail because the trustee is not a certain, natural person. Smith v. Moore, 343 F.2d 594 (4th Cir. 1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     The legislature did not exceed its power in making charitable bequests valid
    </b>
    by the enactment of this and related sections. Roller v. Shaver, <cite class="va_code">178 Va. 467</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 419 (1941).

         <b>
     Religious donations are not affected by this section,

        </p>
        <p>
         This section deals primarily with charitable trusts for literary and educational purposes. It could hardly be the intent of the legislature, in the use of the words "charitable purposes," as set forth in this section, to remove all restrictions upon trusts for religious purposes without specifically amending other sections of the Code dealing with that subject. Moore v. Perkins, <cite class="va_code">169 Va. 175</cite>, 192 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 806</cite> (1937).

     Meaning of persons "within this State."
    </b>
    - This former provision of this section, validating a gift for the education of white and colored persons "within this State," meant that the institution itself should be located in Virginia, and not that the beneficiaries of such gift should be confined to residents of this State. Triplett v. Trotter, <cite class="va_code">169 Va. 440</cite>, 193 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 514</cite> (1937).

         <b>
     Devise to trustee to be disposed of for charitable purposes is valid.
    </b>
    - Where the residuary clause devised the residue of testatrix' property to the executor and trustee, to be disposed of for charitable purposes to such associations, corporations or individuals as he deemed proper, it was held that the devise was made valid by this section. The devise was not invalid because of the contingency that the trustee might refuse to act, since former
    
     §§
    
    55-27 through 55-29 and 26-54 [see now Uniform Trust Code,
    <span class="s1">

     And gift to "worthy and dependent young men" is valid.
    </b>
    - A gift by will to establish and maintain a college for the education of such "worthy and dependent young men" as may be selected by a board of trustees designated or provided for in the will, and as the income of the trust will permit, is on its face a valid gift for educational purposes under this section. Triplett v. Trotter, <cite class="va_code">169 Va. 440</cite>, 193 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 514</cite> (1937).

         <b>
     A gift of trust funds "to some strictly charitable organization of continued and proven service,"

         <b>
     Unincorporated association named as trustee.
    </b>
    - In the instant case testatrix clearly expressed the purpose she had in view, namely, the creating of a trust for the benefit of a certain class of old, or enfeebled, preachers. She believed that she had indicated a trustee, but failed to do so, because she did not in the will clearly identify the party intended, and if the witnesses who testified are correct that she named the Conference Board of Finance, an unincorporated society, then she had named an incompetent trustee. It was held that the trust was valid under this section and the power for the enforcement of the trust was provided by former
    
     §§
    
    55-27 and 55-28. Fitzgerald v. Doggett's Ex'r, <cite class="va_code">155 Va. 112</cite>, 155 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 129</cite> (1930).

          Failure of agency provided for effecting bequest.
         </b>
         - Where a devise was made to the former Board of the Literary Fund (a corporation created by law) and their successors forever, in trust for the benefit of the County of Albemarle, for the purpose of establishing and supporting a manual labor school, to be conducted through the agency of the county court of Albemarle, the agencies appointed for carrying out the bequest were but a secondary consideration with the testator; and the object being consistent with the Constitution and laws, the devise and bequest will be held to be valid, though the agencies existing at the time of the bequest or the death of the testator have been changed. Kinnaird v. Miller's Ex'r, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 107 (1874).
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
     Failure to define purpose of trust.
    </b>
    - It was held that where the testator totally failed to define the purpose to which the fund was to be applied, the bequest was not embraced in the validating provisions of this section, and this section had no application. Massanetta Springs Summer Bible Conference Encampment v. Keezell, <cite class="va_code">161 Va. 532</cite>, 171 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 511</cite> (1933).

     Trust held not vague and indefinite.
    </b>
    - Where it appeared that the testator, in 1880, bequeathed money to be invested by a fiduciary, giving ample security, in safe interest-bearing funds, the interest only to be applied to the use of his legatee during her life, and at her death, "the principal and any unexpected interest to be paid to the Protestant Episcopal Education Society of Virginia" (incorporated in 1875), "said bequest to be used exclusively for educating poor young men for the Episcopal ministry, upon the basis of evangelical principles as now established," it was held that the bequest to the legatee corporation is not null and void, because not absolute for its own use as a corporate body, but in trust to be exclusively used for the trusts therein named, and because those trusts are religious in their character, and too vague and indefinite to be upheld under the law of this State, or to be administered by a court of chancery.

     Constructive trust imposed on congregation's property.
    </b>
    - Equity dictated that a constructive trust be imposed on the property of a congregation for the benefit of a diocese and a national church as: (1) the Dennis Canon codified in explicit terms a trust relationship that had been implicit in the relationship between local parishes and dioceses since the founding of the national church; (2) the congregation had affirmatively assented to the constitution and canons of the national church and agreed to be benefited and bound by every rule and canon that was to be framed by any convention acting under the church's constitution; (3) the congregation, the diocese and the national church intended, agreed and expected that the property would be held in trust by the congregation as trustee for the benefit of the national church; and (4) the congregation's attempt to withdraw from the diocese and the national church and still maintain the property violated its fiduciary obligation to the church. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, <cite class="va_code">285 Va. 651</cite>, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constructive trust was imposed under
    
     §
    
    57-10 on the personal property of a congregation, including any contributions or donations or payments of membership dues, in favor of a diocese and a national church as
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    57-7.1 explicitly applied to every conveyance or transfer of real or personal property; the fact that the national church and the diocese granted the congregation discretion as to how it distributed any contributions or donations it received did not change the fact that such contributions and donations were held in trust for the benefit of the diocese and the national church. The congregation's evidence of its vestry's statement was insufficient to show the donative intent of the congregants. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, <cite class="va_code">285 Va. 651</cite>, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L.

     Mode of transfer.
    </b>
    - This section clearly covers any mode of voluntary transfer of personal estate, whether inter vivos or testamentary. No limitation or restriction as to the manner of effecting such voluntary transfers is in any way indicated by this section. Maguire v. Loyd, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 138</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 885 (1951), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 266</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 631 (1952).

     This section places no limitation upon gifts, grants, and bequests of personal property
    </b>
    to churches, except as provided in
    
     §
    
    57-12 (repealed in 2003). Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 1138</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 565 (1954).

       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Will need not show use and purpose of gift.
    </b>
    - A bequest to a church is not invalid because the will does not show the use and purpose of the gift. This section takes care of the situation when the object and purpose of a gift to a religious congregation are indefinite or uncertain. Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, <cite class="va_code">195 Va. 1138</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 565 (1954).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Thus, no implied trusts for supercongregational churches may be upheld.
    </b>
    - As express trusts for supercongregational churches are invalid under Virginia law no implied trusts for such denominations may be upheld. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 500</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 752 (1974).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     How trust to be administered.
    </b>
    - There is nothing in the language of this section to prevent a settlor from creating a trust for the benefit of a church or religious congregation and specifically providing the manner in which the trust corpus is to be administered. Maguire v. Loyd, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 138</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 885 (1951), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 266</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 631 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not specifically require that all trusts be administered in the manner provided by it, irrespective of the wishes and desires of the settlor as expressed in the instrument creating the trust. Maguire v. Loyd, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 138</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 885 (1951), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 266</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 631 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        A settlor in creating a religious trust undoubtedly, in many instances, has good and sufficient reasons for designating individual or corporate trustees to administer the trust for the benefit of a church or religious congregation, and there is nothing in this section to prevent him from doing that, subject to the limitations of
    
     §
    
    57-12 (repealed in 2003). Maguire v. Loyd, <cite class="va_code">193 Va. 138</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 885 (1951), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="va_code">194 Va. 266</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 631 (1952).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Date of separation.
    </b>
    - Trial court erred in determining that the date that the diocese filed its declaratory judgment action against a congregation was the proper demarcation point in determining when a congregation became a separate entity such that donations and contributions it received belonged to the congregation; the date the congregation voted to disaffiliate with the diocese and the national church or the date the diocese declared that the property was abandoned was the proper demarcation point. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, <cite class="va_code">285 Va. 651</cite>, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449 (2014).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         A deed conveying property in trust for the use of the local society is not without the operation of this section
        </b>
        by reason that it sanctions the appointment of the ministers and authorizes them to use the house for preaching, without any reference to the vote or wish of the congregation, it being a Methodist church and the ministers to be appointed by the conference, according to the constitutions of that church. Brooke v. Shacklett, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 301 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         What deeds are not within the influence of section.
        </b>
        - No deed which does not respect the rights of the local society or religious congregation, and no deed which does not design the enjoyment of the uses of the property conveyed by the local religious society or congregation can be placed within the influence of the statute. Brooke v. Shacklett, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 301 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Devise for specific purpose.
    </b>
    - While a church cannot take real estate by devise, if property be devised to a church for a specific, definite, legal purpose, such as the erection of a memorial to a deceased relative, the church is not the beneficiary but a bare trustee, and the devise is valid. St. Stephen's Episcopal Church v. Norris' Adm'r, <cite class="va_code">115 Va. 225</cite>, 78 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 622</cite> (1913).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     Conveyance of property later used as minister's residence.
    </b>
    - A conveyance to trustees for a religious association was valid, since after the deed was executed the property was used for church purposes; namely, as the residence of a minister. And, the conveyance being valid, the heirs at law of the grantor had no interest in the property and were not proper parties to object that it was not being used for permitted purposes at the time of the suit. This was a matter with which the Commonwealth alone was concerned. Anderson v. Richardson, <cite class="va_code">200 Va. 1</cite>, 104 S.E.2d 5 (1958).
    <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
     But civil courts are not powerless to prevent a hierarchical church from being deprived of contractual rights in church property

    held by trustees of a local congregation. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 500</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 752 (1974).

        <b>
     Representative of hierarchical church has burden of proof.
    </b>
    - As the hierarchical church cannot rely on the implied trust theory, the representative of the hierarchical church has the burden of proving that the trustees of the congregation have violated either the express language of the deeds or a contractual obligation to the general church.

     Purpose of statute.

    - Clear purpose of subsection A of
    
     §
    
    57-9 is to provide a method by which the disputed title to and control of any property held in trust for a congregation may be conclusively determined. The "church or religious society" referenced in the statute in which a "division" has occurred contemplates one that has an interest in the property for which the title and control is at issue.

     Construction.
    </b>
    - Proper construction of the language of subsection A of
    
     §
    
    57-9 must take into account the interrelationship of the words being considered. Thus, in order to determine whether a congregation is entitled to petition for the relief afforded by subsection A, as a prerequisite the congregation must show that there has been a division in a church or religious society to which any such congregation is attached. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, <cite class="va_code">280 Va. 6</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority afforded by subsection A permitting congregations to vote in order to determine to which branch of a church or religious society such congregation shall thereafter belong must be construed within the context of the first phrase of the statute. That is, the branch of the church or society to which the congregation votes to belong must be a branch of the church or religious society to which the petitioning congregation is attached prior to the division. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, <cite class="va_code">280 Va. 6</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proper construction of subsection A required a petitioning congregation to establish both that there had been a division within the church or religious society to which it was attached and that subsequent to that division the congregation sought to affiliate with a branch derived from that same church or religious society.

Even under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:8's liberal standard for allowing leave to amend pleadings, allowing leave to amend in the present case would be improper because the diocese had not previously raised the affirmative defense of waiver, the diocese had already long ago forced the congregations to defend against the claim that the statute had not been properly invoked and was not constitutional, and the diocese was trying to claim through its "clarification" that the statute did not apply at all.

     When ecclesiastical court allowed to intervene in church property transfer.
    </b>
    - Where the congregation of a local church, contrary to ecclesiastical law, undertook unilaterally to withdraw with its property from the parent church, which was a supercongregational body, the first ecclesiastical court having direct jurisdiction over the local church should have been allowed to intervene in a conveyance of church property by the trustees of the local church to a day school if it was established that the ecclesiastical court had a property interest in the local church's property, since the trial court's approval of the conveyance sought by the trustees would have unlawfully deprived the ecclesiastical court of this property interest. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 500</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 752 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ecclesiastical court was entitled to present whatever evidence it had tending to establish its interest in the congregation's property, and if the ecclesiastical court had established a proprietary interest, it would have been entitled to a permanent injunction against the conveyance by the trustees to the day school. If, however, the ecclesiastical court was unable to establish a proprietary interest in the property, it would have had no standing to object to the property transfer. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, <cite class="va_code">214 Va. 500</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 752 (1974).

        § 57-17. Conveyance of church land held in adverse possession.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Whenever any church in the Commonwealth has been in the undisputed possession, for a period of 25 years or more, of any real estate, and for which there is no deed of record, the church, after giving notice once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in, or having general circulation in, the county or city in which such real estate is, may file a petition in the circuit court of such county, or any court of record of such city, duly sworn to, which petition shall set forth the fact that the real estate mentioned therein has been in the undisputed possession of such church for a period of 25 years or more and shall give the true boundaries of such real estate. Upon the hearing of such petition, if the court shall be satisfied that the real estate mentioned has been in the undisputed possession of such church for a period of 25 years or more; that the boundaries mentioned in the petition are the true boundaries of such real estate; and that such petition has been filed by the proper party, it may appoint a special commissioner to make conveyance of such real estate to the church, with covenant of special warranty.

        - Phrase "and for which there is no deed of record," as well as the prepositional phrase before it, "for a period of twenty-five years or more," both appear to describe the antecedent noun, "possession"; construing the statute accordingly, it is a church's possession, not the real estate itself, for which there being "no deed of record" necessitates a conveyance. In re Conveyance of the United House of Prayer for All People of the Church on the Rock of the Apostolic Faith, 102 Va. Cir. 109, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 88 (Chesapeake Apr. 24, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Heading of the statute, "conveyance of church land held in adverse possession," suggests that the statute applies where a church's possession is adverse to the record title owner of the land; if there were no deed for the land anywhere in the land records, there would be no owner to whom a church's possession is adverse, and the legislature appears to have contemplated that the land was owned of record prior to coming into a church's possession.

      <p>
       The owner of any land on which is located a previously unidentified graveyard or an abandoned family graveyard, and there has been no reservation of rights in such graveyard, or when the beneficiaries of any reservations of rights desire to waive such rights, and in which no body has been interred for twenty-five years may file a bill in equity in the circuit court of the county or in the circuit or corporation court wherein such land is located for the purpose of having the remains interred in such graveyard removed to some more suitable repository. To such bill all persons in interest, known or unknown, other than the plaintiffs shall be duly made defendants. If any of such parties be unknown, the plaintiffs shall undertake active, good faith efforts to locate interested parties including, at a minimum, publication of at least one notice in a local newspaper of general circulation, notice posted at the site of the graveyard, and notice to and consultation with any historic preservation or other such commission, as well as area historical and genealogical societies. In addition, the plaintiff is encouraged to post such notice on the Internet, including appropriate websites and through the use of social media, and to consult with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Upon the case being properly matured for hearing, and proof being made of the propriety of the removal, the court may order the removal made and the remains properly deposited in another place, at the expense of the petitioner. Such removal and reinterment shall be done with due care and decency.

To such bill all owners of the graveyard or any person having a right therein, and in the case of a pauper's graveyard the dedicator thereof, his heirs or successors in interest, if known, and if not known, such unknown parties shall be made defendants by the name of "person or persons unknown who may be the owners, heirs, or successors in interest of the unknown dedicator of the pauper's graveyard which is the subject of this suit," other than the plaintiffs shall be duly made defendants.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bill shall show the title of the land, the interest of all parties, so far as known, and the reasons why relief is sought and that it is practicable. And upon the case being properly matured for hearing, and proofs being adduced of the propriety of the removal, the court shall have power to have the removal made and the remains properly deposited in another place, and to make sale of the grounds vacated by the removal and to have the costs of removal and reinterment, including the costs of the new place of interment, and of putting it in all respects in suitable condition and erecting upon it suitable memorials and the costs of the suit paid out of the proceeds of the sale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such removal and reinterment shall be done with due care and decency. But, unless the bill be filed by a city, town or county, the court shall not order such removal and reinterment until due and sufficient guaranty be given it that the proceeds of sale of the grounds proposed to be sold will be sufficient to meet all costs that may be incurred unless some party to the cause or other person gives due security to make good any deficit.
      </p>
      <p>

       When the owners of any private graveyard, not connected with any church or church property, abandon the graveyard and allow it to fall into a condition of neglect and disuse, so that it is unsightly and thereby lessens the desirability and value of adjacent land, and the owners fail or refuse, when requested by the owner of adjacent land or when requested by the local governing body of the county, city or town wherein the private graveyard is located, to remedy such condition of neglect and put the graveyard into suitable condition, then any owner of adjacent land or the local governing body may file a bill in equity in the circuit court of the county or city wherein the graveyard is located, for the purpose of requiring the graveyard to be placed in a suitable condition. The owners of the graveyard or any person having a right therein shall be made defendants to such court proceedings.

However, after hearing the evidence the court may allow the petitioners, at their own expense, to improve the graveyard and place it in suitable condition and may also require bond to ensure that the petitioners will not injure or remove any tomb, monument, gravestone, grave marker, or vault without having first obtained court approval.
    Acting pursuant to court order, the petitioners may thereafter enter upon the land and improve the graveyard and place it in suitable condition.
    The costs in any case involving a graveyard in which a grave or entombment right has never been sold shall be paid by the petitioners.

Applications for registration shall be in writing under oath or affirmation in the form prescribed by the Commissioner and contain such information as he may require. The application shall be accompanied by an annual fee of $100 for the professional fund-raising counsel. The fee for a professional solicitor shall be $500. Any professional solicitor who fails to register prior to any solicitation shall be required to pay a late filing fee of $250.

The bond shall run to the Commonwealth of Virginia for the use of the bonds in reimbursement for any penalties or losses resulting from malfeasance, nonfeasance or misfeasance in the conduct of solicitation activities.
