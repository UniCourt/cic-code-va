       An habitual offender adjudication rendered against a person under a disability
   
   for whom no guardian ad litem has been appointed is merely voidable; absent a showing that the offender was incapable of understanding the nature of the proceedings against him or of defending his interest, he may not collaterally attack the habitual offender adjudication. Graham v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 303, 443 S.E.2d 586, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1338, 1994 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 254</cite> (1994) (decided under prior law).

        Adjudication as an habitual offender held voidable. —

      <p>
       Where evidence showed that appellant was personally served with a show cause order on November 14, 1986, while in jail, he was adjudicated an habitual offender in his absence on December 16, 1986, and was served with a copy of the adjudication on February 3, 1987, and although appellant presented evidence to show that he was an alcoholic at the time of the adjudication, his expert witness testified that appellant would have been able to understand the legal process if he were sober and not suffering from alcohol withdrawal and appellant presented no evidence to show that, at the time he received the show cause order in jail, he was suffering from any sort of alcohol withdrawal which would have prevented him from understanding the nature of the proceedings against him, appellant’s adjudication in the absence of a guardian ad litem was voidable only and may not be set aside in a collateral proceeding. Graham v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 303, 443 S.E.2d 586, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1338, 1994 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 254</cite> (1994) (decided under prior law).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant contended that at the time of his habitual offender adjudication, he was an alcoholic and a person under disability, the court’s failure to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent him did not render the adjudication void and subject to collateral attack. Absent a showing of actual incapacity, a judgment against an alcoholic is voidable only, not subject to collateral attack. The record supported the trial court’s determination that, at the time of his habitual offender adjudication defendant’s condition did not require the appointment of a guardian ad litem. Eagleston v.

LEXIS 65 (1899) (holding that the Eastern State Hospital is such a corporation).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a hospital accepts a trust it stands on the same footing as any other trustee.
   
   The legislature may prohibit it from accepting the trust, but, when once accepted, the trust subject must be applied to the purpose to which it has been dedicated by the grantor. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, <cite class="va_code">115 Va. 527</cite>, 79 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 1064</cite>, 1913 Va. LEXIS 66 (1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       And private property donated by a testator to a well-defined valid trust cannot be diverted by the legislature
   
   to a distinctly different object. Hence, where land was devised to the Western State Hospital in trust for the benefit of its inmates, Acts 1906, p. 36, establishing an epileptic colony on such land, was invalid as being an unlawful diversion of trust funds. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, <cite class="va_code">115 Va. 527</cite>, 79 <cite class="va_code">S.E. 1064</cite>, 1913 Va. LEXIS 66 (1913).

       Whenever the Commissioner revokes, suspends, or denies a license, the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) shall apply.

       If a license is revoked or refused as herein provided, a new application for license may be considered by the Commissioner when the conditions upon which the action was based have been corrected and satisfactory evidence of this fact has been furnished. In no event may an applicant reapply for a license after the Commissioner has refused or revoked a license until a period of six months from the effective date of that action has elapsed, unless the Commissioner in his sole discretion believes that there has been such a change in the conditions causing refusal of the prior application or revocation of the license as to justify considering the new application. When an appeal is taken by the applicant pursuant to this section, the six-month period shall be extended until a final decision has been rendered on appeal. A new license may then be granted after proper inspection has been made and all provisions of this article and applicable regulations made thereunder have been complied with and recommendations to that effect have been made to the Commissioner upon the basis of an inspection by any authorized inspector or agent of the Department.

      <li id="t37.2c04a02s37.2-418ol1F">
       The summary order of suspension shall take effect upon its issuance and shall be served on the licensee or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the licensee. The order shall state the time, date, and location of a hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by the Commissioner or his designee.After such hearing, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the licensee may appeal the Commissioner’s decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following issuance of the order. The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Commissioner had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.The willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Commissioner may require the cooperation of any other agency or subdivision of the Commonwealth in the relocation of children who are residents of a home or facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to children.

Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by the Commissioner or his designee.After such hearing, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the licensee may appeal the Commissioner’s decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following issuance of the order. The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Commissioner had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.The willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Commissioner may require the cooperation of any other agency or subdivision of the Commonwealth in the relocation of adults who are residents of a home or facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to such residents.

     <p>
      The term of office of each member of a community services board shall be for three years from January 1 of the year of appointment or, at the option of the governing body of a county or city, from July 1 of the year of appointment, except that of the members first appointed, several shall be appointed for terms of one year each, several for terms of two years each, and the remaining members of the board for terms of three years each. The appointment of members for one-year, two-year, and three-year terms shall be as nearly equal as possible with regard to the total number of members on the board. If a governing body has appointed members for terms commencing January 1 or July 1 but desires to change the date on which the terms of office commence, the governing body may, as the terms of the members then in office expire, appoint successors for terms of two and one-half or three and one-half years, so that the terms expire on June 30 or December 31. In the case of a board established by more than one city or county, the decision to change the date on which terms of office commence shall be the unanimous decision of all governing bodies. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms in the same manner as original appointments. No person shall be eligible to serve more than three full terms; however, a person first appointed to fill an unexpired term may serve three additional full three-year terms. The remainder of a term to which a member is first appointed to fill a vacancy shall not constitute a term in determining the member’s eligibility for reappointment. However, after a one-year period has elapsed since the end of the member’s last three-year term, the governing body may reappoint that member. Any member of a board may be removed by the appointing authority for cause, after being given a written statement of the causes and an opportunity to be heard thereon.

         Be responsible for coordinating the community services necessary to accomplish effective preadmission screening and discharge planning for persons referred to the community services board. When preadmission screening reports are required by the court on an emergency basis pursuant to Article 5 (§ 37.2-814 et seq.) of Chapter 8, the community services board shall ensure the development of the report for the court. To accomplish this coordination, the community services board shall establish a structure and procedures involving staff from the community services board and, as appropriate, representatives from (i) the state hospital or training center serving the board’s service area, (ii) the local department of social services, (iii) the health department, (iv) the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services office in the board’s service area, (v) the local school division, and (vi) other public and private human services agencies, including licensed hospitals.

         Provide, in consultation with the appropriate state hospital or training center, discharge planning for any individual who, prior to admission, resided in a city or county served by the community services board or who chooses to reside after discharge in a city or county served by the board and who is to be released from a state hospital or training center pursuant to § 37.2-837. Upon initiation of discharge planning, the community services board that serves the city or county where the individual resided prior to admission shall inform the individual that he may choose to return to the county or city in which he resided prior to admission or to any other county or city in the Commonwealth. If the individual is unable to make informed decisions regarding his care, the community services board shall so inform his authorized representative, who may choose the county or city in which the individual shall reside upon discharge. In either case and to the extent permitted by federal law, for individuals who choose to return to the county or city in which they resided prior to admission, the community services board shall make every reasonable effort to place the individuals in such county or city. The community services board serving the county or city in which he will reside following discharge shall be responsible for arranging transportation for the individual upon request following the discharge protocols developed by the Department.The discharge plan shall be completed prior to the individual’s discharge. The plan shall be prepared with the involvement and participation of the individual receiving services or his representative and must reflect the individual’s preferences to the greatest extent possible. The plan shall include the mental health, developmental, substance abuse, social, educational, medical, employment, housing, legal, advocacy, transportation, and other services that the individual will need upon discharge into the community and identify the public or private agencies that have agreed to provide these services.No individual shall be discharged from a state hospital or training center without completion by the community services board of the discharge plan described in this subdivision. If state hospital or training center staff identify an individual as ready for discharge and the community services board that is responsible for the individual’s care disagrees, the community services board shall document in the treatment plan within 72 hours of the individual’s identification any reasons for not accepting the individual for discharge. If the state hospital or training center disagrees with the community services board and the board refuses to develop a discharge plan to accept the individual back into the community, the state hospital or training center or the community services board shall ask the Commissioner to review the state hospital’s or training center’s determination that the individual is ready for discharge in accordance with procedures established by the Department in collaboration with state hospitals, training centers, and community services boards. If the Commissioner determines that the individual is ready for discharge, a discharge plan shall be developed by the Department to ensure the availability of adequate services for the individual and the protection of the community. The Commissioner also shall verify that sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated to the community services board through the performance contract. If sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated, the Commissioner may contract with a private provider, another community services board, or a behavioral health authority to deliver the services specified in the discharge plan and withhold allocated funds applicable to that individual’s discharge plan from the community services board in accordance with subsections C and E of § 37.2-508.

     <p>
      A city or county, before it shall come within the provisions of this chapter, shall establish a behavioral health authority with a board of directors with no less than six and no more than 18 members. When any city or county establishes a behavioral health authority, the board of directors shall be appointed by the governing body of the city or county establishing the authority. Prior to making appointments, the governing body shall disclose the names of persons being considered for appointment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appointments to the board of directors shall be broadly representative of the community. One-third of the appointments to the board shall be individuals who are receiving or who have received services or family members of individuals who are receiving or who have received services, at least one of whom shall be an individual receiving services. One or more appointments may be nongovernmental services providers. Sheriffs or their designees also shall be appointed, when practical.

      The term of office of each member of the behavioral health authority board of directors shall be for three years from January 1 of the year of appointment or, at the option of the governing body of the city or county, from July 1 of the year of appointment, except that of the members first appointed, several shall be appointed for terms of one year each, several for terms of two years each, and the remaining members for terms of three years each. The appointment of members for one-year, two-year, and three-year terms shall be as nearly equal as possible with regard to the total number of members. If the governing body has appointed members for terms commencing January 1 or July 1 but desires to change the date on which the terms of office commence, the governing body may, as the terms of the members then in office expire, appoint successors for terms of two and one-half or three and one-half years, so that the terms expire on June 30 or December 31. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms in the same manner as original appointments. No person shall be eligible to serve more than three full consecutive three-year terms; however, persons appointed to fill vacancies may serve three additional full consecutive three-year terms. However, after a three-year period has elapsed since the end of the member’s last three-year term, the governing body may reappoint that member.

       The Department shall develop and initiate negotiation of the performance contracts through which it provides funds to behavioral health authorities to accomplish the purposes set forth in this chapter. The Department may, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, disburse state and federal funds appropriated to it for mental health, developmental, and substance abuse services directly to the behavioral health authority. Six months prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the Department shall make available to the public the standard performance contract form that it intends to use as the performance contract for that fiscal year and solicit public comments for a period of 60 days.

       Any behavioral health authority may apply for the assistance provided in this chapter by submitting annually to the Department its proposed performance contract for the next fiscal year together with the approval of its board of directors and the approval by formal vote of the governing body of the city or county that established it. The behavioral health authority shall make its proposed performance contract available for public review and solicit public comments for a period of 30 days prior to submitting its proposed contract for the approval of its board of directors. To avoid disruptions in service continuity and allow sufficient time to complete public review and comment about the contract and negotiation and approval of the contract, the Department may provide up to six semi-monthly payments of state-controlled funds to the authority. If the governing body of the city or county does not approve the proposed performance contract by September 30 of each year, the performance contract shall be deemed approved.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c06s37.2-608ol1C">
       The performance contract shall (i) delineate the responsibilities of the Department and the behavioral health authority; (ii) specify conditions that must be met for the receipt of state-controlled funds; (iii) identify the groups of individuals to be served with state-controlled funds; (iv) contain specific outcome measures for individuals receiving services, provider performance measures, satisfaction measures for individuals receiving services, and participation and involvement measures for individuals receiving services and their family members; (v) contain mechanisms that have been identified or developed jointly by the Department and the behavioral health authority and that will be employed collaboratively by the behavioral health authority and the state hospital to manage the utilization of state hospital beds; (vi) establish an enforcement mechanism, should the behavioral health authority fail to be in substantial compliance with its performance contract, including notice and appeal processes and provisions for remediation, withholding or reducing funds, methods of repayment of funds, and the Department’s exercise of the provisions of subsection E; and (vii) include reporting requirements and information about revenues, costs, services, and individuals receiving services displayed in a consistent, comparable format determined by the Department.The Department may provide for performance monitoring to determine whether behavioral health authorities are in substantial compliance with their performance contracts.

       If, after unsuccessful use of a remediation process described in the performance contract, a behavioral health authority remains in substantial noncompliance with its performance contract with the Department, the Department may, after affording the authority an adequate opportunity to use the appeal process described in the performance contract, terminate all or a portion of the contract. Using the state-controlled resources associated with that contract, the Department, after consulting with the governing body of the city or county that established the behavioral health authority, may negotiate a performance contract with a community services board, another behavioral health authority, or a private nonprofit or for-profit organization or organizations to obtain services that were the subject of the terminated performance contract.

     <p>
      Any director of a state facility employed or reemployed by the Commissioner after July 1, 2002, may be employed as a classified employee or under a contract that specifies the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation, benefits, duties and responsibilities, performance standards, evaluation criteria, and contract termination and renewal provisions. The length of employment contracts shall be two years, with provisions for annual renewals thereafter based on the performance of the incumbent. Any director of a state facility employed by the Commissioner before July 1, 1999, may elect to continue his current employment status subject to the provisions of the Virginia Personnel Act, Chapter 29 (§ 2.2-2900 et seq.) of Title 2.2, or he may choose to be employed under a contract. Any director of a state facility employed under an employment contract shall be exempt from the Virginia Personnel Act, yet he shall remain subject to the provisions of the State Grievance Procedure (§ 2.2-3000 et seq.). Personnel actions under this exemption shall be taken without regard to race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, color, national origin, religion, age, disability, or political affiliation.

     <p>
      Each director shall be responsible to the Commissioner or his designee for the safe, efficient, and effective operation of his state facility. Each director shall take any actions consistent with law necessary to ensure that his facility complies with all applicable federal and state statutes, regulations, policies, and agreements. The Commissioner shall evaluate the performance of each director of a state facility at least annually.

      Any person who has been or who may be admitted to any state facility or who is the subject of counseling or receives treatment from the staff of a state facility shall be deemed to be an individual receiving services for the purposes of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The income and estate of an individual receiving services shall be liable for the expenses of his care, treatment or training, and maintenance in a state facility. Any person responsible for holding, managing, or controlling the income and estate of the individual receiving services shall apply the income and estate toward the expenses of the individual’s care, treatment or training, and maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person responsible for the support of an individual receiving services pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.20.html#t20c05s20-61" target="_blank">20-61 </a></cite>shall be liable for the expenses of his care, treatment or training, and maintenance in a state facility. Any such person shall no longer be financially liable, however, when a cumulative total of 1,826 days of (i) care and treatment or training for the individual in a state facility, (ii) utilization by the individual of services or facilities under the jurisdiction or supervision of any community services board or behavioral health authority, or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) has passed and payment for or a written agreement to pay the charges for 1,826 days of care and services has been made. Not less than three hours of service per day shall be required to include one day in the cumulative total of 1,826 days of utilization of services under the jurisdiction or supervision of a community services board or behavioral health authority. In order to claim this exemption, the person legally liable for the individual shall produce evidence sufficient to prove eligibility for it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such expenses shall not exceed the average cost for the particular type of service rendered and shall be determined no less frequently than annually by the Department in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the health care industry. In no event shall recovery be permitted for amounts more than five years past due. A certificate of the Commissioner or his designee shall be prima facie evidence of the actual charges for the particular type of service rendered.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Commissioner may prescribe statement forms that shall be completed by those persons liable under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c07a02s37.2-715" target="_self">37.2-715 </a></cite>for the support of the individual receiving services. The statement shall be sworn to by the person and returned to the Commissioner within 30 days from the time the statement was mailed to the person. Should the person fail to return the properly completed statement to the Commissioner within 30 days, the Commissioner shall send another statement by registered mail. If the statement is not then returned properly completed within 30 days, the person to whom it was sent by registered mail shall be assessed $5 for each week or part of each week in excess of the 30-day period that the statement is overdue. The Department shall collect these assessments in the same manner as other sums due for the care, treatment or training, and maintenance of individuals receiving services from the persons whose duty it was to complete each statement. When collected, these assessments shall be paid into the same fund into which other collections are paid under this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      A statement of liability imposed by this section shall be placed in a prominent place, in boldface type, upon each statement form.

     <p>
      Upon the death of any individual who is receiving or who has received services, his estate shall be liable only for the charges remaining unpaid and not more than five years past due and the unsatisfied portion of any judgment rendered by a court in a proceeding under this article. Upon the death of any individual who is receiving or who has received services, the provisions of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c07a02s37.2-717" target="_self">37.2-717</a></cite>, which prohibit depleting the individual’s estate below $500, shall after funeral expenses have no further application, and such sum may be applied to the charges of the Department remaining unpaid or may be applied to the unsatisfied portion of any judgment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the death of any individual who is receiving or who has received services in the event amounts remain unpaid for his care, treatment or training, and maintenance, the Department, having reason to believe that the individual died possessed of real or personal property from which reimbursement may be had, shall prepare and acknowledge, as deeds are acknowledged, a notice showing the name of the individual and the actual per diem cost of maintenance due and shall file the notice within four months of the date of the individual’s death in the office of the clerk of the court in which deeds are admitted to record in the county or city in which the real or personal property is located. The clerk of court shall record this notice as a lien is recorded, indexing it in the names of the individual and the Department. The filing of this notice shall create a lien against the estate, both real and personal, of the deceased individual prior to all other claims of the same class except prior liens. No such claim shall be enforced against any real estate of the deceased individual while such real estate is occupied by the surviving spouse of the individual or while such real estate is occupied by any dependent child of the individual.

       Whenever a person alleged to have intellectual disability is not capable of requesting admission to a training center pursuant to § 37.2-805, a parent or guardian of the person or another responsible person may initiate a proceeding to certify the person’s eligibility for admission pursuant to this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c08a03s37.2-806ol1B">
       Prior to initiating the proceeding, the parent or guardian or other responsible person seeking the person’s admission shall first obtain (i) a preadmission screening report that recommends admission to a training center from the community services board or behavioral health authority that serves the city or county where the person who is alleged to have intellectual disability resides and (ii) the approval of the training center to which it is proposed that the person be admitted. The Board shall adopt regulations establishing the procedure and standards for the issuance of such approval. These regulations may include provision for the observation and evaluation of the person in a training center for a period not to exceed 48 hours. No person alleged to have intellectual disability who is the subject of a proceeding under this section shall be detained on that account pending the hearing except for observation and evaluation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

The petition shall be filed with any district court or special justice. A copy of the petition shall be personally served on the person named in the petition, his attorney, and his guardian or conservator. Prior to any hearing under this section, the judge or special justice shall appoint an attorney to represent the person. However, the person shall not be precluded from employing counsel of his choosing and at his expense.

       The person who is the subject of the hearing shall be allowed sufficient opportunity to prepare his defense, obtain independent evaluations and expert opinion at his own expense, and summons other witnesses. He shall be present at any hearing held under this section, unless his attorney waives his right to be present and the judge or special justice is satisfied by a clear showing and after personal observation that the person’s attendance would subject him to substantial risk of physical or emotional injury or would be so disruptive as to prevent the hearing from taking place.

       Notwithstanding the above, the judge or special justice shall summons either a physician or a clinical psychologist who is licensed in Virginia and is qualified in the assessment of persons with intellectual disability or a person designated by the local community services board or behavioral health authority who meets the qualifications established by the Board. The physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee may be the one who assessed the person pursuant to subsection B. The judge or special justice also shall summons other witnesses when so requested by the person or his attorney. The physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee shall certify that he has personally assessed the person and has probable cause to believe that the person (i) does or does not have intellectual disability, (ii) is or is not eligible for a less restrictive service, and (iii) is or is not in need of training or habilitation in a training center. The judge or special justice may accept written certification of a finding of a physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee, provided such assessment has been personally made within the preceding 30 days and there is no objection to the acceptance of the written certification by the person or his attorney.

       Where officers detained a detainee for further evaluation on the recommendation of a mental health evaluator who believed that the detainee might be psychotic, and the evaluator’s request for a temporary detention order was granted, the evaluator was entitled to qualified immunity as to the detainee’s Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure claim because the unlawfulness, if any, of the evaluator’s conduct was not clearly established at the time he recommended the detainee’s seizure.

       The General Assembly intends city and county police departments, and sheriffs’ offices in counties without police departments, that perform primary law-enforcement functions to execute emergency custody orders and provide transportation for emergency medical evaluation or treatment. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Dale Muterspaugh, Sheriff for Alleghany County, 04-45,
   (7/15/04) (but see 2009 amendments to this section as to transportation).

       Law-enforcement personnel are authorized to enter a residence and take a person into custody to execute an emergency custody order if the abode is the residence of the subject of the order and there is reason to believe that the subject is within the residence at the time of entry.
   If the abode is the residence of a third party, then law enforcement must obtain a search warrant before entering. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert P. Mosier, Fauquier County Sheriff, 21-058, 2021 Va. AG LEXIS (12/30/21).

       Sheriff is not authorized under subsection O of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-808" target="_self">37.2-808 </a></cite>to delay transportation of an individual following the issuance of a temporary detention order when the community services board and the designated state facility continue to search for an alternative facility. Rather, the sheriff should commence transportation to the designated state facility without delay, but if an alternative facility is identified during the period of transport, transportation should be provided to that facility instead.

If the town is not served by its own police department, the sheriff’s office of the surrounding county is tasked with executing such orders and with transporting persons subject to such orders.

       In jurisdictions served by police departments, the police department rather than the sheriff is the “primary law-enforcement agency” to execute both emergency custody under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-808" target="_self">37.2-808 </a></cite>and temporary detention orders under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-810" target="_self">37.2-810 </a></cite>and to provide transportation pursuant to such orders.

       Jurisdiction encompasses any locality or political subdivision, so that if a town has organized its own police department, that department, rather than the surrounding county’s sheriff’s office or police department is the primary law-enforcement agency. If the town does not have its own police department, then the responsibility for the orders and accompanying transportation falls to the county police department if there is one, and to the sheriff’s office if there is not.

        Commitment of insanity acquittees and of other persons compared. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Virginia’s scheme for the commitment of insanity acquittees is different in a number of respects from its scheme for the commitment of persons other than insanity acquittees. A person other than an insanity acquittee may be committed only if the fact finder determines that there is clear and convincing evidence that the person is insane and dangerous; he is given the right to a jury trial at the precommitment stage; he is automatically released after 180 days and if the State wishes to confine him for a longer period, it must initiate a fresh commitment proceeding every 180 days; and, finally, before the 180-day period has run, he has an unlimited right to seek release.

       Where an arrestee was detained for a mental health evaluation after the arrestee was arrested by police officers, the officers and a psychotherapist were not entitled to qualified immunity as to the Fourth Amendment claims, because the court was without enough information to determine what the officers and psychotherapist knew at the time of the arrest, the arrestee alleged that the officers acted on almost no information, and there was no allegation of any emergency situation. Raub v. Bowen, 960 F. Supp. 2d 602, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109122 (E.D. Va. 2013), dismissed, 3 F. Supp. 3d 526, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26258 (E.D. Va. 2014).

      <p>
       Where an arrestee was detained for a mental health evaluation after the arrestee was arrested by police officers, the arrestee’s First Amendment claim survived because the causation element could be inferred from the arrestee’s allegation that the only knowledge that the officers and a psychotherapist had at the time of arrest concerned the arrestee’s political views. Raub v. Bowen, 960 F. Supp. 2d 602, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109122 (E.D. Va. 2013), dismissed, 3 F. Supp. 3d 526, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26258 (E.D. Va. 2014).

       Where officers detained a detainee for further evaluation on the recommendation of a mental health evaluator who believed that the detainee might be psychotic, and the evaluator’s request for a temporary detention order was granted, the evaluator was entitled to qualified immunity as to the detainee’s Fourth Amendment unreasonable seizure claim because the unlawfulness, if any, of the evaluator’s conduct was not clearly established at the time he recommended the detainee’s seizure.

       If the 72-hour limit on detaining an individual pursuant to a temporary detention order, ends on a day when the general district court is open, but ends at a time when the court has already closed for that day, the individual may not be detained until the close of business on the next day the court is open.

       A law-enforcement officer may not detain an individual in a medical hospital after the 72-hour limit for a temporary detention order expires, when the individual is receiving ongoing treatment at that facility and has not yet been transferred to the designated mental health facility because he has not been “medically cleared.” See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Michael W.

      The General Assembly intends city and county police departments, and sheriffs’ offices in counties without police departments, that perform primary law-enforcement functions to execute emergency custody orders and provide transportation for emergency medical evaluation or treatment. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Dale Muterspaugh, Sheriff for Alleghany County, 04-45,

      Sheriff is not authorized under subsection O of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-808" target="_self">37.2-808 </a></cite>to delay transportation of an individual following the issuance of a temporary detention order when the community services board and the designated state facility continue to search for an alternative facility. Rather, the sheriff should commence transportation to the designated state facility without delay, but if an alternative facility is identified during the period of transport, transportation should be provided to that facility instead.

       Magistrate to specify primary law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction. —

      When a magistrate orders a law-enforcement agency to execute an order subjecting a person to emergency custody under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-808" target="_self">37.2-808</a></cite>, or temporary detention under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-810" target="_self">37.2-810</a></cite>, or providing for the transportation of such persons, the magistrate should specify the police department of the town as the “primary law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction” when a town is served by its own police department. If the town is not served by its own police department, the sheriff’s office of the surrounding county is tasked with executing such orders and with transporting persons subject to such orders. See opinion of Attorney General to Karen T. Mullins, Esquire, County Attorney, Wise County, 11-123,
   (10/21/11).
     </p>
     <p>
      In jurisdictions served by police departments, the police department rather than the sheriff is the “primary law-enforcement agency” to execute both emergency custody under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-808" target="_self">37.2-808 </a></cite>and temporary detention orders under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c08a04s37.2-810" target="_self">37.2-810 </a></cite>and to provide transportation pursuant to such orders.

      A sheriff discharges his duty when he transports an individual to a hospital pursuant to an order of temporary detention, and he is not required to remain for the screening process, unless the temporary detention order includes a specific requirement to transport the person to such other medical facility as may be necessary to obtain emergency medical evaluation or treatment prior to placement of the individual; in such situations, the custody of the individual remains with the sheriff until the individual is delivered to the temporary detention facility.

     </p>
     <p>
      Jurisdiction encompasses any locality or political subdivision, so that if a town has organized its own police department, that department, rather than the surrounding county’s sheriff’s office or police department is the primary law-enforcement agency. If the town does not have its own police department, then the responsibility for the orders and accompanying transportation falls to the county police department if there is one, and to the sheriff’s office if there is not.

       At the commencement of the commitment hearing, the district court judge or special justice shall inform the person whose involuntary admission is being sought of his right to apply for voluntary admission for inpatient treatment as provided for in § 37.2-805 and shall afford the person an opportunity for voluntary admission. The district court judge or special justice shall advise the person whose involuntary admission is being sought that if the person chooses to be voluntarily admitted pursuant to § 37.2-805, such person will be prohibited from possessing, purchasing, or transporting a firearm pursuant to § 18.2-308.1:3. The judge or special justice shall ascertain if the person is then willing and capable of seeking voluntary admission for inpatient treatment. In determining whether a person is capable of consenting to voluntary admission, the judge or special justice may consider evidence regarding the person’s past compliance or noncompliance with treatment. If the judge or special justice finds that the person is capable and willingly accepts voluntary admission for inpatient treatment, the judge or special justice shall require him to accept voluntary admission for a minimum period of treatment not to exceed 72 hours. After such minimum period of treatment, the person shall give the facility 48 hours’ notice prior to leaving the facility. During this notice period, the person shall not be discharged except as provided in § 37.2-837, 37.2-838, or 37.2-840.

      <p>
       Even if Virginia law permitted the commitment hearing to be conducted without the presence of the person whose commitment is sought, the federal Constitution would require the presence of the person whose involuntary commitment is sought prior to an order of hospitalization being entered. The most elementary notions of due process require that an individual be permitted to be heard, and to hear the evidence adduced against him, before actions are taken by the State which substantially deprive him of his liberty.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since transfer of a state prison inmate from a prison to a mental institution is conditioned on proof of the prisoner’s need for treatment, state law provides a “liberty” interest sufficient to require a due process hearing under such circumstances.

       Placement in a mental institution constitutes a serious deprivation of liberty, and that deprivation is substantial even for a person already confined in a penal institution. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977).

    Commitment hearing for involuntary admission; preadmission screening report.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The district court judge or special justice shall require a preadmission screening report from the community services board that serves the county or city where the person resides or, if impractical, where the person is located. The report shall be admitted as evidence of the facts stated therein and shall state (i) whether the person has a mental illness and whether there exists a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the person will, in the near future, (a) cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatening harm and other relevant information, if any, or (b) suffer serious harm due to his lack of capacity to protect himself from harm or to provide for his basic human needs, (ii) whether the person is in need of involuntary inpatient treatment, (iii) whether there is no less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment, and (iv) the recommendations for that person’s placement, care, and treatment including, where appropriate, recommendations for mandatory outpatient treatment. The board shall provide the preadmission screening report to the court prior to the hearing, and the report shall be admitted into evidence and made part of the record of the case. In the case of a person who has been sentenced and committed to the Department of Corrections and who has been examined by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, the judge or special justice may proceed to adjudicate whether the person has mental illness and should be involuntarily admitted without requesting a preadmission screening report from the community services board.

     <p>
      The Commissioner is authorized to enter into a contract with the United States, through the Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons or other authorized agent of the United States, for the reception, maintenance, care, and observation in state facilities, or in those designated by the Commissioner for the purpose, of any persons charged with a crime in the courts of the United States sitting in Virginia and committed by the courts to the state facilities for those purposes. All persons so admitted shall remain subject to the jurisdiction of the court by whom they were committed, and they may be returned to that court at any time for hearing or trial.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such contract shall require that the United States remit to the State Treasurer for each prisoner admitted specified per diem or other payments, or both, with such payments fixed by the contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director of any state facility to which a prisoner of the United States is admitted shall observe the person and, as soon as possible, report in writing to the court by which he is certified or committed as to his mental condition or other matters as the court may direct.
     </p>
     <p>
      No contract made pursuant to this section shall obligate the Commonwealth or the Commissioner to receive a federal prisoner into any state facility in which all available beds are needed for persons otherwise admitted, or in any other case where, in the opinion of the director, the admission of the prisoner would interfere with the care and treatment of other persons admitted or with the proper administration of the state facility.

If the judge or special justice determines that transportation may be provided by an alternative transportation provider, the judge or special justice may consult with the proposed alternative transportation provider either in person or via two-way electronic video and audio or telephone communication system to determine whether the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner. If the judge or special justice finds that the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner, the judge or special justice may order transportation by the proposed alternative transportation provider. In all other cases, the judge or special justice shall order transportation by the sheriff of the jurisdiction where the person is a resident unless the sheriff’s office of that jurisdiction is located more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place. In cases where the sheriff of the jurisdiction of which the person is a resident is more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place, it shall be the responsibility of the sheriff of the latter jurisdiction to transport the person.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the judge or special justice determines that the person requires transportation by the sheriff, the person may be delivered to the care of the sheriff, as specified in this section, who shall transport the person to the proper facility. In no event shall transport commence later than six hours after notification to the sheriff or alternative transportation provider of the judge’s or special justice’s order.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any state hospital has become too crowded to admit any such person, the Commissioner shall give notice of the fact to all community services boards and shall designate the facility to which sheriffs or alternative transportation providers shall transport such persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an alternative transportation provider providing transportation of a person becomes unable to continue providing transportation of the person at any time after taking custody of the person, the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which the alternative transportation provider is located at the time he becomes unable to continue providing transportation shall take custody of the person and shall transport the person to the proper facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person who provides alternative transportation pursuant to this section shall be liable to the person being transported for any civil damages for ordinary negligence in acts or omissions that result from providing such alternative transportation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever it appears that a person with mental illness is a veteran eligible for treatment in a Veterans’ Affairs hospital, center, or other facility or installation, the district court judge or special justice may, upon receipt of a certificate of eligibility from that hospital, center, or other facility or installation, order the person to that hospital, center, or other facility or installation, regardless of whether the person resides in Virginia. Any veteran who has been or is in a state hospital and is eligible for treatment in a Veterans Affairs hospital, center, or other facility or installation may be transferred to a Veterans Affairs hospital, center, or other facility or installation with the written consent of its manager. Any veteran admitted to a Veterans Affairs hospital, center, or other facility or installation, if he resided in Virginia prior to his admission and meets the criteria for admission to a state hospital, may be transferred to a state hospital with the written authorization of the Commissioner.

Furthermore, the SVPA was a non-punitive, civil commitment statute and as such did not violate the guarantees against double jeopardy or ex post facto lawmaking. Shivaee v.

Rather, in cases where the Commonwealth seeks to prohibit a prisoner from presenting such evidence, the court will have the discretion to allow or bar such evidence based upon its inquiry into the circumstances under which the prisoner made a decision at the time of the examination and whether the prisoner remains steadfast in the refusal to cooperate.

       Petitioner was entitled to have effective assistance of counsel to represent his during his proceedings in which he attempted to avoid involuntary civil commitment as a sexually violent predator since he had a substantial liberty interest in avoiding such confinement; accordingly, his habeas corpus petition was granted to allow for his belated appeal of the finding that he was a sexually violent predator in a case where his appeal of that finding was dismissed because his counsel did not file petitioner’s trial transcripts on time.

       Trial court erred in finding that the prisoner could be civilly committed pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act, as the prisoner had already completed his sentence for a rape conviction and was only being held pursuant to convictions that were not for sexually violent offenses; since the clear and unambiguous language of the Act, especially §§ 37.1-70.4 and 37.1-70.5 [see now §§ <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-903" target="_self">37.2-903 </a></cite>and <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-904" target="_self">37.2-904</a></cite>], required that he be currently held for a sexually violent offense in order to be civilly committed.

      <p>
       Judgment classifying defendant as sexually violent predator and civilly committing him under Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act was affirmed because he failed to show gross negligence or willful misconduct regarding inclusion in database of prisoners incarcerated for sexually violent offense. Although defendant was not serving an active sentence for his attempted sodomy conviction when he was included in the database of prisoners incarcerated for sexually violent offenses, he unquestionably was serving an active sentence of eight years at the time for his abduction conviction.

      <p>
       In a case in which the Commonwealth appealed a trial court’s dismissal of its petition for the civil commitment of respondent as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, the Commonwealth unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law because in stating that respondent had a mental abnormality or personality disorder, the trial court had necessarily found that he was likely to engage in sexually violent offenses. Considering the trial court’s statements as a whole, it was clear that in stating that respondent had a mental abnormality or personality disorder, the trial court was not using those terms as dispositive of whether that disorder made him likely to engage in sexually violent acts; the trial court treated those two findings as distinct considerations, and that was consistent with the analysis the Supreme Court of Virginia had applied in other cases.

       Circuit court erred when it excluded juvenile records in a sexually violent predator proceeding under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA), § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900 </a></cite>et seq., because the 1996 amendment to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.16.1.html#t16.1c11a12s16.1-306" target="_blank">16.1-306</a></cite>, providing retention of juvenile records for certain offenses, came into effect before the inmate’s 29th birthday, the date on which the right to record destruction would otherwise have vested. Thus, the inmate did not have a due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to have his juvenile records destroyed and considered inadmissible in the SVPA proceedings. Commonwealth v. Garrett, <cite class="va_code">276 Va. 590</cite>, 667 S.E.2d 739, 2008 Va. LEXIS 116 (2008).

       Defendant’s commitment to the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services [now the Department of Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Services] after it was found that he met the definition of a sexually violent predator under the Sexually Violent Predators Act, was appropriate because a psychologist’s opinions were not speculative and unreliable as a matter of law. The psychologist did not base his opinion on the inference that defendant committed the offense dismissed by nolle prosequi; his opinions that defendant suffered from pedophilia and from a personality disorder, as well as his opinion that defendant was a sexually violent predator, were supported by defendant’s prior convictions for sexual offenses against children and by trial evidence. Boyce v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">279 Va. 644</cite>, 691 S.E.2d 782, 2010 Va. LEXIS 46 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court’s finding that defendant was a sexually violent predator in need of treatment in a secure facility was supported by clear and convincing evidence. While neither psychologist was able to opine that the sexual offenses the offender was likely to commit in the future would be sexually violent acts as defined in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900</a></cite>, they were clear that the random, brutal nature of the rape defendant committed and other elements of his history were significant factors in their determination that the likelihood that he would reoffend was higher than the actuarial data suggested. DeMille v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">283 Va. 316</cite>, 720 S.E.2d 69, 2012 Va. LEXIS 13 (2012).

      <p>
       In a case in which the Commonwealth appealed a trial court’s dismissal of its petition for the civil commitment of respondent as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, the Commonwealth unsuccessfully challenged the trial court’s finding, arguing that the exhibits and uncontradicted testimony of two experts left the trial court with the only reasonable conclusion that defendant was a sexually violent predator. The opinion of experts was not dispositive, and, as shown by the record, respondent had no incidents of a sexual nature for almost 10 years, since 1999, whether he was in the community or incarcerated; that evidence suggested that his actions were, as a matter of fact, not consistent with the statistical predictors of re-offending and stood in contrast to the experts’ opinions on the likelihood of him committing future violent sexual acts.

       Sexually violent predator’s (SVP) liberty interest is a diminished one when compared to the liberty interests under review in capital cases and other criminal proceedings; a defendant in a criminal case was presumed innocent, but respondents had already been found, by clear and convincing evidence, to be “sexually violent predators,” and their onerous terms of release limited an SVP’s liberty and thus, diminish the liberty interest at issue.

       Where the Virginia Attorney General failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that an inmate was likely to commit sexually violent acts in the future because of his mental abnormality or personality disorder, but merely offered evidence to support the proposition that, because of the inmate’s antisocial personality disorder, he was impulsive in his actions and decision making, such evidence was insufficient to satisfy the explicit requirements of this section; thus, the Attorney General’s petition to have the inmate civilly committed was denied.

LEXIS 20 (Roanoke Mar. 28, 2005).

       Trial court erred in finding that the prisoner could be civilly committed pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act, as the prisoner had already completed his sentence for a rape conviction and was only being held pursuant to convictions that were not for sexually violent offenses; since the clear and unambiguous language of §§ 37.1-70.4 and 37.1-70.5 [see now §§ <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-903" target="_self">37.2-903 </a></cite>and <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-904" target="_self">37.2-904</a></cite>], required that he be currently held for a sexually violent offense for him to be civilly committed and he was not being held for such an offense, he could not be civilly committed under the Act. Townes v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">269 Va. 234</cite>, 609 S.E.2d 1, 2005 Va. LEXIS 30 (2005) (decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evaluation is triggered under the Virginia Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act by incarceration for a sexually violent offense and impending release from incarceration, not by conviction of a new sexually violent offense.

      <p>
       Res judicata did not prohibit an inmate, determined in a prior proceeding not to be a sexually violent predator from being subjected to reevaluation and redetermination of his status as a sexually violent predator at the conclusion of a subsequent period of reincarceration for the same sex offenses since the 2011 petition arose as a result of the inmate’s impending release from custody after a new term of incarceration for a sexually violent offense and concerned the inmate’s mental health status in 2011; the 2011 petition was not dependent upon the same evidence as the 2005 proceeding, nor did the 2011 petition arise from the same conduct, transaction or occurrence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in ruling that an inmate was a sexually violent predator under former § 37.1-70.4 [now this section]; under the statute as it read when sexually violent predator proceedings were started against the inmate, a score of four or more on the Rapid Risk Assessment for Sexual Offender Recidivism was a condition precedent to such a ruling and the evidence showed that the inmate’s score was less than four.

       CRC assessments of eligible prisoners or defendants shall include a mental health examination, including a personal interview, of the prisoner or defendant by a licensed psychiatrist or a licensed clinical psychologist who is designated by the Commissioner, skilled in the diagnosis and risk assessment of sex offenders, knowledgeable about the treatment of sex offenders, and not a member of the CRC. If the prisoner’s or defendant’s name was forwarded to the CRC based upon an evaluation by a licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist, a different licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist shall perform the examination for the CRC. The licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist shall determine whether the prisoner or defendant is a sexually violent predator, as defined in § 37.2-900, and forward the results of this evaluation and any supporting documents to the CRC for its review.The CRC assessment may be based on:An actuarial evaluation, clinical evaluation, or any other information or evaluation determined by the CRC to be relevant, including but not limited to a review of (i) the prisoner’s or defendant’s institutional history and treatment record, if any; (ii) his criminal background; and (iii) any other factor that is relevant to the determination of whether he is a sexually violent predator.

To assist the Attorney General in his review, the Department of Corrections, the CRC, and the psychiatrist or psychologist who conducts the mental health examination pursuant to this section shall provide the Attorney General with all evaluation reports, prisoner records, criminal records, medical files, and any other documentation relevant to determining whether a prisoner or defendant is a sexually violent predator.

       Where the Virginia Attorney General failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that an inmate was likely to commit sexually violent acts in the future because of his mental abnormality or personality disorder, but merely offered evidence to support the proposition that, because of the inmate’s antisocial personality disorder, he was impulsive in his actions and decision making, such evidence was insufficient to satisfy the explicit requirements of § 37.1-70.1 [see now § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900</a></cite>]; thus the Attorney General’s petition to have the inmate civilly committed was denied.

       Petitioner did not show that his involuntary civil commitment was invalid even though he claimed that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hold a probable cause hearing to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to hold a hearing on whether he was a sexually violent predator and to find that he was in fact a sexually violent predator; statutory law clearly authorized the trial court to hold such hearings, even where defendant was not currently in custody.

       Language of subsection A of this section is unambiguous and the court is therefore bound by the plain meaning that 90 days means 90 days; this is the intent of the legislature when this statute is read with § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-905.1" target="_self">37.2-905.1 </a></cite>because the General Assembly did not include subsection A of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-906" target="_self">37.2-906 </a></cite>in this substantial compliance statute, which is further evidence, in addition to the plain language of subsection A of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-906" target="_self">37.2-906</a></cite>, of legislative intent that the probable cause hearing occur within 90 days.

      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature in using the language “extending the case beyond the 90 days,” and in providing only two grounds on which the court can extend the case beyond that time, manifests an intent that 90 days requirement is mandatory and not directory; holding the Commonwealth to the clearly stated timeframe of subsection A does not constitute an unreasonably restrictive interpretation, particularly given that the Commonwealth need show only good cause to schedule a hearing beyond the timeframe. Commonwealth v. Rickman, 94 Va. Cir. 1, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Chesterfield County Jan. 27, 2016), aff'd on other grounds, <cite class="va_code">294 Va. 531</cite>, 808 S.E.2d 395, 2017 Va. LEXIS 199 (2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority granted to the Commonwealth pursuant to the the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act is strictly statutory, it finds no basis in the common law, and it uniquely combines both civil and criminal elements; as such, that authority must be strictly construed if the Sexually Violent Predators Act is to be applied without prejudice or excess. Commonwealth v. Rickman, 94 Va. Cir. 1, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Chesterfield County Jan. 27, 2016), aff'd on other grounds, <cite class="va_code">294 Va. 531</cite>, 808 S.E.2d 395, 2017 Va.

      </p>

       General consideration of an individual’s liberty and due process interests, and the parameters under which the government can exercise its unique authority, leads to the conclusion that the language of subsection A is mandatory, not directory.

       Expert’s opinion was admissible in a report at a proceeding to civilly commit defendant as a sexually violent predator because the expert had an adequate factual foundation to make the determination that defendant suffered from the mental abnormality of pedophilia. Further, the expert’s determination with respect to the risk that defendant would find it difficult to control defendant’s predatory behavior, which made defendant likely to engage in sexually violent acts, was proper.

       Res judicata did not prohibit an inmate, determined in a prior proceeding not to be a sexually violent predator from being subjected to reevaluation and redetermination of his status as a sexually violent predator at the conclusion of a subsequent period of reincarceration for the same sex offenses since the 2011 petition arose as a result of the inmate’s impending release from custody after a new term of incarceration for a sexually violent offense and concerned the inmate’s mental health status in 2011; the 2011 petition was not dependent upon the same evidence as the 2005 proceeding, nor did the 2011 petition arise from the same conduct, transaction or occurrence.

       Evidence was sufficient to support the civil commitment of an inmate as a sexually violent predator because the inmate was incarcerated upon a conviction for a sexually violent offense, the inmate was clearly diagnosed with the mental abnormality of pedophilia by experts, and there was clear and convincing evidence that because of his mental abnormality the inmate found it difficult to control his predatory behavior, which made it likely that he would engage in sexually violent acts.

       Circuit court’s finding that defendant was a sexually violent predator in need of treatment in a secure facility was supported by clear and convincing evidence. While neither psychologist was able to opine that the sexual offenses the offender was likely to commit in the future would be sexually violent acts as defined in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900</a></cite>, they were clear that the random, brutal nature of the rape defendant committed and other elements of his history were significant factors in their determination that the likelihood that he would reoffend was higher than the actuarial data suggested.

       In a case in which the Commonwealth appealed a trial court’s dismissal of its petition for the civil commitment of respondent as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, the Commonwealth unsuccessfully challenged the trial court’s finding, arguing that the exhibits and uncontradicted testimony of two experts left the trial court with the only reasonable conclusion that defendant was a sexually violent predator. The opinion of experts was not dispositive, and, as shown by the record, respondent had no incidents of a sexual nature for almost 10 years, since 1999, whether he was in the community or incarcerated; that evidence suggested that his actions were, as a matter of fact, not consistent with the statistical predictors of re-offending and stood in contrast to the experts’ opinions on the likelihood of him committing future violent sexual acts.

       Where the Virginia Attorney General failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that an inmate was likely to commit sexually violent acts in the future because of his mental abnormality or personality disorder, but merely offered evidence to support the proposition that, because of the inmate’s antisocial personality disorder, he was impulsive in his actions and decision making, such evidence was insufficient to satisfy the explicit requirements of § 37.1-70.1 [see now § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900</a></cite>]; thus, the Attorney General’s petition to have the inmate civilly committed was denied.

       Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator with an expert; continuances to locate and produce an expert will cause delay where resolution of a matter is intended to be both expeditious and temporary, and the allocation of the burden of proof reduced the need for a separate expert for a respondent, and the risk of error is significantly mitigated by subsequent reviews.

       Continued treatment and confinement of defendant in a secure facility was appropriate because he continued to be a sexually violent predator as he made little or no progress since his last annual review and suffered from several conditions, including deviant sexual interest to adolescents.

        Due process does not require appointment of defense expert. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the temporary, expedited nature of the hearing and the other protections afforded to respondents, including the right to counsel, the Due Process Clause did not require the State to appoint an expert to assist them in a hearing to determine whether they violated the conditions of their release and whether those violations rendered them unsuitable for conditional release; at their annual review, if they requested discharge, respondents were entitled to be evaluated by a second expert. Harvey v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 403</cite>, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       State’s interest weighed against the appointment of an expert for a sexually violent predator; the expert was not the prosecution’s expert or the defense’s expert and can conclude, over the objections of the Attorney General, that the respondent is, in fact, amenable to conditional release, and this non-adversarial model for selecting experts reduces the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a liberty interest. Harvey v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 403</cite>, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator with an expert; continuances to locate and produce an expert will cause delay where resolution of a matter is intended to be both expeditious and temporary, and the allocation of the burden of proof reduced the need for a separate expert for a respondent, and the risk of error is significantly mitigated by subsequent reviews. Harvey v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 403</cite>, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator (SVP) with an expert; the SVP possesses a recognized but diminished liberty interest, the expert who issues the report is not selected by the entity responsible for prosecuting SVP cases but rather by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, and the SVP is afforded other due process protections, such as the right to counsel. Harvey v. Commonwealth, <cite class="va_code">297 Va. 403</cite>, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019).

        Sexually violent predator has diminished liberty interest. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexually violent predator’s (SVP) liberty interest is a diminished one when compared to the liberty interests under review in capital cases and other criminal proceedings; a defendant in a criminal case was presumed innocent, but respondents had already been found, by clear and convincing evidence, to be “sexually violent predators,” and their onerous terms of release limited an SVP’s liberty and thus, diminish the liberty interest at issue.

        Conditional release of sexually violent predator to out-of-state agency. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in conditionally releasing a sexually violent predator to an out-of-state agency because no provision of the Virginia Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act), § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c09s37.2-900" target="_self">37.2-900 </a></cite>et seq., authorized the conditional release of an sexually violent predator outside the Commonwealth of Virginia.

      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1A">
       An appropriate circuit court or district court judge or special justice may authorize treatment for a mental or physical disorder on behalf of an adult person, in accordance with this section, if it finds upon clear and convincing evidence that (i) the person is either incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf or is incapable of communicating such a decision due to a physical or mental disorder and (ii) the proposed treatment is in the best interest of the person.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1B">
       Any person may request authorization of treatment for an adult person by filing a petition in the circuit court or district court or with a special justice of the county or city in which the person for whom treatment is sought resides or is located or in the county or city in which the proposed place of treatment is located. Upon filing the petition, the petitioner or the court shall deliver or send a certified copy of the petition to the person for whom treatment is sought and, if the identity and whereabouts of the person’s next of kin are known, to the next of kin.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1C">
       As soon as reasonably possible after the filing of the petition, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the person for whom treatment is sought at the hearing. However, the appointment shall not be required in the event that the person or another interested person on behalf of the person elects to retain private counsel at his own expense to represent the interests of the person at the hearing. If the person for whom treatment is sought is indigent, his counsel shall be paid by the Commonwealth as provided in § 37.2-804 from funds appropriated to reimburse expenses incurred in the involuntary admission process. However, this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the direct payment of an attorney’s fee by the person or an interested person on his behalf, which fee shall be subject to the review and approval of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1D">
       Following the appointment of an attorney pursuant to subsection C, the court shall schedule an expedited hearing of the matter. The court shall notify the person for whom treatment is sought, his next of kin, if known, the petitioner, and their respective counsel of the date and time for the hearing. In scheduling the hearing, the court shall take into account the type and severity of the alleged physical or mental disorder, as well as the need to provide the person’s attorney with sufficient time to adequately prepare his client’s case.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1E">
       Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections B and D regarding delivery or service of the petition and notice of the hearing to the next of kin of any person for whom consent to treatment is sought, if the person is a patient in any hospital, including a hospital licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to § 32.1-123 or an individual receiving services in any facility operated by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and such person has no known guardian or legally authorized representative, at the time the petition is filed, the court may dispense with the requirement of any notice to the next of kin. If treatment is necessary to prevent imminent or irreversible harm, the court in its discretion may dispense with the requirement of providing notice. This subsection shall not be construed to interfere with any decision made pursuant to the Health Care Decisions Act (§ 54.1-2981 et seq.).
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1F">
       Prior to the hearing, the attorney shall investigate the risks and benefits of the treatment decision for which authorization is sought and of alternatives to the proposed decision. The attorney shall make a reasonable effort to inform the person of this information and to ascertain the person’s religious beliefs and basic values and the views and preferences of the person’s next of kin. A health care provider shall disclose or make available to the attorney, upon request, any information, records, and reports concerning the person that the attorney determines necessary to perform his duties under this section. Evidence presented at the hearing may be submitted by affidavit in the absence of objection by the person for whom treatment is sought, the petitioner, either of their respective counsel, or by any other interested party.
      </li>
      <li id="t37.2c11s37.2-1101ol1G">
       Prior to authorizing treatment pursuant to this section, the court shall find:

         That there is no available person with legal authority under Article 8 (§ 54.1-2981 et seq.) of Chapter 29 of Title 54.1, under the regulations promulgated pursuant to § 37.2-400, or under other applicable law to authorize the proposed treatment. A person who would have legal authority to authorize the proposed treatment shall be deemed to be unavailable if such person (i) cannot be contacted within a reasonable period of time in light of the immediacy of the need for treatment for the person for whom treatment is sought, (ii) is incapable of making an informed decision, or (iii) is unable or unwilling to make a decision regarding authorization of the proposed treatment or to serve as the legally authorized representative of the person for whom treatment is sought;

       The duration of temporary detention pursuant to this section shall not exceed 24 hours, unless extended by the court as part of an order authorizing treatment under § 37.2-1101.

If, before issuance of an order under this subsection or during its period of effectiveness, the physician learns of an objection by a member of the person’s immediate family to the testing, observation, or treatment, he shall so notify the court or magistrate, who shall consider the objection in determining whether to issue, modify, or terminate the order.

In any case in which an order for temporary detention for testing, observation, or treatment is issued for a person who is also the subject of an emergency custody order pursuant to § 37.2-808, the hospital emergency room or other appropriate facility in which the person is detained for testing, observation, or treatment shall notify the nearest community services board when such testing, observation, or treatment is complete, and the designee of the community services board shall, as soon as is practicable and prior to the expiration of the order for temporary detention issued pursuant to subsection B, conduct an evaluation of the person to determine if he meets the criteria for temporary detention pursuant to § 37.2-809.

       Trial court’s order pursuant to former § 37.1-134.21 requiring a mental patient to undergo medical treatment was affirmed, because the patient failed to provide a sufficient record as required by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 in order to allow the appellate court to consider the patient’s arguments that the evidence was insufficient for the trial court to find that he was incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf, and that the trial court failed to make certain findings required by subsection H of former § 37.1-134.21 [now see subsection G of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t37.2c11s37.2-1101" target="_self">37.2-1101</a></cite>].
