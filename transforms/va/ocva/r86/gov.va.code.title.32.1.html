                    <p>
                        At its regular session of 1974, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to study Title 32, Health, of the Code and to report its findings in the form of a recodification of that title. In December of 1978, the Commission sent to the Governor
                        and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 32 and also drafts of several companion bills which would accomplish additional changes sought by the State Department of Health. This report contains revisor’s
                        notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The proposed revision of Title 32 was adopted by the 1979 General Assembly as chapter 711 of the Acts of 1979. Effective October 1, 1979,
                        it repealed Title 32 and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 32.1. It also repealed certain provisions of <cite class="va_code">Titles 54</cite> and 62.1 and incorporated substantially similar provisions
                        in the new Title 32.1. The companion acts to Acts 1979, c. 711, repealed designated provisions of Title 32 and enacted substantially similar provisions in titles other than new Title 32.1. In addition to its revision by Chapter
                        711, former Title 32 was also amended by other acts passed at the 1979 session. As required by § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.30.html#t30c15s30-152" target="_blank">30-152</a></cite>, the Code Commission has incorporated
                        these amendments into new Title 32.1, or into corresponding sections of other titles enacted by companion acts to Chapter 711. In addition, an amendment to § 54-524.109:18, which section was repealed by Chapter 711, has been incorporated
                        in the corresponding new section, § 32.1-88.
                    </p>

                        Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 32.

                        the order to limit the spread of COVID-19 and expressly waived the application of the criminal prohibition on the wearing of a mask to conceal one’s identity. The winery could not demonstrate a likely success as to the merits,
                        irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest. Strother v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 233, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 106 (Fauquier County June 29, 2020).

                        Circuit court found that demurrer was appropriate as to a constitutional challenge to statutes promulgated in response to pandemic because the court found that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege that statutes were unconstitutional delegations
                        of Virginia legislative authority. The court also found that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege a substantive due process, procedural due process, or equal protection violation. Dillon v. Northam, 108 Va. Cir. 367, 2021

                        medical treatment via telemedicine services as defined in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.38.2.html#t38.2c34a02s38.2-3418.16" target="_blank">38.2-3418.16 </a></cite>of the Code of Virginia.
                        The Department shall set out the criteria that would be required for a locality or group of localities in the Commonwealth to be eligible for the designation as a medical excellence zone. Such criteria shall include that any locality
                        or group of localities eligible for the Program must demonstrate economic disadvantage of residents in the proposed medical excellence zone. The Department of Health shall report its findings to the Senate Committee on Education

                        of the application forms used by such pharmaceutical assistance programs and pharmaceutical discount purchasing cards in Virginia, compile a list of the various information required to complete such application forms, identify
                        common elements, and analyze the forms for readability and simplicity. Upon completion of this analysis, the Commissioners shall assess the feasibility of designing a single, concise application form that is logically formatted,
                        written in clear and easily comprehensible language, and covers any and all data that may be required to obtain eligibility for any such pharmaceutical assistance program or pharmaceutical discount purchasing card.

                        license or Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement less than ninety days in advance; or (iv) operate at any time under conditions which present a major and continuing threat to the health, safety, security, rights or welfare of
                        the patients, including the threat of imminent abandonment by the owner or operator, or a pattern of failure to meet ongoing financial obligations such as the inability to pay for essential food, pharmaceuticals, personnel, or

                        finds that such conditions will not be remedied and that the patients will not be protected unless the petition is granted.No receivership established under this subsection shall continue in effect for more than 180 days without
                        further order of the court, nor shall the receivership continue in effect following the revocation of the nursing home’s license or the termination of the certified nursing facility’s Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement, except
                        to enforce any post-termination duties of the provider as required by the provisions of the Medicare or Medicaid provider agreement.The appointed receiver shall be a person licensed as nursing home administrator in the Commonwealth
                        pursuant to Title 54.1 or, if not so licensed, shall employ and supervise a person so licensed to administer the day-to-day business of the nursing home or certified nursing facility.The receiver shall have (i) such powers and
                        duties to manage the nursing home or certified nursing facility as the court may grant and direct, including but not limited to the duty to accomplish the orderly relocation of all patients and the right to refuse to admit new
                        patients during the receivership, (ii) the power to receive, conserve, protect and disburse funds, including Medicare and Medicaid payments on behalf of the owner or operator of the nursing home or certified nursing facility, (iii)
                        the power to execute and avoid executory contracts, (iv) the power to hire and discharge employees, and (v) the power to do all other acts, including the filing of such reports as the court may direct, subject to accounting to
                        the court therefor and otherwise consistent with state and federal law, necessary to protect the patients from the threat or threats set forth in the original petitions, as well as such other threats arising thereafter or out of
                        the same conditions.The court may grant injunctive relief as it deems appropriate to the Department or to its receiver either in conjunction with or subsequent to the granting of a petition for appointment of a receiver under this
                        section.The court may terminate the receivership on the motion of the Department, the receiver, or the owner or operator, upon finding, after a hearing, that either (i) the conditions described in the petition have been substantially
                        eliminated or remedied, or (ii) all patients in the nursing home or certified nursing facility have been relocated. Within thirty days after such termination, the receiver shall file a complete report of his activities with the
                        court, including an accounting for all property of which he has taken possession and all funds collected.All costs of administration of a receivership hereunder shall be paid by the receiver out of reimbursement to the nursing
                        home or certified nursing facility from Medicare, Medicaid and other patient care collections. The court, after terminating such receivership, shall enter appropriate orders to ensure such payments upon its approval of the receiver’s
                        reports.A receiver appointed under this section shall be an officer of the court, shall not be liable for conditions at the nursing home or certified nursing facility which existed or originated prior to his appointment and shall
                        not be personally liable, except for his own gross negligence and intentional acts which result in injuries to persons or damage to property at the nursing home or certified nursing facility during his receivership.The provisions
                        of this subsection shall not be construed to relieve any owner, operator or other party of any duty imposed by law or of any civil or criminal liability incurred by reason of any act or omission of such owner, operator, or other

                        As used in this section: “Cooperative local health budget” means the total amount of state funds, local matching funds, and estimated self-generated local service revenues allocated to support a local department of health. “Estimated self-generated local
                        service revenues” means the amount of funds projected to be received by a local department of health from fees charged to individuals or third-party payment sources for services and permits. “Local matching funds” means the amount
                        of funds that a county or city shall be required to contribute to the cooperative local health budget for the local health department that serves that county or city. “Revenue generation capacity factor” means the result of a formula
                        that (i) determines a county’s or city’s revenue capacity relative to the state revenue capacity, (ii) determines a county’s or city’s median household income relative to the statewide median household income, and (iii) adjusts
                        the amount determined in clause (i) by the amount determined in clause (ii).

                        With regard to defendant’s conviction for assault and battery of a law-enforcement officer and his contention on appeal that the trial court erred by ordering him to submit to a blood test since the officer alleged that defendant transferred blood onto
                        him via a handshake, the court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply, therefore, the trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to suppress the blood evidence. Application of the exclusionary rule was not the
                        proper remedy since the defendant made no allegation of police misconduct relevant to the appeal. Harman v. Commonwealth, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 74</cite> (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2009).

                <p>
                    The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing a protocol for the identification of children at risk for elevated blood-lead levels which shall (i) require blood-lead level testing at appropriate ages and frequencies, when indicated, (ii) provide
                    for criteria for determining low risk for elevated blood-lead levels and when such blood-lead level testing is not indicated, and (iii) require physicians to make available to parents information on the dangers of lead poisoning, along
                    with a list of available resources, as part of regular well check visits for all children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As deemed necessary by the Board, the protocol may also address follow-up testing for children with elevated blood-lead levels, dissemination of the protocol or other information to relevant health care professionals, appropriate information for parents,
                    and other means of preventing lead poisoning among children. In promulgating such regulations, the Board shall consider the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and may consider such other materials relating
                    to lead poisoning prevention, testing, and treatment as it deems appropriate. The Board may also establish procedures governing how health care providers and laboratories report results to the Department of Health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Commissioner may authorize linkages between secure electronic data systems maintained by the Department of Health containing blood-lead level records and the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS) operated pursuant to §

                    As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Appropriate precautions” means those specific measures which have been demonstrated by current scientific evidence to assist in preventing transmission of a communicable disease of public health significance. Appropriate precautions will vary according
                    to the disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “At-risk behavior” means engaging in acts which a person, who has been informed that he is infected with a communicable disease of public health significance, knows may infect other persons without taking appropriate precautions to protect the health
                    of the other persons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Communicable disease of public health significance” means an illness of public health significance, as determined by the State Health Commissioner, caused by a specific or suspected infectious agent that may be transmitted directly or indirectly from
                    one individual to another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Communicable disease of public health significance” shall include, but may not be limited to, infections caused by human immunodeficiency viruses, blood-borne pathogens, and tubercle bacillus. The State Health Commissioner may determine that diseases
                    caused by other pathogens constitute communicable diseases of public health significance. Further, “a communicable disease of public health significance” shall become a “communicable disease of public health threat” upon the finding
                    of the State Health Commissioner of exceptional circumstances pursuant to Article 3.02 (§ <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c02a3.02s32.1-48.05" target="_self">32.1-48.05 </a></cite>et seq.) of this chapter.

                        need process on graduate medical education programs and teaching hospitals in the Commonwealth; (vii) the efficacy of regional health planning agencies, the role of regional health planning agencies in the certificate of public

                        plan should be updated more frequently. The work group shall develop specific recommendations for changes to the certificate of public need process to address any problems or challenges identified during such review, which shall
                        include recommendations for changes to the process to be introduced during the 2016 Session of the General Assembly and any additional changes that may require further study or review. In conducting its review and developing its

                        jurisdiction to hear the appeal; therefore, the competitors’ demurrers were sustained. Loudoun Hosp. Ctr. v. Stroube, 68 Va. Cir. 271, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 229 (Loudoun County July 19, 2005).

                        A freestanding emergency facility that is owned and operated by a licensed hospital is not required to be separately licensed unless it falls within one of the classifications of “hospital” set forth in regulations promulgated by the state Board of Health.
                        Additionally, the establishment of a freestanding emergency facility is not subject to the issuance of a certificate of public need unless it qualifies as a “medical care facility” under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c04a1.1s32.1-102.1" target="_self">32.1-102.1. </a></cite>See

                    A freestanding emergency facility that is owned and operated by a licensed hospital is not required to be separately licensed unless it falls within one of the classifications of “hospital” set forth in regulations promulgated by the state Board of Health.
                    Additionally, the establishment of a freestanding emergency facility is not subject to the issuance of a certificate of public need unless it qualifies as a “medical care facility” under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c04a1.1s32.1-102.1" target="_self">32.1-102.1. </a></cite>See

                        “Consistent with,” as used in the context of subsection A of this section, does not mean “exactly alike” or “the same in every detail.” It means, instead, “in harmony with,” “compatible with,” “holding to the same principles,” or “in general agreement

                        Health Plan. Second, in determining whether such public need for a project has been demonstrated, the Commissioner must consider the 20 criteria set forth in subsection B. Roanoke Mem. Hosps. v. Kenley, 3 Va. App. 599, 352 S.E.2d

                        Under Virginia’s Health Care Planning law, before certain projects may be commenced, a medical care facility shall first obtain a certificate of need (CON) issued by the commissioner. The commissioner must determine that a public need for the project
                        has been demonstrated and any decision to issue a CON must be consistent with the most recent applicable provisions of the State Health Plan (SHP) and the State Medical Facilities Plan (SMFP). If the commissioner finds that the
                        provisions of either plan are inaccurate, outdated, inadequate, or otherwise inapplicable, the commissioner may nevertheless issue a CON and institute procedures to amend the plan appropriately. Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley,

                        services were provided in a different market than other imaging services, and thus less susceptible to the dangers of excess capacity or geographical misallocation, and the providers had provided no general context or perspective

                        On appeal from the issuance of a certificate of public need to a healthcare provider, a hospital was an aggrieved party under § 2.2-4026 because its status as a provider of the same, competing services at a facility six miles from the healthcare provider’s
                        facility placed a burden on it different from that suffered by the public generally. Furthermore, the hospital had an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest in the case decision by virtue of the fact that §

                        Commissioner considered “all 21 matters” in former subsection B of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c04a1.1s32.1-102.3" target="_self">32.1-102.3</a></cite>, which included the most recent State Medical
                        Facilities Plan; (2) the Commissioner reviewed a recommended decision that considered the most recent State Medical Facilities Plan; and (3) former subsection B of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c04a1.1s32.1-102.3" target="_self">32.1-102.3 </a></cite>did
                        not require the Commissioner to make specific findings on each factor considered, so the Commissioner’s failure to specifically reference the State Medical Facilities Plan was not fatal. Petersburg Hosp. Co., LLC v. Remley, 2012

                        Evidence of harm in the administrative record was not necessary to establish a medical center’s standing to appeal the issuance of a certificate of public need to a competitor because the administrative proceedings focused on evidence of public need,
                        rather than of harm. Pleading harm that consisted of a decrease in utilization and efficiency of its services and an increased financial burden was sufficient to establish the medical center’s aggrieved party status. West Creek

                        Hospital’s requested certificate of public need was inconsistent with the State Medical Facility Plan because (1) existing services met regional need, (2) the hospital sought to provide less than minimum services, (3) the hospital’s proposal was inconsistent

                        U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.), Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.), and 10 U.S.C. § 1071 et seq. In addition, the Commissioner shall condition the approval of a certificate upon the agreement of the applicant

                        underserved areas of the applicant’s service area, or (iii) all of the above. Except in the case of nursing homes, the value of charity care provided to individuals pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the provider reimbursement
                        methodology utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for reimbursement under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.Every certificate holder shall develop a financial assistance policy
                        that includes specific eligibility criteria and procedures for applying for charity care, which shall be provided to a patient at the time of admission or discharge or at the time services are provided, included with any billing
                        statements sent to uninsured patients, posted conspicuously in public areas of the medical care facility for which the certificate was issued and posted on a website maintained by the certificate holder.The certificate holder shall
                        annually provide documentation to the Department demonstrating that the certificate holder has satisfied the conditions of the certificate, including documentation of the amount of charity care provided to patients. If the certificate
                        holder is unable or fails to satisfy the conditions of a certificate, the Department may approve alternative methods to satisfy the conditions pursuant to a plan of compliance, which shall identify a timeframe within which the
                        certificate holder will satisfy the conditions of the certificate, and identify how the certificate holder will satisfy the conditions of the certificate, which may include (a) making direct payments to an organization authorized
                        under a memorandum of understanding with the Department to receive contributions satisfying conditions of a certificate, (b) making direct payments to a private nonprofit foundation that funds basic insurance coverage for indigents
                        authorized under a memorandum of understanding with the Department to receive contributions satisfying conditions of a certificate, or (c) other documented efforts or initiatives to provide primary or specialized care to underserved
                        populations. In cases in which the certificate holder holds more than one certificate with conditions pursuant to this subsection, and the certificate holder is unable to satisfy the conditions of one certificate, such plan of
                        compliance may provide for satisfaction of the conditions on that certificate by providing care at a reduced rate to indigent individuals in excess of the amount required by another certificate issued to the same holder, in an
                        amount approved by the Department provided such care is offered at the same facility. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall prohibit the satisfaction of conditions of more than one certificate among various affiliated facilities
                        or certificates subject to a system-wide or all-inclusive charity care condition established by the Commissioner. In determining whether the certificate holder has met the conditions of the certificate pursuant to a plan of compliance,
                        only such actions undertaken after issuance of the conditioned certificate shall be counted towards satisfaction of conditions.Any person refusing, failing, or neglecting to honor such agreement shall be subject to a civil penalty
                        of up to $100 per violation per day until the date of compliance which shall be collected by the Commissioner and paid into the Literary Fund. For the purpose of determining the amount of a civil penalty imposed pursuant to this

                        Such application shall be filed in accordance with procedures established by the Department. An application submitted for review shall be considered complete when all relevant sections of the application form have responses. The
                        applicant shall provide sufficient information to prove public need for the requested project exists without the addition of supplemental or supporting material at a later date. The Department shall ensure that only data necessary
                        for review of an application is required to be submitted and that the application reflects statutory requirements. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Department from seeking, at its discretion, additional information from
                        the applicant or other sources.Within 10 calendar days of the date on which the document is received, the Department and the appropriate regional health planning agency, if a regional health planning agency has been designated,
                        shall determine whether the application is complete or not and the Department shall notify the applicant, if the application is not complete, of the information needed to complete the application. If no regional health planning
                        agency is designated for the health planning region in which the project will be located, no filing with a regional health planning agency is required and the Department shall determine if the application is complete and notify
                        the applicant, if the application is not complete, of the information needed to complete the application.At least 30 calendar days before any person is contractually obligated to acquire an existing medical care facility, the cost
                        of which is $600,000 or more, that person shall notify the Commissioner and the appropriate regional health planning agency, if a regional health planning agency has been designated, of the intent, the services to be offered in
                        the facility, the bed capacity in the facility and the projected impact that the cost of the acquisition will have upon the charges for services to be provided. If clinical services or beds are proposed to be added as a result
                        of the acquisition, the Commissioner may require the proposed new owner to obtain a certificate prior to the acquisition. If no regional health planning agency is designated for the health planning region in which the acquisition
                        will take place, no notification to a regional health planning agency shall be required.

                        At least nine days prior to the public hearing, the regional health planning agency shall cause notice of the public hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the project is proposed

                        to respond to any comments made about the project by the regional health planning agency staff, any information in a regional health planning agency staff report, or comments by those voting members of the regional health planning
                        agency board; however, such opportunity shall not increase the 60-calendar-day period designated herein for the regional health planning agency’s review unless the applicant or applicants request a specific extension of the regional
                        health planning agency’s review period.The regional health planning agency shall submit its recommendations on each application and its reasons therefor to the Department within 10 calendar days after the completion of its 60-calendar-day

                        the applicant’s request for extension and submitted its recommendations on the application and the reasons therefor within 10 calendar days after the completion of its review, the Department shall, on the eleventh calendar day
                        after the expiration of the regional health planning agency’s review period, proceed as though the regional health planning agency has recommended project approval without conditions or revision.If no regional health planning agency
                        has been designated for a region, the Department shall (a) within 10 calendar days following the start of the review cycle, solicit public comment on such application by posting notice of such application and a summary of the proposed
                        project on a website maintained by the Department; such notice shall include such information about how comments may be submitted to the Department and the date on which the public comment period shall expire, which shall be no
                        later than 45 calendar days following the date of the public notice, and (b) in the case of competing applications or in response to a written request by an elected local government representative, a member of the General Assembly,
                        the Commissioner, the applicant, or a member of the public, hold one hearing on each application in a location in the county or city in which the project is proposed or a contiguous county or city. Prior to any required hearing,

                        of the center’s sixteen beds, if and whenever that could occur, was not in the nature of an immediate interest that would support aggrieved party status. Inova Loudoun Hosp. v. Remley, 77 Va. Cir. 411, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 96 (Loudoun

                        State Health Commissioner properly granted good cause standing to a hospital authority pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c04a1.1s32.1-102.6" target="_self">32.1-102.6 </a></cite>because it demonstrated good cause
                        standing to review of a second hospital authority’s certificate of public need application to establish open heart surgery services in the health planning district at issue where, inter alia, the second hospital authority had relied
                        upon and cited utilization data that was over inclusive and counted more procedures than just open and closed heart surgeries a substantial or material mistake of law, the Commissioner’s findings were entitled to due deference,
                        and her factual determinations were supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. Chesapeake Hosp. Auth. v. State Health Comm'r, 105 Va. Cir. 555, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1207 (Chesapeake Mar. 27, 2019).

                    Whenever an emergency medical services agency or emergency medical services vehicle owned or operated by an emergency medical services agency is in violation of any provision of this article or any applicable regulation, the Commissioner shall have power
                    to revoke or suspend such emergency medical services agency’s license and the permits of all emergency medical services vehicles owned or operated by the emergency medical services agency. The Commissioner may temporarily suspend any
                    license for an emergency medical services agency or permit for an emergency medical services vehicle without notice, pending a hearing or informal fact-finding conference, if the Commissioner finds that there is a substantial danger
                    to public health or safety. When the Commissioner has temporarily suspended a license or permit pending a hearing, the Commissioner shall seek an expedited hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).

                    The governing bodies of the several counties or cities of the Commonwealth may create and establish, by designation on a map of the county or city showing current, official parcel boundaries, or by any other description that is legally sufficient for
                    the conveyance of property or the creation of parcels, emergency medical services zones or districts in such counties or cities within which may be located and established one or more emergency medical services agencies for providing
                    emergency medical services within such zones or districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event of the creation of such zones or districts in any county or city, the county or city governing body may acquire, in the name of the county or city, real or personal property to be devoted to the uses aforesaid and shall prescribe rules and
                    regulations for the proper management, control, and conduct thereof. Such governing body shall also have authority to contract with, or secure the services of, any individual corporation, organization, or municipal corporation or any
                    volunteer emergency medical services agency or emergency medical services provider for such emergency medical services as may be required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To raise funds for the purposes aforesaid, the governing body of any county or city in which such zones or districts are established may levy annually a tax on the assessed value of all property, real and personal, within such zones or districts, subject
                    to local taxation, which tax shall be extended and collected as other county or city taxes are extended and collected. However, any property located in Augusta County that has qualified for an agricultural or forestal use-value assessment
                    pursuant to Article 4 (§ 58.1-3229 et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1 may not be included within such a zone or district and may not be subject to such tax. In any county or city having a population between 25,000 and 25,500, the
                    maximum rate of tax under this section shall be $0.30 on $100 of assessed value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount realized from such levy shall be kept separate from all other moneys of the county or city and shall be applied to no other purpose than the maintenance and operation of the emergency medical services agencies established pursuant to this section.

                <p>
                    In the interest of maintaining a regional health planning mechanism in the Commonwealth, there is hereby established funding for regional health planning. From such moneys as may be available and appropriated, this fund shall provide support of a maximum
                    of fifteen cents per capita for each regional health planning agency as may be designated. Per capita population figures shall be obtained from official population estimates. This funding may be used for the administration of the regional
                    health planning agency, the analysis of issues, and such other health planning purposes as may be requested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any local governing body may choose to appropriate funds for the purpose of providing additional funds for a regional health planning agency. However, nothing in this section shall place any obligation on any local governing body to appropriate funds
                    to any regional health planning agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each regional health planning agency shall be required to apply to the Department for funding, which shall be distributed as grants. This funding shall be administered by the Department, and the Board shall promulgate regulations as are necessary and
                    relevant to administer the funding. All applications for such funding shall be accompanied by letters of assurance that the applicant shall comply with all state requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For purposes of this section, regional health planning agencies in existence as of July 1, 2002, shall be retained as designated regional health planning agencies unless (i) the Board, pursuant to its regulations, revises such designations, or (ii) any
                    individual regional health planning agency ceases operation or the designation as a regional health planning agency is otherwise terminated in accordance with the agreement between the regional health planning agency and the Board.

                            Communities lack the ability to coordinate, across jurisdictions, health partnership efforts between local governments and private providers of health care services, which leads to duplicative and inefficient services. Such public/private partnerships
                            could (i) encourage the use of service delivery that otherwise might have required government funding or programs; (ii) allow governments to fully participate in such partnerships; (iii) maximize the willingness of individuals,
                            agencies and private organizations to lend their expertise to help satisfy community needs; (iv) allow innovative funding mechanisms to leverage public funds; (v) allow appropriate information sharing to ensure the adequacy
                            and quality of services delivered; (vi) provide liability protection for volunteers providing services under programs sponsored or approved by the authority; (vii) provide a mechanism to ensure that services provided in the
                            community are necessary, appropriate, and provided by trained and supervised persons; and (viii) allow volunteers and others to focus their energies to achieve community health improvement. Health care services include, but
                            are not limited to, treatment of and education about acute and chronic diseases, wellness and prevention activities that promote the health of communities, and access to services and activities.

                        Foundation was not a hospital for purposes of § 8.01-38 charitable immunity, as the foundation was not a “facility” pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c05a01s32.1-123" target="_self">32.1-123</a></cite>; rather, it
                        was the entity that employed the physicians who cared for patients at a university hospital. The fact that the foundation owned and operated several clinics in outlying areas did not change this analysis. MacArthur v. Univ. of

                        from tort liability under the doctrine of charitable immunity and did not fall under the scope of § 8.01-38’s denial of charitable immunity to hospitals. The facility’s charter established the rebuttable presumption that it was

                    <p>
                        Defendant argued that the evidence underlying his conviction was obtained through the execution of constitutionally invalid search warrants, however, the showing of probable cause in the agent’s affidavit was predicated on defendant’s billing practices,
                        not on whether he was legally permitted to perform surgery in his podiatry office; accordingly, even if the affidavit had included a Virginia statutory provision, § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c05a01s32.1-124" target="_self">32.1-124</a></cite>,
                        under which defendant might lawfully have performed the surgeries for which he billed, it would nonetheless have supplied probable cause to believe that his billing itself was fraudulent. The district court thus did not err in
                        denying defendant’s motion to suppress and his request for a Franks hearing. United States v. Blatstein, 482 F.3d 725, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 8392 (4th Cir. 2007).

                    As used in this section unless the context requires a different meaning, “hospital” means a hospital as defined in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c05a01s32.1-123" target="_self">32.1-123 </a></cite>or <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.37.2.html#t37.2c01s37.2-100" target="_blank">37.2-100.

                    State agencies shall make or cause to be made only such inspections of hospitals as are necessary to carry out the various obligations imposed on each agency by applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Any on-site inspection by a state agency
                    or a division or unit thereof that substantially complies with the inspection requirements of any other state agency or any other division or unit of the inspecting agency charged with making similar inspections shall be accepted as
                    an equivalent inspection in lieu of an on-site inspection by said agency or by a division or unit of the inspecting agency. A state agency shall coordinate its hospital inspections both internally and with those required by other state
                    agencies so as to ensure that the requirements of this section are met. No hospital shall receive additional inspections until all other licensed hospitals in the Commonwealth have also been inspected, unless the additional inspections
                    are (i) necessary to follow up on a preoperational inspection or one or more violations, (ii) required by a uniformly applied risk-based schedule established by the Department, (iii) necessary to investigate a complaint regarding the
                    hospital, or (iv) otherwise deemed necessary by the Commissioner or his designee to protect the health and safety of the public.

                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, all hospitals licensed by the Department of Health or Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services that have been certified under the provisions of Title XVIII of the Social Security
                    Act for hospital or psychiatric services or that have obtained accreditation from a national accrediting organization granted authority by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure compliance with Medicare conditions

                        an entity. Good faith acquisition of medical information by an employee or agent of an entity for the purposes of the entity is not a breach of the security of the system, provided that the medical information is not used for a

                    As used in this article unless a different meaning or construction is clearly required by the context or otherwise:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hospice” means a coordinated program of home and inpatient care provided directly or through an agreement under the direction of an identifiable hospice administration providing palliative and supportive medical and other health services to terminally
                    ill patients and their families. A hospice utilizes a medically directed interdisciplinary team. A hospice program of care provides care to meet the physical, psychological, social, spiritual and other special needs which are experienced
                    during the final stages of illness, and during dying and bereavement. Hospice care shall be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hospice facility” means an institution, place, or building owned or operated by a hospice provider and licensed by the Department to provide room, board, and appropriate hospice care on a 24-hour basis, including respite and symptom management, to individuals
                    requiring such care pursuant to the orders of a physician. Such facilities with 16 or fewer beds are exempt from Certificate of Public Need laws and regulations. Such facilities with more than 16 beds shall be licensed as a nursing
                    facility or hospital and shall be subject to Certificate of Public Need laws and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hospice patient” means a diagnosed terminally ill patient, with an anticipated life expectancy of six months or less, who, alone or in conjunction with designated family members, has voluntarily requested admission and been accepted into a licensed hospice
                    program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hospice patient’s family” shall mean the hospice patient’s immediate kin, including a spouse, brother, sister, child or parent. Other relations and individuals with significant personal ties to the hospice patient may be designated as members of the
                    hospice patient’s family by mutual agreement among the hospice patient, the relation or individual, and the hospice team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Identifiable hospice administration” means an administrative group, individual or legal entity that has a distinct organizational structure, accountable to the governing authority directly or through a chief executive officer. This administration shall
                    be responsible for the management of all aspects of the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Inpatient” means the provision of services, such as food, laundry, housekeeping, and staff to provide health or health-related services, including respite and symptom management, to hospice patients, whether in a hospital, nursing facility, or hospice
                    facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Interdisciplinary team” means the patient and the patient’s family, the attending physician, and the following hospice personnel: physician, nurse, social worker, and trained volunteer. Providers of special services, such as clergy, mental health, pharmacy,
                    and any other appropriate allied health services may also be included on the team as the needs of the patient dictate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Palliative care” means treatment directed at controlling pain, relieving other symptoms, and focusing on the special needs of the patient and family as they experience the stress of the dying process, rather than the treatment aimed at investigation
                    and intervention for the purpose of cure or prolongation of life.

                    The Commissioner may cause each hospice licensed under this article to be periodically inspected at reasonable times. However, no hospice shall receive additional inspections until all other hospices in the Commonwealth have also been inspected, unless
                    the additional inspections are (i) necessary to follow up on a preoperational inspection or one or more violations, (ii) required by a uniformly applied risk-based schedule established by the Department, (iii) necessary to investigate
                    a complaint regarding the hospice, or (iv) otherwise deemed necessary by the Commissioner or his designee to protect the health and safety of the public.

                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this article, any hospice organization that has obtained accreditation as provided in subdivision 2 of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c05a07s32.1-162.2" target="_self">32.1-162.2</a></cite>,
                    may be subject to inspection so long as such accreditation is maintained but only to the extent necessary to ensure the public health and safety. If any such hospice fails to comply with the provisions of this article or with the regulations
                    of the Board relating to public health and safety, the Commissioner may revoke the exemption from licensure and require such hospice to be relicensed before it can again qualify for an exemption pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c05a07s32.1-162.2" target="_self">32.1-162.2.

                </p>
                <p>
                    “Human research” means any systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, utilizing human subjects, that is designed to develop or contribute to generalized knowledge. Human research shall not be deemed to include research
                    exempt from federal research regulation pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 46.101(b).

                        A Virginia locality may not require an owner to obtain a special exception to a local zoning ordinance in order to install an alternative onsite sewage system where the conditions set forth in subsection C of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.15.2.html#t15.2c21a07s15.2-2157" target="_blank">15.2-2157 </a></cite>are
                        met, including that (1) there is no sewer or sewerage disposal facility available; and (2) the alternative onsite sewage system has been approved by the Virginia Department of Health for use in the particular circumstances and
                        conditions in which the proposed system is to be operating. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Member, Senate of Virginia, 10-061, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 79 (12/03/10).

                        onsite systems that exceed those established by the Virginia Department of Health, thus, if the special exception places requirements on alternative onsite sewage system that are more restrictive than those prescribed by the department,
                        the ordinance would exceed the scope of the authority granted to localities. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Member, Senate of Virginia, 10-061, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 79 (12/03/10).

                        Circuit court declined to sustain a demurrer by a health department because the writ of mandamus that the permit applicant sought depended upon the health department having acted in its discretion when it determined that it had no jurisdiction. The court

                        Definition of “owner” does not specify the source of the water being supplied, but rather, it expressly contemplates a private owner as the definition encompasses both private and public ownership; thus, private wells are not exempt from the possible
                        water sources for a waterworks, and instead, the definition of “owner” simply refers to supplying water to any person in Virginia via a waterworks. North View Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021

                        While an assisted living facility took steps to separate the water from each well, because the facility consisted of a single building, and because of the nature of the care provided by the facility, the evidence established that water from each well

                        Virginia Department of Health’s determination that the “25 or more individuals” requirement was satisfied by a cumulative daily number of individuals equaling or exceeding twenty-five was not contrary to the statute; the statute lacks any requirement

                        Despite an assisted living facility’s lack of an application for a permit for a waterworks, the Virginia Department of Health was within its authority under Virginia Administrative Process Act to begin the administrative process and eventually issue a
                        case decision determining that such a permit was necessary because the facility, as the owner of a waterworks, was not able to operate without a permit. North View Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021

                        Assisted living facility’s water system was a waterwork because its wells served piped water, its water system served at least 15 service connections or 25 or more individuals, and the facility operated year-round; the testimony of the facility’s owner
                        that the staff helped residents with bathing and teeth brushing and that they prepared and cleaned up after meals established that the water piped into the facility from the wells was used for human consumption. North View Home

                        Definition of “owner” does not specify the source of the water being supplied, but rather, it expressly contemplates a private owner as the definition encompasses both private and public ownership; thus, private wells are not exempt from the possible
                        water sources for a waterworks, and instead, the definition of “owner” simply refers to supplying water to any person in Virginia via a waterworks. North View Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021

                        Determination of the parties’ rights as to whether a site could be developed in satisfaction of a county’s original zoning proffer was proper because the developer hired engineers and other professionals, submitted applications, and underwent an appeals

                    of its manufacture or use may pose a substantial threat to human health or to the environment shall have the affirmative duty to report that information to the Board within five days of receiving it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In discharging this duty to report, each person shall have the further affirmative duty to make reasonable inquiry into the toxicity of any substance. Any knowledge of toxicity that is possessed by an employee or agent of the person, or by the holder
                    of any patent under which the person is licensed to produce such substance, shall be attributed to that person if the person actually received that knowledge or, in the exercise of due diligence of such person, should have received
                    that knowledge. Any knowledge of toxicity that is possessed by any consultant or independent contractor, who has been retained by the person to perform any evaluation or other task which involves any such substance, shall be attributed
                    to the person if such person actually received that knowledge or, in the exercise of due diligence by such person, should have received that knowledge.

                    Except as provided in this section, the Board shall not require any reports by operators of commercial establishments to be filed pursuant to this article unless the Board can demonstrate that the report is necessary to prevent or lessen an imminent risk
                    of injury to public health or the environment.

                    Each person who operates a commercial establishment in which any chemical is manufactured or is used as a raw material, catalyst, final product or process solvent shall direct each of his employees to a physician for diagnosis of any injury or illness
                    of any kind whatever that the person knows, or reasonably should know, may be caused by such chemical. Nothing in this article shall be deemed, however, to authorize or require physical examination or medical treatment for any person

                        Trial court erred in denying summary judgment to adoptive same-sex parents and their children, and granting it to the Registrar of Vital Records and Health Statistics and the State Health Commissioner in the parents’ action, seeking issuance of new birth
                        certificates with the names of both adoptive parents on them, as a proper interpretation of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c07a02s32.1-261" target="_self">32.1-261</a></cite>, 12 VAC § 5-550-330, and
                        other relevant statutes and regulations indicated that the terms “adoptive parents” and “intended parents” were undefined, but that reference was not made specifically to a mother and a father; there was nothing that prohibited
                        the names of both adoptive parents from being listed and accordingly, relief should have been granted, as requested, to the adoptive parents. Davenport v. Little-Bowser, <cite class="va_code">269 Va. 546</cite>, 611 S.E.2d 366,

                        Denial of a wife’s petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, contrary to the trial court’s finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have been revived by corrective measures, and the wife’s action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate
                        was not an option because, under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.20.html#t20c02s20-13" target="_blank">20-13</a></cite>, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized; a marriage license presupposed
                        a “marriage ceremony” solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. Section <cite class="ocva"><a href="gov.va.code.title.20.html#t20c02s20-31" target="_blank">20-31 </a></cite>had
                        no application in cases where the putative marriage was void ab initio. Davidson v. Davidson, 2009 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 313</cite> (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009).

                        Statutes make plain the General Assembly’s intent that a license must precede the solemnization ceremony. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 255</cite> (2015), vacated,

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly ruled that a husband and wife never married because their marriage ceremony was not under a license since the husband and wife did not have a license when they held their marriage ceremony, and when they did obtain a license they
                        did not perform any kind of solemnization; mailing a license via express mail for a signature when the parties were not even present did not constitute “solemnization.” MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015
                        <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 255</cite> (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 90</cite> (2016).

                        Nothing in the governing statutes or case law renders a marriage void ab initio or voidable merely because the officiant and celebrants agree in advance to solemnize the marriage. Levick v. MacDougall, <cite class="va_code">294 Va. 283</cite>,
                        805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Dissimilar use of the terms “solemnization” and “ceremony” implies that the General Assembly has declined to adopt a specific definition for solemnization, leaving the details to the discretion of the officiant and the celebrants. Levick v. MacDougall,
                        <cite class="va_code">294 Va. 283</cite>, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017).

                        Although a rabbi could have violated subsection C by not filing the marriage certificate within five days of the marriage ceremony that he officiated, neither the statute nor any other statute mandated that the officiant’s violation voided the celebrants’
                        marriage; they have no control of whether he files the certificate five, six, or sixty days later, and the legal validity of their marriage cannot be so easily extinguished. Levick v. MacDougall, <cite class="va_code">294 Va. 283</cite>,

                        Trial court abused its discretion in denying an inmate’s application for a name change and in holding that good cause did not exist because the inmate had been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder and was transitioning from the male gender to the female
                        gender, the General Assembly had already recognized that a shift in a person’s gender was a valid reason to change his or her name and to amend that person’s vital records, and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the
                        inmate’s name change was sought with frivolous intentions or that the name change would have any negative impact on the community. In re Brown, <cite class="va_code">289 Va. 343</cite>, 770 S.E.2d 494, 2015

                        Husband could be the administrator of a decedent’s estate because a certified copy of the marriage between the husband and decedent was admitted into evidence, and it created a presumption of a lawful marriage; the presumption of marriage had not been
                        rebutted, and thus, the husband was the surviving spouse of the decedent and her sole heir because the decedent left the marital home due to medical conditions, and allegations of drunkenness and abuse were undermined by multiple

                    choice with regard to health care services in the Commonwealth, and that accurate and valuable health care data can best be identified by representatives of state government and the consumer, provider, insurance, and business communities.
                    For this reason, the State Board of Health and the State Health Commissioner, assisted by the State Department of Health and the Bureau of Insurance, shall administer the health care data reporting initiatives established by this chapter.

                    <p>
                        The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is required, upon notification, to take charge of a dead body where the death has occurred under any of the circumstances described in subsection A of this section. No other agency is required to take charge of
                        such a dead body or bear the cost of doing so once Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has been notified, as that responsibility is placed exclusively on Office of the Chief Medical Examiner by statute. See opinion of Attorney

                        to make health care decisions on behalf of the prospective donor, shall act for the donor to resolve the conflict. The conflict shall be resolved as expeditiously as possible. Information relevant to the resolution of the conflict
                        may be obtained from the appropriate procurement organization and any other person authorized to make an anatomical gift for the prospective donor under § 32.1-291.9. Before resolution of the conflict, measures necessary to ensure
                        the medical suitability of an organ for transplantation or therapy may not be withheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor if withholding or withdrawing the measures is not contraindicated by appropriate end-of-life care.

                        Acts 2006, c. 166 provides: “Whereas, in past years, the organ procurement organizations and eye banks of Virginia were required to contact the Virginia State Police to have the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records checked for organ and tissue donor
                        designations; however, in 2000, the General Assembly mandated the establishment of an organ and tissue donor registry by the Virginia Transplant Council; and

                    <p>
                        “Whereas, with the budget crisis of 2003, the Virginia Transplant Council lost its funding and its staff while still retaining its statutory responsibilities for the maintenance of the donor registry; and

                    <p>
                        “Whereas, the members of the Virginia Transplant Council have continued to share the costs of maintaining the organ and tissue donor registry; however, funds to maintain the valuable services of the organ and tissue donor registry will soon be depleted,
                        leaving the registry dormant, its usefulness to deteriorate, and eventually causing its closure; and
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Whereas, the donor registry has saved money by eliminating the need to contact the State Police for information held by the Department of Motor Vehicles, thereby freeing up law-enforcement officers for important public safety functions; and

                    <p>
                        “Whereas, analysis of registry data proves that, since its initiation, the donor registry has saved lives by increasing donations and improving family acceptance of organ and tissue donation when the loved one has made an easily ascertainable and verifiable
                        decision; now, therefore,”

                        determining who within a blood line is entitled to claim the body that requires immediate attention. Siver v. Rockingham Mem. Hosp., 48 F. Supp. 2d 608, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6981 (W.D. Va. 1999) (decided under former §

                        and guardians to direct care on behalf of the waiver recipient, when such recipient is incapable of directing such care on his own behalf and (ii) a new waiver for home- and community-based services, as soon as such waiver template
                        shall become available. Any such waiver revision or new waiver shall be cost-neutral and shall expand consumer-directed care in so far as practicable. Any such waiver application shall protect the health and safety of recipients
                        as well as the fiscal integrity of the Commonwealth. Such waiver shall provide for a fiscal agent to handle tax issues and payment of personal attendants on the part of recipients. In addition, any such waiver application shall

                        Under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17) and U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, Virginia justifiably excludes evidence of fair market value other than tax assessments in determining eligibility for Medicaid. The exclusion of such evidence does not deprive applicants of a

                        The Commonwealth’s refusal to deduct the costs of sale incurred by single property owners rests upon a rational policy which compels the disposal of real property only if it results in a fair return to the Medicaid applicant. For this reason, the Commonwealth
                        does not deny applicants equal protection under the Constitution. Harris v. Lukhard, 547 F. Supp. 1015, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15947 (W.D. Va. 1982), aff'd, 733 F.2d 1075, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22914 (4th Cir. 1984).

                    It is the intent of the General Assembly to eliminate the waiting lists for services pursuant to the Intellectual Disability Medicaid Waiver and the Individual and Family Developmental Disabilities and Support Medicaid Waiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In furtherance of this intent, beginning with the fiscal year starting July 1, 2010, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the Department of Medical Assistance Services shall add (i) at least 400 additional funded slots per fiscal year for the Intellectual
                    Disability Medicaid Waiver, and (ii) at least 67 additional funded slots per fiscal year for the Individual and Family Developmental Disabilities and Support Medicaid Waiver, until the waiting lists for the Intellectual Disability
                    Medicaid Waiver and the Individual and Family Developmental Disabilities and Support Medicaid Waiver have been eliminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the Governor shall develop a plan to eliminate the waiting lists for services provided to individuals on the Intellectual Disability Medicaid Waiver and the Individual and Family Developmental Disabilities and Support Medicaid Waiver by the
                    2018-2020 biennium. The plan shall include provisions to reduce the total number of individuals on the waiting list for the Intellectual Disability Medicaid Waiver by 10 percent in the 2008-2010 biennium. The Governor shall submit
                    the plan to the chairman of the Joint Commission on Health Care, and the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations by October 1, 2009.

                        randomly selected patients in a residential treatment program constituted a material breach of the provider agreement between the provider and the agency. Therefore, the agency was entitled to the retraction of payments made to
                        the provider as the agency overpaid for the services provided to Medicaid patients pursuant to the contract with the provider. Psychiatric Solutions of Va., Inc. v. Finnerty, 54 Va. App. 173, 676 S.E.2d 358, 2009

                        Date on which the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services held its first informal factfinding conference (IFFC) with a corporation that was allegedly overpaid under the Medicaid program, governed the issue of whether the Department was barred

                        not recover payments made more than four years before it held its first IFFC was upheld, even though a cost analyst sent a Notice of Program Reimbursement to the corporation within four years after each overpayment was made. Finnerty

                        Subsection B of this section, specifying time limits for the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) to determine overpayments to Medicaid providers, is a mandatory limitation of power that restricts DMAS from seeking return of overpayments after
                        the expiration of a certain time period. Smith v. Liberty Nursing Home, Inc., 31 Va. App. 281, 522 S.E.2d 890, 2000 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 5</cite> (2000).

                        Date on which the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services held its first informal factfinding conference (IFFC) with a corporation that was allegedly overpaid under the Medicaid program, governed the issue of whether the Department was barred
                        by subsection B of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c10a01s32.1-325.1" target="_self">32.1-325.1:1</a></cite> from recovering overpayments; the trial court’s judgment finding that the Department could
                        not recover payments made more than four years before it held its first IFFC on July 6, 2001, was upheld, even though a cost analyst sent a Notice of Program Reimbursement to the corporation within four years after each overpayment
                        was made. Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., 42 Va. App. 628, 593 S.E.2d 568, 2004 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 100</cite> (2004).

                    <p>
                        Because an action was brought as an administrative claim, not a civil action, it was therefore governed by the limitations period specified in subsection B of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c10a01s32.1-325.1" target="_self">32.1-325.1:1</a></cite>,

                    <p>
                        Virginia Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in refusing to order an employer to pay a workers’ compensation claimant’s medical bills because the commission did not have jurisdiction to order the employer to pay a bill that had been paid in full
                        since no right of claimant was involved; the Department of Medical Assistance Services paid a portion of the original bill under the Commonwealth’s provisions for Medicaid coverage, and claimant was not in danger of being charged
                        for the amount adjusted off his bill by the hospital because when the hospital accepted payment from the Department of Medical Assistance Services, it accepted the payment in full satisfaction of its bill. Budnick v. Murphy-Brown,

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that early identification of potential certified nursing facility deficiencies, coupled with the opportunity to correct any such problems, will improve quality of care and life to certified nursing facility residents in the
                    Commonwealth. In order to implement the General Assembly’s finding, early on-site training and assistance shall be provided to certified nursing facilities that are found not in substantial compliance with long-term care requirements
                    and that meet certain requirements as set forth in the Nursing Facility Quality Improvement Program developed pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t32.1c13.1s32.1-353.3" target="_self">32.1-353.3.
  </a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creative and innovative approaches to the provision of long-term care services may also be explored. Such measures can best be accomplished by using the data, expertise, and knowledge of representatives of state government and representatives from the
                    consumer, long-term care provider, and business communities. For this reason, the Board of Medical Assistance Services, assisted by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, shall administer the education initiatives for certified
                    nursing facility care established by this chapter.

                        There is hereby established in the state treasury a special fund to be designated the “Virginia Foundation for Healthy Youth Endowment” (the Endowment). The Endowment shall receive any proceeds from any sale of all or any portion of the Foundation Allocation,
                        deposits from the Fund as determined by the Board pursuant to subdivision 5 of § 32.1-356, and any gifts, grants, and contributions that are specifically designated for inclusion in such Endowment. No part of the Endowment, neither
                        corpus nor income, or interest thereon, shall revert to the general fund of the state treasury. The Endowment shall be under the management and control of the Treasury Board and the Treasury Board shall have such powers and authority
                        as may be necessary to exercise such management and control consistent with the provisions of this section. The income of the Endowment shall be paid out, not less than annually, to the Fund. In addition, up to 10 percent of the
                        corpus of the Endowment shall be paid to the Fund annually upon request of the Board to the Treasury Board; provided, however, that upon two-thirds vote of the Board, up to 15 percent of the corpus of the Endowment shall be so
                        paid. No use of proceeds shall be made that would cause bonds issued on a tax-exempt basis to be considered taxable. For purposes of this section, “income” of the Endowment means at the time of determination the lesser of the available
                        cash in, or the realized investment income for the applicable period of the Endowment, and “corpus” of the endowment means at the time of determination the sum of the proceeds from the sale of all or any portion of the Foundation
                        Allocation, deposits from the Fund as determined by the Board pursuant to subdivision 5 of § 32.1-356, any gifts, grants, and contributions that have been credited to such Endowment, and any income not appropriated and withdrawn
                        from the Endowment before June 30 of each year, less withdrawals from the corpus. Determinations by the Treasury Board, or the State Treasurer on behalf of the Treasury Board, as to the amount of income or the amount of the corpus
                        shall be conclusive.

                        The Treasury Board shall serve as trustee of the Endowment and the corpus and income of the Endowment shall be withdrawn and credited to the Fund by order of the Treasury Board as provided in subsection A. The State Treasurer shall be custodian of the
                        funds credited to the Endowment. The Treasury Board shall have full power to invest and reinvest funds credited to the Endowment in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (§
                        64.2-1100 et seq.) and, in addition, as otherwise provided by law. The Treasury Board may borrow money in such amounts as may be necessary whenever in its judgment it would be more advantageous to borrow money than to sell securities
                        held for the Fund. Any debt so incurred may be evidenced by notes duly authorized by resolution of the Treasury Board, such notes to be retired no later than the end of the biennium in which such debt is incurred. The Treasury
                        Board may commingle, for purposes of investment, the corpus of the Endowment provided that it shall appropriately account for the investments credited to the Endowment. The Treasury Board may hire independent investment advisors

                    personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety. This compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:

                    Prior to disposition of assets, any nonprofit entity shall provide to the Attorney General written notice, on a form provided by the Attorney General, of its intent to dispose of such assets, including the terms of the proposal. The notice shall be given
                    at least 60 days in advance of the effective date of such proposed transaction in order that the Attorney General may exercise his common law and statutory authority over the activities of these organizations. The Attorney General
                    may employ expert assistance in reviewing any proposed transaction, and such reasonable expenses incurred by the Attorney General shall be paid by a party to the proposed transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within 10 days of receipt of the notice from the entity, the Attorney General shall cause a public notice of the transaction to be published in a newspaper in which legal notices may be published in that jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No later than 40 days prior to any disposition of assets, the nonprofit entity shall convene a public meeting to set forth its expectations concerning how the health care needs of the community will be served following the proposed disposition of assets
                    and to receive comments and respond to questions on the potential impact of the proposed disposition of assets on the community served by the nonprofit entity. Notice of the time and place of such meeting shall be published at least
                    10 days prior to the meeting in a newspaper in which legal notices may be published in that jurisdiction.
