                        succeed in achieving monopoly power. Levine v. McLeskey, 881 F. Supp. 1030, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5318 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 164 F.3d 210, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 32621 (4th Cir. 1998).

                        to monopolize is otherwise apparent from the character of the actions taken; but where the actions are ambiguous, the existence and extent of market power may make the inference of specific intent from conduct more or less plausible.

                    Attorney General has a statutorily imposed duty under subsection N of § 59.1-9.10 to maintain the secrecy of all evidence obtained, but the statute also clearly gives the Attorney General discretion to share any such information with any federal or state
                    law-enforcement authority that has restrictions governing confidentiality similar to those contained in this subsection. Commonwealth v. Nexus Servs., 102 Va. Cir. 458, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2473 (Richmond Aug. 7, 2018).

                    Subsection N permits the Attorney General to forward the collected information in his discretion, the court has no authority to override or limit that statute, and the law clearly provided the Attorney General the right to seek the information sought
                    in the civil investigative demand in this case; the Attorney General needed the information to conduct its investigation and names and contact information of individuals who dealt with the business and/or are connected to the bond
                    holders, was pertinent. Commonwealth v. Nexus Servs., 102 Va. Cir. 458, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2473 (Richmond Aug. 7, 2018).

                    Defendant’s demurrer was sustained because plaintiff did not state sufficient facts to support a violation of the Virginia Home Solicitation Sales Act because she failed to sufficiently allege a home solicitation sale as defendant came to plaintiff’s
                    residence at her request to conduct home repair services; and her complaint failed to allege that she agreed to purchase services from defendant when its representative first visited her at her home because the contract for specific
                    services was typed, indicating that it likely was not completed at the time of the initial visit, and the contract was dated almost two months before plaintiff’s dated signature, further proof that she probably did not execute the
                    agreement during the home visit. Theuer v. Norfolk Air Heating &amp; Cooling, Inc., 106 Va. Cir. 113, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 190 (Norfolk Oct. 7, 2020).

       Findings of General Assembly.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds and declares that since the distribution and sales through franchise arrangements of petroleum products in the Commonwealth of Virginia vitally affect the economy of the Commonwealth, the public interest, welfare, and transportation,
                    and since the preservation of the rights, responsibilities, and independence of the small businesses in the Commonwealth is essential to economic vitality, it is necessary to define the relationships and responsibilities of the parties
                    to certain agreements pertaining thereto. Consistent with these findings and declarations, the provisions of § 59.1-21.15:2, which do not relate to the termination or nonrenewal of petroleum franchises governed by federal law, advance
                    the interests of the Commonwealth, and its citizens, by facilitating the purchase of retail service stations by their occupying lessee-franchisees, thereby insuring the motoring public greater access to service stations and petroleum
                    products and furthering a more dynamic and full-service-oriented retail marketplace, while also considering the interests of the franchisor and, if applicable, the property owner, with regard to such service station premises.

                        the trial court erred in failing to strike the indictment on the CD charge, namely § 59.1-41.4, because the acts charged under § 59.1-41.4, standing alone, did not constitute a crime as neither the indictment nor the conviction

                        The main object of the statute is to prevent fraud and to compel an individual or a corporation to disclose the name of the real owner of the business, in order that the person or corporation may sue in or be sued by the proper name. There is a further
                        reason for the enactment of the statute and that is that prospective creditors of the firm or corporation may, by an examination of the lien dockets, determine to whom credit can be extended. Judgments are docketed in the true
                        name of the plaintiff and defendant, and all that is required of an examiner of the lien docket, in order to ascertain against whom a judgment is docketed, is to look for the name of the person or corporation under investigation.

                        Trial court granted the claimant’s motion to amend the named party; due to the named corporation’s failure to file a fictitious name report in Virginia’s public records, the claimant’s efforts to discover the correct entity behind the name and address

                        was a separate entity from the name, as, under §§ 59.1-69 and 59.1-76, an unregistered fictitious name was not automatically a separate entity from the underlying corporation; (2) these provisions did not void acts taken under

                        Defendant’s motion for summary judgment was granted, which asserted it was not the proper defendant, because plaintiff’s negligence complaint suing “Jeff Rorer, d/b/a Mostly Sofa’s” when it should have sued “Faith, Inc.” was more than a misnomer and was
                        not amendable under §

                        When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firm’s failure to register the fictitious name before titling the car did not bar the suit because the non-compliance with
                        § 59.1-69 was eliminated when the firm later registered the fictitious name, after which any bar imposed by § 59.1-76 was removed. Ferris Law Offices, P.C. v. Sonic-Manhattan Fairfax, Inc., 81 Va. Cir. 283, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS

                        When a law firm sued a car dealership for negligence regarding a vehicle that was titled in an unregistered fictitious name, the firm did not lack standing because: (1) the firm’s failure to register the name before titling the car did not show the firm
                        was a separate entity from the name, as, under §§ 59.1-69 and 59.1-76, an unregistered fictitious name was not automatically a separate entity from the underlying corporation; (2) these provisions did not void acts taken under
                        an unregistered fictitious name; and (3) the name’s registration cured any non-registration issue. Ferris Law Offices, P.C. v. Sonic-Manhattan Fairfax, Inc., 81 Va. Cir. 283, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 113 (Fairfax County Oct. 21, 2010).

                        Although the HOT lanes operator had not filed a fictitious name certificate before filing a complaint against defendant for failing to pay tolls and imposing civil penalties, it had subsequently filed the certificate as required by § 59.1-76, and thus,
                        defendant’s motion to dismiss was denied. Transurban v. D'Arco, 92 Va. Cir. 285, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 33 (Fairfax County Feb. 3, 2016).

                        Facts supported a conclusion that a watch producer’s mark, “SWAP,” was not merely descriptive of the feature that parts were interchangeable; individuals had to exercise imagination to connect “SWAP” with that feature, as evidenced by diagrams on ads

                        Plaintiff’s unfair competition law claim survived a motion to dismiss because the fact that defendant attached the labels that it purchased from plaintiff to the bedding products it manufactured increased the likelihood that consumers were confused about
                        the origin of defendant’s products (plaintiff did not have to plead that defendant acted without authorization), and plaintiff had clearly alleged that its marks were distinctive, the marks that defendant used were identical to
                        plaintiff’s marks, defendant used those marks to identify other bedding products, defendant used the marks willfully, and that consumers were likely to be confused by defendant’s use of the marks. Power Mktg. Direct v. Int'l Bedding

                        Service mark infringer’s use of the service mark was likely to cause confusion with the service mark registrant’s suggestive mark since (1) the marks were not only similar, they were identical; (2) the marks were used for the same services, discount funeral
                        services; (3) the market was the same; (4) the marketing media was similar and often identical; and (5) the infringer deliberately infringed upon the registrant’s mark. Old Town Funeral Choices v. N. Va. Funeral Choices, 55 Va.

                        Trial court erred in requiring a customer to elect between his remedies in an action involving the fraudulent sale of an automobile; the case involved causes of action with different elements of proof but a possibility of double recovery, and therefore
                        the customer was entitled to recover compensatory damages on a Virginia Consumer Protection Act, §§ 59.1-196 to 59.1-207, claim, punitive damages on a common-law fraud claim, and attorney’s fees under subsection B of § 59.1-204.

                        company veil of a contractor to hold the debtors, who were members of the limited liability company, liable for the homeowners’ dealings with the contractor, and the homeowners did not establish that the debtors made any false

                        the Supreme Court of Virginia had never squarely addressed the issue, the limiting language of § 59.1-196 and interpretative federal cases appeared to support the position that the Virginia Consumer Protection Act was limited to

                        different elements of proof from a VCPA claim; and increasing the burden on a consumer to bring a VCPA claim by imposing a common law pleading requirement would be contrary to the statutory purpose to expand the remedies afforded
                        to consumers and to relax the restrictions imposed upon them by the common law. West v. Christopher Consultants, 106 Va. Cir. 6, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 82 (Loudoun County June 10, 2020).

                        In a service mark infringement case seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief in which count IV of the complaint alleged a violation of § 59.1-200 and the alleged infringer argued that the holders lacked standing to prosecute that claim, while
                        the Supreme Court of Virginia had never squarely addressed the issue, the limiting language of § 59.1-196 and interpretative federal cases appeared to support the position that the Virginia Consumer Protection Act was limited to
                        consumer transactions. Diamonds Direct USA, Inc. v. BFJ Holdings, Inc., No. 3:12CV303-HEH, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90222 (E.D. Va. June 28, 2012).

                        Although the court determined that a body shop was negligent in its failure to follow statutory procedures in auctioning an owner’s car, the lien valuation and auction procedures did not constitute a “consumer transaction” with respect to the owner, as

                        to sell vehicles on consignment, and the check for the sale was made out in plaintiff’s name and he deposited it into his personal bank account. Futrell v. POS Auto Sales, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 1, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 309 (Spotsylvania

                        The Virginia Consumer Protection Act inarguably applies to those consumer transactions involving services and/or goods which are ultimately intended for personal use; the language of § 59.1-198 does not seem to limit protection only to those transactions

                        Both Virginia common and statutory law provide for an insurance company’s right to subrogation where the insured’s loss allegedly was caused by a third party’s negligent or tortious conduct. Subsection D, while exempting insurance companies from suit
                        under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, is silent with respect to subrogation rights. Consequently, the act should not serve to nullify the Virginia common and statutory law permitting an insurance company a right to subrogation,

                        Requirement of licensure for non-commercial lenders doing business in Virginia is not a discriminatory restraint on trade, but rather a prudent exercise of the constitutional police power to regulate fraudulent activity; this general obligation to obtain

                        Virginia Consumer Protection Act; the qualifier phrase bestowing exemption from the Act applies only to the listed entities specified in subsection D of § 59.1-199, all of which are of a financial “class,” as long as they are both

                        Car buyers sued a bank, which was the assignee of a financing contract, alleging violations of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. Though subsection D specifically exempted banks from liability under the Act, a holder clause in the financing agreement

                        Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), § 59.1-200 et seq., specifically § 59.1-204, as consistently construed by the courts, requires that a private VCPA claimant show that he relied on the alleged misrepresentations claimed to constitute the prohibited
                        practice, and thus that his loss was caused by the prohibited practice. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that a debtor was required to prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations of his creditors to recover
                        under the VCPA. Cooper v. GGGR Invs., LLC, 334 Bankr. 179, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32333 (E.D. Va. 2005).

                        Trial court did not err in allowing the buyers to pursue a claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., where subsection A of § 59.1-199 exempted only those aspects of a consumer transaction that were sanctioned by statute or
                        regulation and thus the dealer was not entitled to exemption from the claim on the sole ground that motor vehicle dealer advertising was regulated by other statutory provisions and regulations. Manassas Autocars, Inc. v. Couch,

                        Based on the plain language of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), § 59.1-196 et seq., it was unlawful to misrepresent that goods were of a particular standard, quality, grade, style, or model, under subdivision A 6 of § 59.1-200; that duty not
                        to misrepresent the quality, grade, or style of goods is a statutory duty that existed independent of the contracts entered into between the parties to the litigation, the duty was not one existing between the parties solely by
                        virtue of the contract. Because the purchasers alleged that the company breached a duty existing independent of the contracts, the trial court erred when it sustained the company’s demurrers to the purchasers’ VCPA claims. Abi-Najm

                        rights, personal freedoms, health, safety, or welfare; therefore, a former employee, who was terminated for refusing to participate in an allegedly fraudulent sales scheme, failed to state a claim for wrongful termination because
                        the VCPA did not provide a public policy basis for such a claim and, even if it did, the employee was not within the protective reach of the VCPA since he was an employee and not a consumer. Lucker v. Cole Vision Corp., No. 7:05CV00126,

                        was essentially a verbatim recitation of prohibited practices under that statute, defendant’s demurrer on this ground was overruled. Futrell v. POS Auto Sales, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 1, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 309 (Spotsylvania County Sept.

                        An application for an investigative order must show that there is “reasonable cause to believe” that a violation of the act has occurred, is occurring or will occur; this “reasonable cause” standard requires less than the probable cause standard and does

                        court can issue a civil investigative order; this statutory scheme does not impose a two-step compliance process and the commonwealth is not required to make a factual showing under subsection A that it had reasonable cause to
                        believe that a violation of the consumer protection act had occurred, was occurring or would occur, and that it had made a good faith effort to acquire the desired information and was unsuccessful, or that it was impractical to

                        Trial court erred in requiring a customer to elect between his remedies in an action involving the fraudulent sale of an automobile; the case involved causes of action with different elements of proof but a possibility of double recovery, and therefore
                        the customer was entitled to recover compensatory damages on a Virginia Consumer Protection Act, §§ 59.1-196 to 59.1-207, claim, punitive damages on a common-law fraud claim, and attorney’s fees under subsection B of § 59.1-204.

                        Virginia Consumer Protection Act (VCPA), § 59.1-200 et seq., and specifically this section, as consistently construed by the courts, requires that a private VCPA claimant show that he relied on the alleged misrepresentations claimed to constitute the
                        prohibited practice, and thus that his loss was caused by the prohibited practice. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court correctly concluded that a debtor was required to prove reliance on the alleged misrepresentations of his creditors
                        to recover under the VCPA. Cooper v. GGGR Invs., LLC, 334 Bankr. 179, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32333 (E.D. Va. 2005).

                        A 1 or A 14 of § 59.1-200, the debtor did not contend that the use of another name in the solicitation or the failure to disclose the creditor’s interest would have affected his decision; therefore, the bankruptcy court’s factual

                        Elements of a misrepresentation claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-196 et seq., as set forth in subdivision A 14 of § 59.1-200, were congruent with those required for nondischargeability under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(2)(A). To the extent
                        that the Act could be violated by conduct short of a willful intent to deceive, that element was supplied by an award of enhanced damages under subsection A of § 59.1-204, which required that the violation be willful. Grey-Theriot

                        Where a bankruptcy court determined that an award of actual damages, enhanced damages, and attorney’s fees under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(2)(A), it lacked jurisdiction to award the creditor attorney’s
                        fees over and above those awarded by the state court pursuant to subsection B of § 59.1-204. Grey-Theriot v. Quansah (In re Quansah), No. 10-12304-SSM, No. 10-1260, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1319 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Apr. 9, 2011).

                        Car dealer’s demurrer to a buyer’s claim under the Virginia Consumer Protection Law (Lemon Law), § 59.1-196 et seq., claim was overruled as the buyer pled fraudulent concealment and recounted allegedly false statements made by a salesman; the phrase “should
                        have known,” occurred only along with alternative language suggesting that the dealer was conscious of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations. The conclusion that the buyer stated a claim under § 59.1-196 was bolstered by the
                        fact that § 59.1-207 explicitly reserved remedies for individuals aggrieved as a result of an unintentional violation. Sykes v. Brady-Bushey Ford, Inc., 69 Va. Cir. 219, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 323 (Charlottesville Oct. 27, 2005).

                    The General Assembly recognizes that a motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase, and there is no doubt that a defective motor vehicle creates a hardship for the consumer. It is the intent of the General Assembly that a good faith motor vehicle warranty
                    complaint by a consumer should be resolved by the manufacturer, or its agent, within a specified period of time. It is further the intent of the General Assembly to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a
                    replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the express warranty issued by the manufacturer. However, nothing in this chapter shall in any way limit the rights or remedies
                    which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.

                        In consumers’ action against a manufacturer for alleged violations of the Virginia Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act (Act), arising from an allegedly defective valve in a motor home, the court would not reconsider its discovery order that directed
                        the manufacturer to remove and replace the valve for testing purposes because the replacement of the valve was not prohibited by the Act. In fact, whether the valve was replaced was irrelevant to the consumers’ claim under the
                        Act because the 18-month period for the manufacturer to repair the motor home had expired; thus, if the consumers proved that the manufacturer violated the Act, even if the replacement of the valve repaired the motor home, the
                        consumers’ remedy under the Act was fixed. Parks v. Newmar Corp., No. 6:04-CV-00013, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18373 (W.D. Va. Aug. 26, 2005).

                    claim for a full refund less an allowance for use, and a notice of intent to file suit if the company did not respond in ten days. Nikolov v. Ford Motor Co., 104 Va. Cir. 327, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 67 (Norfolk Mar. 12, 2020).

                    Informal dispute settlement procedure under Virginia law need not be as detailed as 16 C.F.R. Part 703; however, at a minimum, it must have some agreed upon submission to the decision of a neutral person selected by the manufacturer. Nikolov v. Ford Motor

                        Agreements were lease-purchase agreements and not security interests under Virginia law where agreements were for an initial period of a month, were automatically renewable with each payment, could be terminated at any time without paying any charges
                        other than previously due, and permitted the debtors to become the owners of the subject property; accordingly, the bankruptcy court sustained the creditor’s objection to the debtors’ Chapter 13 plan that treated the agreements
                        as security interests rather than as leases that were required to be either affirmed or rejected under 11 U.S.C.S. § 365. In re Muse, No. 02-62169-T, 2002 Bankr. LEXIS 1807 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Sept. 30, 2002).

                    before committing themselves to exhibiting it in their communities.

                    is intended to be a source of targeted lending and investment with the capacity to provide a high degree of leveraging for economic development and housing activities within distressed communities throughout the Commonwealth. These
                    activities may include mortgage financing for first-time buyers, financing for needed community facilities, commercial loans and investments to start or expand small businesses, loans to rehabilitate rental housing, and financial services
                    needed by low-income households and local businesses. The CDFI may also provide services that help ensure that credit is used effectively, such as technical assistance to small businesses and credit counseling to consumers.”

                        full-time job, and $25,000 per $1 million of capital investment, not to exceed a total aggregate award of $10.5 million. Grants are intended to pay or to reimburse the qualified company for the costs of workforce development, workforce
                        recruitment, and instructional or training purposes. The qualified company may use the award for any lawful purpose.“Memorandum of understanding” means a performance agreement or related document entered into on or before August

                        at the facility prior to May 1, 2017. The Commonwealth may gauge compliance with the new full-time jobs requirements for the qualified company by reference to the new payroll generated by a qualified company, as indicated in a
                        memorandum of understanding.“Qualified company” means an e-commerce company, including its affiliates, that between May 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022, is expected to (i) make a capital investment at a facility of at least $84

                        As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:“Capital investment” means an expenditure by or on behalf of a qualified company on or after March 1, 2019, in real property, tangible personal property, or both, at a facility in
                        an eligible county that is properly chargeable to a capital account or would be so chargeable with a proper election. The purchase or lease of furniture; fixtures; business personal property; machinery and tools, including under
                        an operating lease; and expected building expansion and up-fit by or on behalf of a qualified company shall qualify as capital investment.“Eligible county” means Rockingham County.“Facility” means the building, group of buildings,
                        or corporate campus, including any related machinery and tools, furniture, fixtures, and business personal property, that is located at or near a qualified company’s existing operations in an eligible county and is owned, leased,
                        licensed, occupied, or otherwise operated by a qualified company for use in the administration, management, and operation of its business.“Fund” means the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Grant Fund.“Grants” means grants from the Fund
                        awarded to a qualified company in an aggregate not to exceed $7.5 million, intended to be used to pay or reimburse a qualified company for the costs of workforce recruitment, development, and training, and for stormwater management.
                        A qualified company may use the grant payment for any lawful purpose.“Memorandum of understanding” means a performance agreement or related document entered into on or before August 1, 2020, by a qualified company, the Commonwealth,
                        and VEDP, that sets forth the requirements for capital investment and the creation of new full-time jobs by a qualified company in order for a qualified company to be eligible for grants from the Fund.“New full-time job” means
                        a job position, in which the employee of a qualified company works at a facility, for which the average annual wage is at least $100,000 and the qualified company provides standard fringe benefits. Such position shall require a

                        positions, and positions created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth, shall not qualify as new full-time jobs. “New full-time job” shall not include any existing full-time positions at the
                        facility as of March 1, 2019. The Commonwealth may gauge compliance with the new full-time job requirements for a qualified company by reference to the new payroll generated by a qualified company, as indicated in the memorandum
                        of understanding.“Qualified company” means a company, including its affiliates, that engages in pharmaceutical manufacturing in an eligible county and that, between March 1, 2019, and February 28, 2025, is expected to make (i)
                        a capital investment of at least $1 billion and (ii) create at least 152 new full-time jobs related to, or supportive of, its business.“Secretary” means the Secretary of Commerce and Trade or his designee.“VEDP” means the Virginia
                        Economic Development Partnership Authority.

                    For purposes of this chapter, a health club shall be considered a new health club and subject to the requirements of a bond or letter of credit at the time the health club changes ownership. Any health club that has more than 50 percent ownership by the
                    same person or persons shall be considered as owned by the same owner. A change in ownership shall not release, cancel, or terminate liability under any bond or letter of credit previously filed unless the Commissioner agrees in writing
                    to such release, cancellation, or termination because the new owner has filed a new bond or letter of credit for the benefit of the previous owner’s members or because the former owner has refunded all unearned payments to its members.
                    Every change in ownership shall be reported in writing to the Commissioner at least 10 days prior to the effective date of the change in ownership.

                    DANGER: ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION Repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation may cause chronic sun damage to the skin characterized by wrinkling, dryness, fragility, and bruising of the skin, and skin cancer. Failure to use protective eyewear may result in
                    severe burns or permanent injury to the eyes. Medications or cosmetics may increase your sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. Consult a physician or nurse practitioner before using a sunlamp if you are using medications, have a history
                    of skin problems, or believe you are especially sensitive to sunlight. Pregnant women or women taking oral contraceptives who use this product may develop discolored skin. IF YOU DO NOT TAN IN THE SUN, YOU WILL NOT TAN FROM USE OF
                    AN ULTRAVIOLET SUNLAMP. B. A tanning facility shall post a warning sign, one sign for each tanning device, in a conspicuous location that is readily readable to a person about to use the device. The sign shall contain the following:
                    DANGER: ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION 1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use of this device. 2. Avoid too frequent or lengthy exposure. As with natural sunlight, exposure can cause serious eye and skin injuries and allergic reactions.
                    Repeated exposure may cause skin cancer. 3. Wear protective eyewear. Failure to use protective eyewear may result in severe burns or permanent damage to the eyes. 4. Do not sunbathe before or after exposure to ultraviolet radiation
                    from sunlamps. 5. Medications or cosmetics may increase your sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation. Consult a physician or nurse practitioner before using a sunlamp if you are using medication, have a history of skin problems, or believe
                    you are especially sensitive to sunlight. Pregnant women or women using oral contraceptives who use this product may develop discolored skin. IF YOU DO NOT TAN IN THE SUN, YOU WILL NOT TAN FROM USE OF THIS DEVICE.

                            Under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, §§ 59.1-336 through 59.1-343, plaintiff had the burden to prove by a preponderance of evidence that defendants misappropriated its trade secrets; the Act did not shift the burden to defendants, once plaintiff
                            made out a prima facie case, to prove that their product was independently derived. MicroStrategy Inc. v. Li,

                            Defendants were properly granted summary judgment on plaintiff corporations’ Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim because the claim relied exclusively on allegations and inferences instead of any sort of actual objective evidence; while defendants

                            the parties’ software designs and the employees’ ability to develop the competitor’s software from public sources, the record supported the chancellor’s finding that the employees and competitor did not misappropriate plaintiff’s

                            In plaintiff’s action against defendant alleging misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act, issuance of a preliminary injunction was appropriate because plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits where
                            (1) its proprietary information, including software and software documentation resided in Virginia; (2) the information and the sublicense constituted trade secrets because plaintiff had taken reasonable measures to safeguard
                            the information and competitors would economically benefit from receiving this proprietary information; and (3) defendant’s alleged acquisition of plaintiff’s trade secrets through improper means constituted the definition
                            of misappropriation because defendant’s alleged access to the information was obtained without consent or authorization. Datatel, Inc. v. Rose &amp; Tuck, LLC, No. 05-495, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29704 (E.D. Va. June 17, 2005).

                            confidential business information about a manufacturing process and the company’s business plans, was trade secret information under § 59.1-336. As a result, a jury could not make a damage award for the conversion of confidential,

                        Jurisdiction over the instant motion to dissolve the injunction existed without regard to the status of the pending appeal because the question of the injunctive relief ordered by the court was not on appeal. The Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5) motion filed
                        by defendants did not duplicate an appeal but merely asked that the court find that it was no longer equitable to enforce the injunction based on changed circumstances; a finding by the court that the injunction should have terminated
                        based on a finding that the two documents were no longer trade secrets did not complicate issues on appeal as the question of the appropriateness of injunctive relief was not on appeal. MicroStrategy, Inc. v. Business Objects,

                        Although defendants produced some evidence that pertained to economic value, it largely relied on argument concerning the age and staleness of the documents and in the absence of other evidence that the documents at issue would cease to be economically
                        valuable or would become publicly available and considering that the injunction was only in place for nine months, the court could not find that the documents ceased to be trade secrets or that any commercial advantage dissipated

                        Materials did not derive independent value and were largely available through the government, and thus plaintiff’s claim for misappropriation of trade secrets failed; many of the materials, regardless of how they were ultimately acquired, were developed
                        in support of plaintiff’s prior government contract, thereby making them government property. As property not in plaintiff’s exclusive dominion, the materials remained readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who
                        could obtain economic value from their disclosure. Futrend Tech., Inc. v. MicroHealth LLC, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 128 (Fairfax County Aug. 21, 2020).

                        Reasonable royalty focuses on the approximation of the actual value of the infringed secret to the defendant, relying on the fiction that a license was to be granted at the time of beginning the infringement, and then determining what the license price

                        While defendant’s use of the list was reprehensible and illegal, it was not a serious breach of loyalty, and it did not seriously harm the plaintiff. His ultimate motive was to contact strong potential clients and develop his own business, not to ruin
                        plaintiff’s. Plaintiff did not show that defendant acted with conscious disregard for plaintiffs rights, only that defendant acted with anger and used information it should not have. Therefore, the court could not find that defendant’s

                        Plaintiff filed its copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets claims well within the three year statute of limitations requirement, because its case rested on defendant’s bid which advertised defendant’s extensive experience working
                        with plaintiff’s products and tools. Although defendant claimed that plaintiff’s case fell outside the statute of limitations because one of the contracts between the parties was more than three years ago, the misappropriation
                        of trade secrets did not occur until the year that plaintiff filed suit. Datatel, Inc. v. Rose &amp; Tuck, LLC, No. 05-495, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29704 (E.D. Va. June 17, 2005).

                        Trade secrets claim was untimely because the alleged misappropriation could have been discovered earlier. Even if the claimant did not know that a former employee had disclosed supplier contact information that was one of its trade secrets, it knew that
                        another company had acquired the information, and it could have taken reasonable steps to learn how that happened. Thousand Oaks Barrel Co., LLC v. Deep South Barrels LLC, 241 F. Supp. 3d 708, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40011 (E.D.

                        The plain language of this preemption provision indicates that the law was intended to prevent inconsistent theories of relief for the same underlying harm by eliminating alternative theories of common-law recovery which are premised on the misappropriation
                        of a trade secret. Smithfield Ham &amp; Prods. Co. v. Portion Pac, Inc., 905 F. Supp. 346, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17891 (E.D. Va. 1995).

                        Unless it can be clearly discerned that the information in question constitutes a trade secret, a court cannot dismiss alternative theories of relief as preempted by the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act; thus, where the parties dispute whether allegedly
                        misappropriated confidential information constituted trade secrets, a court will not find alternative claims preempted by the act. Stone Castle Fin., Inc. v. Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Co., 191 F. Supp. 2d 652, 2002 U.S.

                        Insurance company’s claims against a former regional manager for tortious interference with contractual and/or prospective business relations and breach of fiduciary duties were not preempted by § 59.1-341 because the claims for tortious interference
                        and breach of fiduciary duties were not entirely dependent on the manager’s alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The claims for tortious interference and breach of fiduciary duties were based, in part, on the allegation that
                        the manager solicited the manager’s coworkers to leave the insurance company to work for a competitor, and the insurance company did not allege that the identities of the coworkers were uncovered solely through the misappropriation
                        of trade secrets. Combined Ins. Co. of Am. v. Wiest, 578 F. Supp. 2d 822, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61436 (W.D. Va. 2008).

                        Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act did not preempt plaintiff’s conspiracy and other tort claims because those claims were not predicated entirely upon defendant’s alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus.,

                        Defendant’s business conspiracy and common-law conspiracy claims would not be dismissed because applying the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act’s preemption provision would be premature as the court could not conclusively determine whether the information
                        was a trade secret without the benefit of a factual record, and the court declined to enlarge the reach of Uniform Trade Secrets Act’s statutory preemption to include confidential business information. Microstrategy Servs. Corp.

                        Plaintiffs’ allegations were not premised entirely on a claim for the misappropriation of a trade secret, it was merely a component of the conspiracy, and thus plaintiffs’ claims were not preempted under the Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act; although
                        the plaintiffs cited the misappropriation of trade secrets, their claims were not wholly reliant thereon and the demurrer was consequently overruled. Rogers Elec. of Va., Ltd. v. Sims, 93 Va. Cir. 484, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 239 (Chesapeake

                        to effect the purposes of this chapter. Such regulations shall include provisions that all simulcast horse racing shall comply with the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. § 3001 et seq.) and shall require the holder
                        of a license to schedule no more than 125 live racing days in the Commonwealth each calendar year; however, the Commission shall have the authority to alter the required number of live racing days based on what the Commission deems
                        to be in the best interest of the Virginia horse industry. Such regulations shall authorize up to 10 satellite facilities and restrict majority ownership of satellite facilities to an entity licensed by the Commission that is a
                        significant infrastructure limited licensee, or if by August 1, 2015, there is no such licensee or a pending application for such license, then the nonprofit industry stakeholder organization recognized by the Commission may be

                        a significant infrastructure limited licensee pursuant to § 59.1-376, then such limited licensee may own or operate the remaining available satellite facilities authorized in accordance with this subdivision. In no event shall
                        the Commission authorize any such entities to own or operate more than a combined total of 10 satellite facilities. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to preclude private local ownership or participation in any satellite
                        facility. Except as authorized pursuant to subdivision 5, wagering on simulcast horse racing shall take place only at a licensed horse racetrack or satellite facility.

                <p>
                    A referendum on the question of whether pari-mutuel wagering should be permitted at a licensed racetrack and/or satellite facilities must be presented to the qualified voters of a county or city. Voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering on live horse racing
                    at a licensed racetrack constitutes voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast horse racing at that licensed racetrack; however, voter approval of pari-mutuel wagering at a licensed racetrack does not constitute voter approval
                    of pari-mutuel wagering at satellite facilities. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert G. Marshall, Member, House of Delegates, 99-084, 2000 Va. AG LEXIS 13 (2/11/00).

                        Written material pertaining to gifts must disclose specific material, including the actual retail value of the item or prize. Where the actual values of the gifts were not disclosed, but rather, the consumers were led to believe the costs of the items
                        were as the consumers themselves had estimated, and where sales representatives wrote down the price the consumers had estimated and made no effort to change the price to the actual value or make the consumers aware that their
                        estimation was incorrect, this section was violated. In re Fravel, 143 Bankr. 1001, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 1215 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1992).

                <p>
                    “Alternate operator services provider” means a telecommunications company, other than a local exchange company or interexchange company certificated by the State Corporation Commission or an affiliate or agent of such a company, which provides intrastate
                    long distance operator assisted services where human or automated call intervention is necessary for obtaining billing information from the end-user. However, this exception for local exchange companies and interexchange companies
                    applies only where the rates charged are those of the local exchange company or interexchange company on file with the State Corporation Commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Person” means individual and entity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Public telephone equipment provider” means any person who makes available for public use telephone equipment with access to the public switched network where a charge is made to the user for such use and intrastate local or long distance service is provided
                    through such equipment by an alternate operator services provider. This includes but is not limited to hotels, motels, airports, baccalaureate institutions of higher education, hospitals, and coin-operated telephone equipment either
                    privately owned or furnished by local exchange and interstate long distance telephone companies.

                    The terms of the home service contract dictate whether a home service contract provider is considered to be a contractor. Should a provider be considered to be a contractor, he must be licensed as a contractor pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 54.1. See

                        by § 59.1-439 to determine if the obligor or its insurance company, if complying with subsection B, has improperly denied or failed to honor a purchaser’s request. If the Commissioner determines that a purchaser’s request was improperly
                        denied or failed to be honored by an obligor or its insurance company, if complying with subsection B, the Commissioner may issue an order requiring the obligor to rectify or justify the denial or failure. In addition to the penalties
                        provided in § 59.1-441, if the denial or failure is not rectified or sufficiently justified by the obligor, the Commissioner may (i) issue a cease and desist order requiring the obligor to cease operations in the Commonwealth until
                        the denial or failure has been rectified; (ii) deny, suspend, or revoke the obligor’s registration; or (iii) assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per violation not to exceed $10,000 in the aggregate for all similar violations.
                        Any civil penalties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be payable to the State Treasurer for deposit to the general fund. If the Commissioner elects to assess such a civil penalty and an obligor does not pay the civil

                        Although the possibility that communicating Social Security numbers might be found unprotected in other situations was not foreclosed, on the instant facts, the First Amendment did reach plaintiff’s publication of Virginia land records containing unredacted
                        SSNs; the First Amendment did not allow Virginia to punish plaintiff for posting its land records online without redacting SSNs when numerous clerks were doing precisely that. Virginia’s failure to redact SSNs before placing land
                        records online meant that barring plaintiff’s protected speech would not be narrowly tailored to Virginia’s interest in protecting individual privacy; therefore enforcing § 59.1-443.2 against plaintiff for the Virginia land records
                        posted on her website violated the First Amendment. Ostergren v. Cuccinelli, 615 F.3d 263, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15254 (4th Cir. 2010).

                        District court abused its discretion by not tailoring the scope of the remedy to fit the nature and extent of the constitutional violation; on remand the district court would require a more developed factual record to determine proper injunctive relief,
                        which included evidence about the status and effectiveness of Virginia’s redaction efforts. Depending on the scope of § 59.1-443.2, this could also include evidence about non-Virginia public records that plaintiff would publish
                        on her website; because the constitutional analysis turned on how Virginia has handled public records rather than on whose social security numbers were being exposed, the district court should frame the injunctive relief accordingly.

                        Persuasive legal arguments exist to assert that the portion of the Virginia civil identity protection statute prohibiting the intentional communication of an individual’s social security number, as contained in subdivision A 1 of § 59.1-443.2, is not
                        preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Under facts identical to those presented in Fisher v. Communications Workers of America , 716 S.E.2d 396 (N.C. App. 2011), it is likely that Virginia’s courts would reach the same
                        result. In the more likely event of labor relations litigation arising on different facts, a much stronger prospect exists to successfully defeat a federal preemption claim. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Richard
                        H. Black, Member, Senate of Virginia, 12-107, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 24 (4/12/13).

                        In an action before the court pursuant to § 59.1-475 et seq. seeking approval of the proposed transfer of certain structured settlement proceeds payable to an Illinois resident, Virginia had no interest in the matter that would compel it to ignore the

                    Although no law requires the acceptance of mailed voter registration applications with electronic signatures, the State Board of Elections is not precluded from directing that general registrars accept such applications, and the State Board, in its discretion,
                    may do so. The State Board also has discretionary authority to establish criteria to preserve the security of confidential voter information and to ensure the authenticity and validity of electronic signatures. See opinion of Attorney

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the advent of electronic means of communication and information transfer, business models and methods for doing business have evolved to take advantage of the speed, efficiencies, and cost benefits of electronic technologies. These developments have
                        occurred in the face of existing legal barriers to the legal efficacy of records and documents which exist solely in electronic media. Whether the legal requirement that information or an agreement or contract must be contained
                        or set forth in a pen and paper writing derives from a statute of frauds affecting the enforceability of an agreement, or from a record retention statute that calls for keeping the paper record of a transaction, such legal requirements
                        raise real barriers to the effective use of electronic media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One striking example of electronic barriers involves so called check retention statutes in every State. A study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston identified more than 2500 different state laws which require the retention of canceled checks
                        by the issuers of those checks. These requirements not only impose burdens on the issuers, but also effectively restrain the ability of banks handling the checks to automate the process. Although check truncation is validated under
                        the Uniform Commercial Code, if the bank’s customer must store the canceled paper check, the bank will not be able to deal with the item through electronic transmission of the information. By establishing the equivalence of an
                        electronic record of the information, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) removes these barriers without affecting the underlying legal rules and requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to understand that the purpose of the UETA is to remove barriers to electronic commerce by validating and effectuating electronic records and signatures. It is NOT a general contracting statute — the substantive rules of contracts remain
                        unaffected by UETA. Nor is it a digital signature statute. To the extent that a State has a Digital Signature Law, the UETA is designed to support and compliment that statute.

                            Scope of the Act and Procedural Approach.  The scope of this Act provides coverage which sets forth a clear framework for covered transactions, and also avoids unwarranted surprises for unsophisticated parties dealing in this relatively new media. The
                            clarity and certainty of the scope of the Act have been obtained while still providing a solid legal framework that allows for the continued development of innovative technology to facilitate electronic transactions.
                        </li>

                            Procedural Approach.  Another fundamental premise of the Act is that it be minimalist and procedural. The general efficacy of existing law in an electronic context, so long as biases and barriers to the medium are removed, validates this approach. The
                            Act defers to existing substantive law. Specific areas of deference to other law in this Act include: (1) the meaning and effect of “sign” under existing law, (2) the method and manner of displaying, transmitting and formatting
                            information in Section 8, [§ 59.1-486] (3) rules of attribution in Section 9 [§ 59.1-487], and (4) the law of mistake in Section 10 [§ 59.1-488].
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        With regard to the general scope of the Act, the Act’s coverage is inherently limited by the definition of “transaction.” The Act does not apply to all writings and signatures, but only to electronic records and signatures relating to a transaction, defined
                        as those interactions between people relating to business, commercial and governmental affairs. In general, there are few writing or signature requirements imposed by law on many of the “standard” transactions that had been considered
                        for exclusion. A good example relates to trusts, where the general rule on creation of a trust imposes no formal writing requirement. Further, the writing requirements in other contexts derived from governmental filing issues.
                        For example, real estate transactions were considered potentially troublesome because of the need to file a deed or other instrument for protection against third parties. Since the efficacy of a real estate purchase contract, or
                        even a deed, between the parties is not affected by any sort of filing, the question was raised why these transactions should not be validated by this Act if done via an electronic medium. No sound reason was found. Filing requirements
                        fall within Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] on governmental records. An exclusion of all real estate transactions would be particularly unwarranted in the event that a State chose to convert to an electronic recording
                        system, as many have for Article 9 financing statement filings under the Uniform Commercial Code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exclusion of specific Articles of the Uniform Commercial Code reflects the recognition that, particularly in the case of Articles 5, 8 and revised Article 9, electronic transactions were addressed in the specific contexts of those revision processes.
                        In the context of Articles 2 and 2A the UETA provides the vehicle for assuring that such transactions may be accomplished and effected via an electronic medium. At such time as Articles 2 and 2A are revised the extent of coverage
                        in those Articles/Acts may make application of this Act as a gap-filling law desirable. Similar considerations apply to the recently promulgated Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (“UCITA”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The need for certainty as to the scope and applicability of this Act is critical, and makes any sort of a broad, general exception based on notions of inconsistency with existing writing and signature requirements unwise at best. The uncertainty inherent
                        in leaving the applicability of the Act to judicial construction of this Act with other laws is unacceptable if electronic transactions are to be facilitated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, recognition that the paradigm for the Act involves two willing parties conducting a transaction electronically, makes it necessary to expressly provide that some form of acquiescence or intent on the part of a person to conduct transactions electronically
                        is necessary before the Act can be invoked. Accordingly, Section 5 [§ 59.1-483] specifically provides that the Act only applies between parties that have agreed to conduct transactions electronically. In this context, the construction
                        of the term agreement must be broad in order to assure that the Act applies whenever the circumstances show the parties’ intention to transact electronically, regardless of whether the intent rises to the level of a formal agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Act’s treatment of records and signatures demonstrates best the minimalist approach that has been adopted. Whether a record is attributed to a person is left to law outside this Act. Whether an electronic signature has any effect is left to the surrounding
                        circumstances and other law. These provisions are salutary directives to assure that records and signatures will be treated in the same manner, under currently existing law, as written records and manual signatures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The deference of the Act to other substantive law does not negate the necessity of setting forth rules and standards for using electronic media. The Act expressly validates electronic records, signatures and contracts. It provides for the use of electronic
                        records and information for retention purposes, providing certainty in an area with great potential in cost savings and efficiency. The Act makes clear that the actions of machines (“electronic agents”) programmed and used by people
                        will bind the user of the machine, regardless of whether human review of a particular transaction has occurred. It specifies the standards for sending and receipt of electronic records, and it allows for innovation in financial
                        services through the implementation of transferable records. In these ways the Act permits electronic transactions to be accomplished with certainty under existing substantive rules of law.

                    may do so. The State Board also has discretionary authority to establish criteria to preserve the security of confidential voter information and to ensure the authenticity and validity of electronic signatures. See opinion of Attorney

         “Agreement.”
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Whether the parties have reached an agreement is determined by their express language and all surrounding circumstances. The Restatement 2d Contracts § 3 provides that, “An agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent on the part of two or more persons.”
                            See also Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 2, Comment b. The Uniform Commercial Code specifically includes in the circumstances from which an agreement may be inferred “course of performance, course of dealing andusage of trade
                            . . .” as defined in the UCC. Although the definition of agreement in this Act does not make specific reference to usage of trade and other party conduct, this definition is not intended to affect the construction of the parties’
                            agreement under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction. Where that law takes account of usage and conduct in informing the terms of the parties’ agreement, the usage or conduct would be relevant as “other
                            circumstances” included in the definition under this Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the law applicable to a given transaction provides that system rules and the like constitute part of the agreement of the parties, such rules will have the same effect in determining the parties’ agreement under this Act. For example, UCC Article
                            4 (Section 4-103(b)) provides that Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars and clearinghouse rules have the effect of agreements. Such agreements by law properly would be included in the definition of agreement
                            in this Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The parties’ agreement is relevant in determining whether the provisions of this Act have been varied by agreement. In addition, the parties’ agreement may establish the parameters of the parties’ use of electronic records and signatures, security procedures
                            and similar aspects of the transaction. See Model Trading Partner Agreement, 45 Business Lawyer Supp. Issue (June 1990). See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)] and Comments thereto.

         “Automated Transaction.”
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            An automated transaction is a transaction performed or conducted by electronic means in which machines are used without human intervention to form contracts and perform obligations under existing contracts. Such broad coverage is necessary because of
                            the diversity of transactions to which this Act may apply.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As with electronic agents, this definition addresses the circumstance where electronic records may result in action or performance by a party although no human review of the electronic records is anticipated. Section 14 [§ 59.1-492] provides specific
                            rules to assure that where one or both parties do not review the electronic records, the resulting agreement will be effective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The critical element in this definition is the lack of a human actor on one or both sides of a transaction. For example, if one orders books from Bookseller.com through Bookseller’s website, the transaction would be an automated transaction because Bookseller
                            took and confirmed the order via its machine. Similarly, if Automaker and supplier do business through Electronic Data Interchange, Automaker’s computer, upon receiving information within certain pre-programmed parameters,
                            will send an electronic order to supplier’s computer. If Supplier’s computer confirms the order and processes the shipment because the order falls within pre-programmed parameters in Supplier’s computer, this would be a fully
                            automated transaction. If, instead, the Supplier relies on a human employee to review, accept, and process the Buyer’s order, then only the Automaker’s side of the transaction would be automated. In either case, the entire
                            transaction falls within this definition.

                            The basic nature of most current technologies and the need for a recognized, single term warrants the use of “electronic” as the defined term. The definition is intended to assure that the Act will be applied broadly as new technologies develop. The term
                            must be construed broadly in light of developing technologies in order to fulfill the purpose of this Act to validate commercial transactions regardless of the medium used by the parties. Current legal requirements for “writings”
                            can be satisfied by almost any tangible media, whether paper, other fibers, or even stone. The purpose and applicability of this Act covers intangible media which are technologically capable of storing, transmitting and reproducing
                            information in human perceivable form, but which lack the tangible aspect of paper, papyrus or stone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While not all technologies listed are technically “electronic” in nature (e.g., optical fiber technology), the term “electronic” is the most descriptive term available to describe the majority of current technologies. For example, the development of biological
                            and chemical processes for communication and storage of data, while not specifically mentioned in the definition, are included within the technical definition because such processes operate on electromagnetic impulses. However,
                            whether a particular technology may be characterized as technically “electronic,” i.e., operates on electromagnetic impulses, should not be determinative of whether records and signatures created, used and stored by means of
                            a particular technology are covered by this Act. This Act is intended to apply to all records and signatures created, used and stored by any medium which permits the information to be retrieved in perceivable form.

                            This definition establishes that an electronic agent is a machine. As the term “electronic agent” has come to be recognized, it is limited to a tool function. The effect on the party using the agent is addressed in the operative provisions of the Act
                            (e.g., Section 14 [§ 59.1-492]).

                        <p>
                            An electronic agent, such as a computer program or other automated means employed by a person, is a tool of that person. As a general rule, the employer of a tool is responsible for the results obtained by the use of that tool since the tool has no independent
                            volition of its own. However, an electronic agent, by definition, is capable within the parameters of its programming, of initiating, responding or interacting with other parties or their electronic agents once it has been
                            activated by a party, without further attention of that party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While this Act proceeds on the paradigm that an electronic agent is capable of performing only within the technical strictures of its preset programming, it is conceivable that, within the useful life of this Act, electronic agents may be created with
                            the ability to act autonomously, and not just automatically. That is, through developments in artificial intelligence, a computer may be able to “learn through experience, modify the instructions in their own programs, and
                            even devise new instructions.” Allen and Widdison, “Can Computers Make Contracts?” 9 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech 25 (Winter, 1996). If such developments occur, courts may construe the definition of electronic agent accordingly, in
                            order to recognize such new capabilities.

                            The examples involving Bookseller.com and Automaker in the Comment to the definition of Automated Transaction are equally applicable here. Bookseller acts through an electronic agent in processing an order for books. Automaker and the supplier each act
                            through electronic agents in facilitating and effectuating the just-in-time inventory process through EDI.

                            An electronic record is a subset of the broader defined term “record.” It is any record created, used or stored in a medium other than paper (see definition of electronic). The defined term is also used in this Act as a limiting definition in those provisions

         “Electronic signature.”
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The idea of a signature is broad and not specifically defined. Whether any particular record is “signed” is a question of fact. Proof of that fact must be made under other applicable law. This Act simply assures that the signature may be accomplished
                            through electronic means. No specific technology need be used in order to create a valid signature. One’s voice on an answering machine may suffice if the requisite intention is present. Similarly, including one’s name as part
                            of an electronic mail communication also may suffice, as may the firm name on a facsimile. It also may be shown that the requisite intent was not present and accordingly the symbol, sound or process did not amount to a signature.
                            One may use a digital signature with the requisite intention, or one may use the private key solely as an access device with no intention to sign, or otherwise accomplish a legally binding act. In any case the critical element
                            is the intention to execute or adopt the sound or symbol or process for the purpose of signing the related record.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The definition requires that the signer execute or adopt the sound, symbol, or process with the intent to sign the record. The act of applying a sound, symbol or process to an electronic record could have differing meanings and effects. The consequence
                            of the act and the effect of the act as a signature are determined under other applicable law. However, the essential attribute of a signature involves applying a sound, symbol or process with an intent to do a legally significant
                            act. It is that intention that is understood in the law as a part of the word “sign”, without the need for a definition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Act establishes, to the greatest extent possible, the equivalency of electronic signatures and manual signatures. Therefore the term “signature” has been used to connote and convey that equivalency. The purpose is to overcome unwarranted biases against
                            electronic methods of signing and authenticating records. The term “authentication,” used in other laws, often has a narrower meaning and purpose than an electronic signature as used in this Act. However, an authentication
                            under any of those other laws constitutes an electronic signature under this Act.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The precise effect of an electronic signature will be determined based on the surrounding circumstances under Section 9(b) [§ 59.1-487(b)].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This definition includes as an electronic signature the standard webpage click through process. For example, when a person orders goods or services through a vendor’s website, the person will be required to provide information as part of a process which
                            will result in receipt of the goods or services. When the customer ultimately gets to the last step and clicks “I agree,” the person has adopted the process and has done so with the intent to associate the person with the record
                            of that process. The actual effect of the electronic signature will be determined from all the surrounding circumstances, however, the person adopted a process which the circumstances indicate s/he intended to have the effect
                            of getting the goods/services and being bound to pay for them. The adoption of the process carried the intent to do a legally significant act, the hallmark of a signature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another important aspect of this definition lies in the necessity that the electronic signature be linked or logically associated with the record. In the paper world, it is assumed that the symbol adopted by a party is attached to or located somewhere
                            in the same paper that is intended to be authenticated, e.g., an allonge firmly attached to a promissory note, or the classic signature at the end of a long contract. These tangible manifestations do not exist in the electronic
                            environment, and accordingly, this definition expressly provides that the symbol must in some way be linked to, or connected with, the electronic record being signed. This linkage is consistent with the regulations promulgated
                            by the Food and Drug Administration. 21 CFR Part 11 (March 20, 1997).

                            A digital signature using public key encryption technology would qualify as an electronic signature, as would the mere inclusion of one’s name as a part of an e-mail message — so long as in each case the signer executed or adopted the symbol with the
                            intent to sign.

                            A security procedure may be applied to verify an electronic signature, verify the identity of the sender, or assure the informational integrity of an electronic record. The definition does not identify any particular technology. This permits the use of
                            procedures which the parties select or which are established by law. It permits the greatest flexibility among the parties and allows for future technological development.

                            The definition in this Act is broad and is used to illustrate one way of establishing attribution or content integrity of an electronic record or signature. The use of a security procedure is not accorded operative legal effect, through the use of presumptions
                            or otherwise, by this Act. In this Act, the use of security procedures is simply one method for proving the source or content of an electronic record or signature.

                            A security procedure may be technologically very sophisticated, such as an asymmetric cryptographic system. At the other extreme the security procedure may be as simple as a telephone call to confirm the identity of the sender through another channel
                            of communication. It may include the use of a mother’s maiden name or a personal identification number (PIN). Each of these examples is a method for confirming the identity of a person or accuracy of a message.

                            The definition has been limited to actions between people taken in the context of business, commercial or governmental activities. The term includes all interactions between people for business, commercial, including specifically consumer, or governmental
                            purposes. However, the term does not include unilateral or non-transactional actions. As such it provides a structural limitation on the scope of the Act as stated in the next section.

                            It is essential that the term commerce and business be understood and construed broadly to include commercial and business transactions involving individuals who may qualify as “consumers” under other applicable law. If Alice and Bob agree to the sale
                            of Alice’s car to Bob for $2000 using an internet auction site, that transaction is fully covered by this Act. Even if Alice and Bob each qualify as typical “consumers” under other applicable law, their interaction is a transaction
                            in commerce. Accordingly their actions would be related to commercial affairs, and fully qualify as a transaction governed by this Act.

                            The scope of this Act is inherently limited by the fact that it only applies to transactions related to business, commercial (including consumer) and governmental matters. Consequently, transactions with no relation to business, commercial or governmental
                            transactions would not be subject to this Act. Unilaterally generated electronic records and signatures which are not part of a transaction also are not covered by this Act. See Section 2 [§ 59.1-480], Comment 12.

                            This Act affects the medium in which information, records and signatures may be presented and retained under current legal requirements. While this Act covers all electronic records and signatures which are used in a business, commercial (including consumer)
                            or governmental transaction, the operative provisions of the Act relate to requirements for writings and signatures under other laws. Accordingly, the exclusions in subsection (b) focus on those legal rules imposing certain
                            writing and signature requirements which will not  be affected by this Act.

                            Paragraph (1) excludes wills, codicils and testamentary trusts. This exclusion is largely salutary given the unilateral context in which such records are generally created and the unlikely use of such records in a transaction as defined in this Act (i.e.,
                            actions taken by two or more persons in the context of business, commercial or governmental affairs). Paragraph (2) excludes all of the Uniform Commercial Code other than UCC Sections 1-107 and

                            Articles 3, 4 and 4A of the UCC impact payment systems and have specifically been removed from the coverage of this Act. The check collection and electronic fund transfer systems governed by Articles 3, 4 and 4A involve systems and relationships involving
                            numerous parties beyond the parties to the underlying contract. The impact of validating electronic media in such systems involves considerations beyond the scope of this Act. Articles 5, 8 and 9 have been excluded because
                            the revision process relating to those Articles included significant consideration of electronic practices. Paragraph 4 provides for exclusion from this Act of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) because
                            the drafting process of that Act also included significant consideration of electronic contracting provisions.

                            The very limited application of this Act to Transferable Records in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] does not affect payment systems, and the section is designed to apply to a transaction only through express agreement of the parties. The exclusion of Articles
                            3 and 4 will not affect the Act’s coverage of Transferable Records. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] is designed to allow for the development of systems which will provide “control” as defined in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. Such control
                            is necessary as a substitute for the idea of possession which undergirds negotiable instrument law. The technology has yet to be developed which will allow for the possession of a unique electronic token embodying the rights
                            associated with a negotiable promissory note. Section 16’s [§ 59.1-494’s] concept of control is intended as a substitute for possession.

                            This Act does apply, in toto, to transactions under unrevised Articles 2 and 2A. There is every reason to validate electronic contracting in these situations. Sale and lease transactions do not implicate broad systems beyond the parties to the underlying
                            transaction, such as are present in check collection and electronic funds transfers. Further sales and leases generally do not have as far reaching effect on the rights of third parties beyond the contracting parties, such
                            as exists in the secured transactions system. Finally, it is in the area of sales, licenses and leases that electronic commerce is occurring to its greatest extent today. To exclude these transactions would largely gut the
                            purpose of this Act.

                            An electronic record/signature may be used for purposes of more than one legal requirement, or may be covered by more than one law. Consequently, it is important to make clear, despite any apparent redundancy, in subsection (c) that an electronic record
                            used for purposes of a law which is not   affected by this Act under subsection (b) may nonetheless be used and validated for purposes of other laws not excluded by subsection (b). For example, this Act does not apply to an
                            electronic record of a check when used for purposes of a transaction governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code, i.e., the Act does not validate so-called electronic checks. However, for purposes of check retention
                            statutes, the same electronic record of the check is covered by this Act, so that retention of an electronic image/record of a check will satisfy such retention statutes, so long as the requirements of Section 12 [§ 59.1-490]
                            are fulfilled.

                            Additional exclusions under subparagraph (b)(4) should be limited to laws which govern electronic records and signatures which may be used in transactions as defined in Section 2(16) [§ 59.1-480(16)]. Records used unilaterally, or which do not relate
                            to business, commercial (including consumer), or governmental affairs are not governed by this Act in any event, and exclusion of laws relating to such records may create unintended inferences about whether other records and
                            signatures are covered by this Act.

                        The provisions in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] operate as free standing rules, establishing the rights of parties using Transferable Records under this Act . The references in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] to UCC Sections 3-302, 7-501, and 9-308 (R9-330(d)) are
                        designed to incorporate the substance of those provisions into this Act for the limited purposes noted in Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)]. Accordingly, an electronic record which is also a Transferable Record, would not be used for
                        purposes of a transaction governed by Articles 3, 4, or 9, but would be an electronic record used for purposes of a transaction governed by Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. However, it is important to remember that those UCC Articles will
                        still apply to the transferable record in their own right. Accordingly, any other substantive requirements, e.g., method and manner of perfection under Article 9, must be complied with under those other laws. See Comments to Section
                        16 [§ 59.1-494].

                        In another context, subsection (c) would operate to allow this Act to apply to what would appear to be an excluded transaction under subsection (b). For example, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies generally to any transaction that creates
                        a security interest in personal property. However, Article 9 excludes landlord’s liens. Accordingly, although this Act excludes from its application transactions subject to Article 9, this Act would apply to the creation of a landlord
                        lien if the law otherwise applicable to landlord’s liens did not provide otherwise, because the landlord’s lien transaction is excluded from Article 9.

                    <p>
                        It is also important that additional exclusions, if any, be incorporated under subsection (b)(4). As noted in Comment 8 above, an electronic record used in a transaction excluded under subsection (b), e.g., a check used to pay one’s taxes, will nonetheless
                        be validated for purposes of other, non-excluded laws under subsection (c), e.g., the check when used as proof of payment. It is critical that additional exclusions, if any, be incorporated into subsection (b) so that the salutary
                        effect of subsection (c) apply to validate those records in other, non-excluded transactions. While a legislature may determine that a particular notice, such as a utility shutoff notice, be provided to a person in writing on paper,
                        it is difficult to see why the utility should not be entitled to use electronic media for storage and evidentiary purposes.

                        The following discussion is derived from the Report dated September 21, 1998 of The Task Force on State Law Exclusions (the “Task Force”) presented to the Drafting Committee. After consideration of the Report, the Drafting Committee determined that exclusions
                        other than those specified in the Act were not warranted. In addition, other inherent limitations on the applicability of the Act (the definition of transaction, the requirement that the parties acquiesce in the use of an electronic
                        format) also militate against additional exclusions. Nonetheless, the Drafting Committee recognized that some legislatures may wish to exclude additional transactions from the Act, and determined that guidance in some major areas
                        would be helpful to those legislatures considering additional areas for exclusion.

                        Because of the overwhelming number of references in state law to writings and signatures, the following list of possible transactions is not exhaustive. However, they do represent those areas most commonly raised during the course of the drafting process
                        as areas that might be inappropriate for an electronic medium. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the Drafting Committee determined that exclusion of these additional areas was not warranted.

        Trusts
       </b> (other than testamentary trusts). Trusts can be used for both business and personal purposes. By virtue of the definition of transaction, trusts used outside the area of business and commerce would not be governed by
                        this Act. With respect to business or commercial trusts, the laws governing their formation contain few or no requirements for paper or signatures. Indeed, in most jurisdictions trusts of any kind may be created orally. Consequently,
                        the Drafting Committee believed that the Act should apply to any transaction where the law leaves to the parties the decision of whether to use a writing. Thus, in the absence of legal requirements for writings, there is no sound
                        reason to exclude laws governing trusts from the application of this Act.

        Powers of Attorney.

                        Special health powers of attorney have been established by statute in some States. These powers may have special requirements under state law regarding execution, acknowledgment and possibly notarization. In the normal case such powers will not arise
                        in a transactional context and so would not be covered by this Act. However, even if such a record were to arise in a transactional context, this Act operates simply to remove the barrier to the use of an electronic medium, and
                        preserves other requirements of applicable substantive law, avoiding any necessity to exclude such laws from the operation of this Act. Especially in light of the provisions of Sections 8 and 11 [§§ 59.1-486 and 59.1-489], the
                        substantive requirements under such laws will be preserved and may be satisfied in an electronic format.

        Real Estate Transactions.
       </b> It is important to distinguish between the efficacy of paper documents involving real estate between the parties, as opposed to their effect on third parties. As between the parties it is unnecessary to maintain existing
                        barriers to electronic contracting. There are no unique characteristics to contracts relating to real property as opposed to other business and commercial (including consumer) contracts. Consequently, the decision whether to use
                        an electronic medium for their agreements should be a matter for the parties to determine. Of course, to be effective against third parties state law generally requires filing with a governmental office. Pending adoption of electronic
                        filing systems by States, the need for a piece of paper to file to perfect rights against third parties, will be a consideration for the parties. In the event notarization and acknowledgment are required under other laws, Section
                        11 [§ 59.1-489] provides a means for such actions to be accomplished electronically.

                        With respect to the requirements of government filing, those are left to the individual States in the decision of whether to adopt and implement electronic filing systems. (See optional Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497].) However, government recording
                        systems currently require paper deeds including notarized, manual signatures. Although California and Illinois are experimenting with electronic filing systems, until such systems become widespread, the parties likely will choose
                        to use, at the least, a paper deed for filing purposes. Nothing in this Act precludes the parties from selecting the medium best suited to the needs of the particular transaction. Parties may wish to consummate the transaction
                        using electronic media in order to avoid expensive travel. Yet the actual deed may be in paper form to assure compliance with existing recording systems and requirements. The critical point is that nothing in this Act prevents
                        the parties from selecting paper or electronic media for all or part of their transaction.

        Consumer Protection Statutes.
       </b> Consumer protection provisions in state law often require that information be disclosed or provided to a consumer in writing. Because this Act does apply to such transactions, the question of whether such laws should
                        be specifically excluded was considered. Exclusion of consumer transactions would eliminate a huge group of commercial transactions which benefit consumers by enabling the efficiency of the electronic medium. Commerce over the
                        internet is driven by consumer demands and concerns and must be included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, it is important to recognize the protective effects of many consumer statutes. Consumer statutes often require that information be provided in writing, or may require that the consumer separately sign or initial a particular provision
                        to evidence that the consumer’s attention was brought to the provision. Subsection (1) requires electronic records to be retainable by a person whenever the law requires information to be delivered in writing. The section imposes
                        a significant burden on the sender of information. The sender must assure that the information system of the recipient is compatible with, and capable of retaining the information sent by, the sender’s system. Furthermore, nothing
                        in this Act permits the avoidance of legal requirements of separate signatures or initialing. The Act simply permits the signature or initialing to be done electronically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other consumer protection statutes require (expressly or implicitly) that certain information be presented in a certain manner or format. Laws requiring information to be presented in particular fonts, formats or in similar fashion, as well as laws requiring
                        conspicuous displays of information are preserved. Section 8(b)(3) [§ 59.1-487(b)(3)] specifically preserves the applicability of such requirements in an electronic environment. In the case of legal requirements that information
                        be presented or appear conspicuous, the determination of what is conspicuous will be left to other law. Section 8 [§ 59.1-487] was included to specifically preserve the protective functions of such disclosure statutes, while at
                        the same time allowing the use of electronic media if the substantive requirements of the other laws could be satisfied in the electronic medium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Formatting and separate signing requirements serve a critical purpose in much consumer protection legislation, to assure that information is not slipped past the unsuspecting consumer. Not only does this Act not disturb those requirements, it preserves
                        those requirements. In addition, other bodies of substantive law continue to operate to allow the courts to police any such bad conduct or overreaching, e.g., unconscionability, fraud, duress, mistake and the like. These bodies
                        of law remain applicable regardless of the medium in which a record appears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that both parties agree to conduct a transaction electronically also prevents the imposition of an electronic medium on unwilling parties. See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)]. In addition, where the law requires inclusion of specific terms
                        or language, those requirements are preserved broadly by Section 5(e) [§ 59.1-483(e)].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requirements that information be sent to, or received by, someone have been preserved in Section 15. As in the paper world, obligations to send do not impose any duties on the sender to assure receipt, other than reasonable methods of dispatch. In those
                        cases where receipt is required legally, Sections 5, 8, and 15 [§§ 59.1-483, 59.1-487, and 59.1-493] impose the burden on the sender to assure delivery to the recipient if satisfaction of the legal requirement is to be fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The preservation of existing safeguards, together with the ability to opt out of the electronic medium entirely, demonstrate the lack of any need generally to exclude consumer protection laws from the operation of this Act. Legislatures may wish to focus
                        any review on those statutes which provide for post-contract formation and post-breach notices to be in [on] paper. However, any such consideration must also balance the needed protections against the potential burdens which may
                        be imposed. Consumers and others will not be well served by restrictions which preclude the employment of electronic technologies sought and desired by consumers.

                        This section limits the applicability of this Act to transactions which parties have agreed to conduct electronically. Broad interpretation of the term agreement is necessary to assure that this Act has the widest possible application consistent with
                        its purpose of removing barriers to electronic commerce.

                            This section makes clear that this Act is intended to facilitate the use of electronic means, but does not require the use of electronic records and signatures. This fundamental principle is set forth in subsection (a) and elaborated by subsections (b)
                            and (c), which require an intention to conduct transactions electronically and preserve the right of a party to refuse to use electronics in any subsequent transaction.

                            The paradigm of this Act is two willing parties doing transactions electronically. It is therefore appropriate that the Act is voluntary and preserves the greatest possible party autonomy to refuse electronic transactions. The requirement that party agreement
                            be found from all the surrounding circumstances is a limitation on the scope of this Act.

                            If this Act is to serve to facilitate electronic transactions, it must be applicable under circumstances not rising to a full fledged contract to use electronics. While absolute certainty can be accomplished by obtaining an explicit contract before relying
                            on electronic transactions, such an explicit contract should not be necessary before one may feel safe in conducting transactions electronically. Indeed, such a requirement would itself be an unreasonable barrier to electronic
                            commerce, at odds with the fundamental purpose of this Act. Accordingly, the requisite agreement, express or implied, must be determined from all available circumstances and evidence.

                            Subsection (b) provides that the Act applies to transactions in which the parties have agreed to conduct the transaction electronically. In this context it is essential that the parties’ actions and words be broadly construed in determining whether the
                            requisite agreement exists. Accordingly, the Act expressly provides that the party’s agreement is to be found from all circumstances, including the parties’ conduct. The critical element is the intent of a party to conduct
                            a transaction electronically. Once that intent is established, this Act applies. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Sections 2, 3, and 19.

                            to conduct that transaction and to receive any correspondence related to the transaction electronically can be inferred from the conduct. Accordingly, as to information related to that transaction it is reasonable for Bookseller

                            A party’s right to decline to act electronically under a specific contract, on the ground that each action under that contract amounts to a separate “transaction,” must be considered in light of the purpose of the contract and the action to be taken electronically.
                            For example, under a contract for the purchase of goods, the giving and receipt of notices electronically, as provided in the contract, should not be viewed as discreet transactions. Rather such notices amount to separate actions
                            which are part of the “transaction” of purchase evidenced by the contract. Allowing one party to require a change of medium in the middle of the transaction evidenced by that contract is not the purpose of this subsection.
                            Rather this subsection is intended to preserve the party’s right to conduct the next purchase in a non-electronic medium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7. Subsection (e) is an essential provision in the overall scheme of this Act. While this Act validates and effectuates electronic records and electronic signatures, the legal effect of such records and signatures is left to existing substantive law outside
                            this Act except in very narrow circumstances. See, e.g., Section 16 [§ 59.1-494]. Even when this Act operates to validate records and signatures in an electronic medium, it expressly preserves the substantive rules of other
                            law applicable to such records. See, e.g., Section 11 [§ 59.1-489].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, beyond validation of records, signatures and contracts based on the medium used, Section 7 [§ 59.1-485] (a) and (b) should not be interpreted as establishing the legal effectiveness of any given record, signature or contract. Where a rule
                            of law requires that the record contain minimum substantive content, the legal effect of such a record will depend on whether the record meets the substantive requirements of other applicable law.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Section 8 [§ 59.1-486] expressly preserves a number of legal requirements in currently existing law relating to the presentation of information in writing. Although this Act now would allow such information to be presented in an electronic record, Section
                            8 [§ 59.1-486] provides that the other substantive requirements of law must be satisfied in the electronic medium as well.

                            This section sets forth the fundamental premise of this Act: namely, that the medium in which a record, signature, or contract is created, presented or retained does not affect its legal significance. Subsections (a) and (b) are designed to eliminate
                            the single element of medium as a reason to deny effect or enforceability to a record, signature, or contract. The fact that the information is set forth in an electronic, as opposed to paper, record is irrelevant.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c42.1s59.1-485-officialcomment.1ol12">
                            Under Restatement 2d Contracts Section 8, a contract may have legal effect and yet be unenforceable. Indeed, one circumstance where a record or contract may have effect but be unenforceable is in the context of the Statute of Frauds. Though a contract
                            may be unenforceable, the records may have collateral effects, as in the case of a buyer that insures goods purchased under a contract unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. The insurance company may not deny a claim on
                            the ground that the buyer is not the owner, though the buyer may have no direct remedy against the seller for failure to deliver. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Section 8, Illustration 4.

                    <p>
                        While this section would validate an electronic record for purposes of a statute of frauds, if an agreement to conduct the transaction electronically cannot reasonably be found (See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)]) then a necessary predicate to the applicability
                        of this Act would be absent and this Act would not validate the electronic record. Whether the electronic record might be valid under other law is not addressed by this Act.

                            3. Subsections (c) and (d) provide the positive assertion that electronic records and signatures satisfy legal requirements for writings and signatures. The provisions are limited to requirements in laws that a record be in writing or be signed. This
                            section does not address requirements imposed by other law in addition to requirements for writings and signatures. See, e.g., Section 8 [§ 59.1-486].
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Subsections (c) and (d) are particularized applications of subsection (a). The purpose is to validate and effectuate electronic records and signatures as the equivalent of writings, subject to all of the rules applicable to the efficacy of a writing,
                            except as such other rules are modified by the more specific provisions of this Act.

         Illustration 1:
        </b> A sends the following e-mail to B: “I hereby offer to buy widgets from you, delivery next Tuesday. /s/ A.” B responds with the following e-mail: “I accept your offer to buy widgets for delivery next Tuesday. /s/
                            B.” The e-mails may not be denied effect solely because they are electronic. In addition, the e-mails do qualify as records under the Statute of Frauds. However, because there is no quantity stated in either record, the parties’
                            agreement would be unenforceable under existing UCC Section 2-201(1).
                        </p>

                            next Tuesday. /s/ B.” In this case the analysis is the same as in Illustration 1 except that here the records otherwise satisfy the requirements of UCC Section 2-201(1). The transaction may not be denied legal effect solely
                            because there is not a pen and ink “writing” or “signature”.

                            4. Section 8 [§ 59.1-486] addresses additional requirements imposed by other law which may affect the legal effect or enforceability of an electronic record in a particular case. For example, in Section 8(a) [§ 59.1-486(a)] the legal requirement addressed
                            is the provision of information in writing. The section then sets forth the standards to be applied in determining whether the provision of information by an electronic record is the equivalent of the provision of information
                            in writing. The requirements in Section 8 [§ 59.1-486] are in addition to the bare validation that occurs under this section.

                            5. Under the substantive law applicable to a particular transaction within this Act, the legal effect of an electronic record may be separate from the issue of whether the record contains a signature. For example, where notice must be given as part of
                            a contractual obligation, the effectiveness of the notice will turn on whether the party provided the notice regardless of whether the notice was signed (See Section 15 [§ 59.1-493]). An electronic record attributed to a party
                            under Section 9 [§ 59.1-487] and complying with the requirements of Section 15 [§ 59.1-493] would suffice in that case, notwithstanding that it may not contain an electronic signature.

                            This section is a savings provision, designed to assure, consistent with the fundamental purpose of this Act, that otherwise applicable substantive law will not be overridden by this Act. The section makes clear that while the pen and ink provisions of

                            This section is independent of the prior section. Section 7 [§ 59.1-485] refers to legal requirements for a writing. This section refers to legal requirements for the provision of information in writing or relating to the method or manner of presentation
                            or delivery of information. The section addresses more specific legal requirements of other laws, provides standards for satisfying the more particular legal requirements, and defers to other law for satisfaction of requirements

                            Under subsection (a), to meet a requirement of other law that information be provided in writing, the recipient of an electronic record of the information must be able to get to the electronic record and read it, and must have the ability to get back
                            to the information in some way at a later date. Accordingly, the section requires that the electronic record be capable of retention for later review.

                            Subsection (b) is a savings provision for laws which provide for the means of delivering or displaying information and which are not affected by the Act. For example, if a law requires delivery of notice by first class US mail, that means of delivery
                            would not be affected by this Act. The information to be delivered may be provided on a disc, i.e., in electronic form, but the particular means of delivery must still be via the US postal service. Display, delivery and formatting
                            requirements will continue to be applicable to electronic records and signatures. If those legal requirements can be satisfied in an electronic medium, e.g., the information can be presented in the equivalent of 20 point bold
                            type as required by other law, this Act will validate the use of the medium, leaving to the other applicable law the question of whether the particular electronic record meets the other legal requirements. If a law requires
                            that particular records be delivered together, or attached to other records, this Act does not preclude the delivery of the records together in an electronic communication, so long as the records are connected or associated
                            with each other in a way determined to satisfy the other law.

                            Subsection (c) provides incentives for senders of information to use systems which will not inhibit the other party from retaining the information. However, there are circumstances where a party providing certain information may wish to inhibit retention
                            in order to protect intellectual property rights or prevent the other party from retaining confidential information about the sender. In such cases inhibition is understandable, but if the sender wishes to enforce the record
                            in which the information is contained, the sender may not inhibit its retention by the recipient. Unlike subsection (a), subsection (c) applies in all transactions and simply provides for unenforceability against the recipient.
                            Subsection (a) applies only where another law imposes the writing requirement, and subsection (a) imposes a broader responsibility on the sender to assure retention capability by the recipient.

                        The section specifically provides that any inhibition on retention imposed by the sender or the sender’s system will preclude satisfaction of this section. Use of technological means now existing or later developed which prevents the recipient from retaining
                        a copy of the information would result in a determination that information has not been provided under subsection (a). The policies underlying laws requiring the provision of information in writing warrant the imposition of an
                        additional burden on the sender to make the information available in a manner which will permit subsequent reference. A difficulty does exist for senders of information because of the disparate systems of their recipients and the
                        capabilities of those systems. However, in order to satisfy the legal requirement of other law to make information available, the sender must assure that the recipient receives and can retain the information. However, it is left
                        for the courts to determine whether the sender has complied with this subsection if evidence demonstrates that it is something peculiar to the recipient’s system which precludes subsequent reference to the information.

                            6. The protective purposes of this section justify the non-waivability provided by subsection (d). However, since the requirements for sending and formatting and the like are imposed by other law, to the extent other law permits waiver of such protections,
                            there is no justification for imposing a more severe burden in an electronic environment.

                            rules of law regarding attribution. The section assures that such rules will be applied in the electronic environment. A person’s actions include actions taken by human agents of the person, as well as actions taken by an electronic
                            agent, i.e., the tool, of the person. Although the rule may appear to state the obvious, it assures that the record or signature is not ascribed to a machine, as opposed to the person operating or programing the machine.

                        In each of the following cases, both the electronic record and electronic signature would be attributable to a person under subsection (a):

                    <p>
                        In each of the above cases, law other than this Act would ascribe both the signature and the action to the person if done in a paper medium. Subsection (a) expressly provides that the same result will occur when an electronic medium is used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Nothing in this section affects the use of a signature as a device for attributing a record to a person. Indeed, a signature is often the primary method for attributing a record to a person. In the foregoing examples, once the electronic signature
                        is attributed to the person, the electronic record would also be attributed to the person, unless the person established fraud, forgery, or other invalidating cause. However, a signature is not the only method for attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. The use of facsimile transmissions provides a number of examples of attribution using information other than a signature. A facsimile may be attributed to a person because of the information printed across the top of the page that indicates the machine
                        from which it was sent. Similarly, the transmission may contain a letterhead which identifies the sender. Some cases have held that the letterhead actually constituted a signature because it was a symbol adopted by the sender with
                        intent to authenticate the facsimile. However, the signature determination resulted from the necessary finding of intention in that case. Other cases have found facsimile letterheads NOT to be signatures because the requisite intention
                        was not present. The critical point is that with or without a signature, information within the electronic record may well suffice to provide the facts resulting in attribution of an electronic record to a particular party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the context of attribution of records, normally the content of the record will provide the necessary information for a finding of attribution. It is also possible that an established course of dealing between parties may result in a finding of attribution.
                        Just as with a paper record, evidence of forgery or counterfeiting may be introduced to rebut the evidence of attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. Certain information may be present in an electronic environment that does not appear to attribute but which clearly links a person to a particular record. Numerical codes, personal identification numbers, public and private key combinations all serve
                        to establish the party to whom an electronic record should be attributed. Of course, security procedures will be another piece of evidence available to establish attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inclusion of a specific reference to security procedures as a means of proving attribution is salutary because of the unique importance of security procedures in the electronic environment. In certain processes, a technical and technological security
                        procedure may be the best way to convince a trier of fact that a particular electronic record or signature was that of a particular person. In certain circumstances, the use of a security procedure to establish that the record
                        and related signature came from the person’s business might be necessary to overcome a claim that a hacker intervened. The reference to security procedures is not intended to suggest that other forms of proof of attribution should
                        be accorded less persuasive effect. It is also important to recall that the particular strength of a given procedure does not affect the procedure’s status as a security procedure, but only affects the weight to be accorded the
                        evidence of the security procedure as tending to establish attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. This section does apply in determining the effect of a “click-through” transaction. A “click-through” transaction involves a process which, if executed with an intent to “sign,” will be an electronic signature. See definition of Electronic Signature.
                        In the context of an anonymous “click-through,” issues of proof will be paramount. This section will be relevant to establish that the resulting electronic record is attributable to a particular person upon the requisite proof,
                        including security procedures which may track the source of the click-through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. Once it is established that a record or signature is attributable to a particular party, the effect of a record or signature must be determined in light of the context and surrounding circumstances, including the parties’ agreement, if any. Also informing
                        the effect of any attribution will be other legal requirements considered in light of the context. Subsection (b) addresses the effect of the record or signature once attributed to a person.

                            This section is limited to changes and errors occurring in transmissions between parties — whether person to person (paragraph 1) or in an automated transaction involving an individual and a machine (paragraphs 1 and 2). The section focuses on the effect
                            of changes and errors occurring when records are exchanged between parties. In cases where changes and errors occur in contexts other than transmission, the law of mistake is expressly made applicable to resolve the conflict.

                            Paragraph (1) deals with any transmission where the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes and errors. It operates against the non-conforming party, i.e., the party in the best position to have avoided the change or error, regardless
                            of whether that person is the sender or recipient. The source of the error/change is not indicated, and so both human and machine errors/changes would be covered. With respect to errors or changes that would not be detected
                            by the security procedure even if applied, the parties are left to the general law of mistake to resolve the dispute.

                            Paragraph (1) applies only in the situation where a security procedure would detect the error/change but one party fails to use the procedure and does not detect the error/change. In such a case, consistent with the law of mistake generally, the record
                            is made avoidable at the instance of the party who took all available steps to avoid the mistake. See Restatement 2d Contracts, Sections 152-154.

                            As with paragraph (1), paragraph (2), when applicable, allows the mistaken party to avoid the effect of the erroneous electronic record. However, the subsection is limited to human error on the part of an individual when dealing with the electronic agent
                            of the other party. In a transaction between individuals there is a greater ability to correct the error before parties have acted on it. However, when an individual makes an error while dealing with the electronic agent of
                            the other party, it may not be possible to correct the error before the other party has shipped or taken other action in reliance on the erroneous record.

                            The party acting through the electronic agent/machine is given incentives by this section to build in safeguards which enable the individual to prevent the sending of an erroneous record, or correct the error once sent. For example, the electronic agent
                            may be programed to provide a “confirmation screen” to the individual setting forth all the information the individual initially approved. This would provide the individual with the ability to prevent the erroneous record from
                            ever being sent. Similarly, the electronic agent might receive the record sent by the individual and then send back a confirmation which the individual must again accept before the transaction is completed. This would allow
                            for correction of an erroneous record. In either case, the electronic agent would “provide an opportunity for prevention or correction of the error,” and the subsection would not apply. Rather, the effect of any error is governed
                            by other law.

                            Paragraph (2) also places additional requirements on the mistaken individual before the paragraph may be invoked to avoid an erroneous electronic record. The individual must take prompt action to advise the other party of the error and the fact that the
                            individual did not intend the electronic record. Whether the action is prompt must be determined from all the circumstances including the individual’s ability to contact the other party. The individual should advise the other
                            party both of the error and of the lack of intention to be bound (i.e., avoidance) by the electronic record received. Since this provision allows avoidance by the mistaken party, that party should also be required to expressly
                            note that it is seeking to avoid the electronic record, i.e., lacked the intention to be bound.

                    <p>
                        The section covers both changes and errors. For example, if Buyer sends a message to Seller ordering 100 widgets, but Buyer’s information processing system changes the order to 1000 widgets, a “change” has occurred between what Buyer transmitted and what
                        Seller received. If on the other hand, Buyer typed in 1000 intending to order only 100, but sent the message before noting the mistake, an error would have occurred which would also be covered by this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making the erroneous record avoidable by the conforming party is consistent with Sections 153 and 154 of the Restatement 2d Contracts because the non-conforming party was in the best position to avoid the problem, and would bear the risk of mistake. Such
                        a case would constitute mistake by one party. The mistaken party (the conforming party) would be entitled to avoid any resulting contract under Section 153 because s/he does not have the risk of mistake and the non-conforming party
                        had reason to know of the mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paragraph (2) applies only to errors made by individuals. If the error results from the electronic agent, it would constitute a system error. In such a case the effect of that error would be resolved under paragraph (1) if applicable, otherwise under
                        paragraph (3) and the general law of mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, restitution is normally required in order to undo a mistaken transaction. Accordingly, the individual must also return or destroy any consideration received, adhering to instructions from the other party in any case. This is to assure that the
                        other party retains control over the consideration sent in error.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, and most importantly in regard to transactions involving intermediaries which may be harmed because transactions cannot be unwound, the individual cannot have received any benefit from the transaction. This section prevents a party from unwinding
                        a transaction after the delivery of value and consideration which cannot be returned or destroyed. For example, if the consideration received is information, it may not be possible to avoid the benefit conferred. While the information
                        itself could be returned, mere access to the information, or the ability to redistribute the information, would constitute a benefit precluding the mistaken party from unwinding the transaction. It may also occur that the mistaken
                        party receives consideration which changes in value between the time of receipt and the first opportunity to return. In such a case restitution cannot be made adequately, and the transaction would not be avoidable. In each of the
                        foregoing cases, under subparagraph (2)(c), the individual would have received the benefit of the consideration and would NOT be able to avoid the erroneous electronic record under this section.

                            7. In all cases not covered by paragraphs (1) or (2), where error or change to a record occur, the parties’ contract, or other law, specifically including the law of mistake, applies to resolve any dispute. In the event that the parties’ contract and
                            other law would achieve different results, the construction of the parties’ contract is left to the other law. If the error occurs in the context of record retention, Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] will apply. In that case the standard
                            is one of accuracy and retrievability of the information.

                            8. Paragraph (4) makes the error correction provision in paragraph (2) and the application of the law of mistake in paragraph (3) non-variable. Paragraph (2) provides incentives for parties using electronic agents to establish safeguards for individuals
                            dealing with them. It also avoids unjustified windfalls to the individual by erecting stringent requirements before the individual may exercise the right of avoidance under the paragraph. Therefore, there is no reason to permit
                            parties to avoid the paragraph by agreement. Rather, parties should satisfy the paragraph’s requirements.

                        This section permits a notary public and other authorized officers to act electronically, effectively removing the stamp/seal requirements. However, the section does not eliminate any of the other requirements of notarial laws, and consistent with the
                        entire thrust of this Act, simply allows the signing and information to be accomplished in an electronic medium.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, Buyer wishes to send a notarized Real Estate Purchase Agreement to Seller via e-mail. The notary must appear in the room with the Buyer, satisfy him/herself as to the identity of the Buyer, and swear to that identification. All that activity
                        must be reflected as part of the electronic Purchase Agreement and the notary’s electronic signature must appear as a part of the electronic real estate purchase contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As another example, Buyer seeks to send Seller an affidavit averring defects in the products received. A court clerk, authorized under state law to administer oaths, is present with Buyer in a room. The Clerk administers the oath and includes the statement
                        of the oath, together with any other requisite information, in the electronic record to be sent to the Seller. Upon administering the oath and witnessing the application of Buyer’s electronic signature to the electronic record,
                        the Clerk also applies his electronic signature to the electronic record. So long as all substantive requirements of other applicable law have been fulfilled and are reflected in the electronic record, the sworn electronic record
                        of Buyer is as effective as if it had been transcribed on paper.

                            This section deals with the serviceability of electronic records as retained records and originals. So long as there exists reliable assurance that the electronic record accurately reproduces the information, this section continues the theme of establishing
                            the functional equivalence of electronic and paper-based records. This is consistent with Fed.R.Evid. 1001(3) and Unif.R.Evid. 1001(3) (1974). This section assures that information stored electronically will remain effective
                            for all audit, evidentiary, archival and similar purposes.

                            In an electronic medium, the concept of an original document is problematic. For example, as one drafts a document on a computer the “original” is either on a disc or the hard drive to which the document has been initially saved. If one periodically saves
                            the draft, the fact is that at times a document may be first saved to disc then to hard drive, and at others vice versa. In such a case the “original” may change from the information on the disc to the information on the hard
                            drive. Indeed, it may be argued that the “original” exists solely in RAM and, in a sense, the original is destroyed when a “copy” is saved to a disc or to the hard drive. In any event, in the context of record retention, the
                            concern focuses on the integrity of the information, and not with its “originality.”

                            Subsection (a) requires accuracy and the ability to access at a later time. The requirement of accuracy is derived from the Uniform and Federal Rules of Evidence. The requirement of continuing accessibility addresses the issue of technology obsolescence
                            and the need to update and migrate information to developing systems. It is not unlikely that within the span of 5-10 years (a period during which retention of much information is required) a corporation may evolve through
                            one or more generations of technology. More to the point, these technologies may be incompatible with each other necessitating the reconversion of information from one system to the other.

                            Subsections (b) and (c) simply make clear that certain ancillary information or the use of third parties, does not affect the serviceability of records and information retained electronically. Again, the relevance of particular information will not be
                            known until that information is required at a subsequent time.

                            Subsection (d) continues the theme of the Act as validating electronic records as originals where the law requires retention of an original. The validation of electronic records and electronic information as originals is consistent with the Uniform Rules
                            of Evidence. See Uniform Rules of Evidence 1001(3), 1002, 1003 and 1004.

                            Subsection (e) specifically addresses particular concerns regarding check retention statutes in many jurisdictions. A Report compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston identifies hundreds of state laws which require the retention or production of
                            original canceled checks. Such requirements preclude banks and their customers from realizing the benefits and efficiencies related to truncation processes otherwise validated under current law. The benefits to banks and their
                            customers from electronic check retention are effectuated by this provision.

                            Subsections (f) and (g) generally address other record retention statutes. As with check retention, all businesses and individuals may realize significant savings from electronic record retention. So long as the standards in Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] are
                            satisfied, this section permits all parties to obtain those benefits. As always the government may require records in any medium, however, these subsections require a governmental agency to specifically identify the types of
                            records and requirements that will be imposed.

                        For example, certain operating systems from the early 1980’s, e.g., memory typewriters, became obsolete with the development of personal computers. The information originally stored on the memory typewriter would need to be converted to the personal computer
                        system in a way meeting the standards for accuracy contemplated by this section. It is also possible that the medium on which the information is stored is less stable. For example, information stored on floppy discs is generally
                        less stable, and subject to a greater threat of disintegration, than information stored on a computer hard drive. In either case, the continuing accessibility issue must be satisfied to validate information stored by electronic
                        means under this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section permits parties to convert original written records to electronic records for retention so long as the requirements of subsection (a) are satisfied. Accordingly, in the absence of specific requirements to retain written records, written records
                        may be destroyed once saved as electronic records, satisfying the requirements of this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subsection refers to the information contained in an electronic record, rather than relying on the term electronic record, as a matter of clarity that the critical aspect in retention is the information itself. What information must be retained is
                        determined by the purpose for which the information is needed. If the addressing and pathway information regarding an e-mail is relevant, then that information should also be retained. However if it is the substance of the e-mail
                        that is relevant, only that information need be retained. Of course, wise record retention would include all such information since what information will be relevant at a later time will not be known.

                            This section confirms that contracts can be formed by machines functioning as electronic agents for parties to a transaction. It negates any claim that lack of human intent, at the time of contract formation, prevents contract formation. When machines
                            are involved, the requisite intention flows from the programming and use of the machine. As in other cases, these are salutary provisions consistent with the fundamental purpose of the Act to remove barriers to electronic transactions
                            while leaving the substantive law, e.g., law of mistake, law of contract formation, unaffected to the greatest extent possible.

                            The process in paragraph (2) validates an anonymous click-through transaction. It is possible that an anonymous click-through process may simply result in no recognizable legal relationship, e.g., A goes to a person’s website and acquires access without
                            in any way identifying herself, or otherwise indicating agreement or assent to any limitation or obligation, and the owner’s site grants A access. In such a case no legal relationship has been created.

                            In the transaction set forth in Comment 2, the record of the transaction also will include an electronic signature. By clicking “I agree”, A adopted a process with the intent to “sign,” i.e., bind herself to a legal obligation, the resulting record of
                            the transaction. If a “signed writing” were required under otherwise applicable law, this transaction would be enforceable. If a “signed writing” were not required, it may be sufficient to establish that the electronic record
                            is attributable to A under Section 9 [§ 59.1-487]. Attribution may be shown in any manner reasonable including showing that, of necessity, A could only have gotten the information through the process at the website.

                        On the other hand it may be possible that A’s actions indicate agreement to a particular term. For example, A goes to a website and is confronted by an initial screen which advises her that the information at this site is proprietary, that A may use the
                        information for her own personal purposes, but that, by clicking below, A agrees that any other use without the site owner’s permission is prohibited. If A clicks “agree” and downloads the information and then uses the information
                        for other, prohibited purposes, should not A be bound by the click? It seems the answer properly should be, and would be, yes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the owner can show that the only way A could have obtained the information was from his website, and that the process to access the subject information required that A must have clicked the “I agree” button after having the ability to see the conditions
                        on use, A has performed actions which A was free to refuse, which A knew would cause the site to grant her access, i.e., “complete the transaction.” The terms of the resulting contract will be determined under general contract
                        principles, but will include the limitation on A’s use of the information, as a condition precedent to granting her access to the information.

                            This section provides default rules regarding when and from where an electronic record is sent and when and where an electronic record is received. This section does not address the efficacy of the record that is sent or received. That is, whether a record
                            is unintelligible or unusable by a recipient is a separate issue from whether that record was sent or received. The effectiveness of an illegible record, whether it binds any party, are questions left to other law.

                            Subsection (a) furnishes rules for determining when an electronic record is sent. The effect of the sending and its import are determined by other law once it is determined that a sending has occurred.

                            Subsection (b) provides simply that when a record enters the system which the recipient has designated or uses and to which it has access, in a form capable of being processed by that system, it is received. Keying receipt to a system accessible by the
                            recipient removes the potential for a recipient leaving messages with a server or other service in order to avoid receipt. However, the section does not resolve the issue of how the sender proves the time of receipt.

                            Subsections (c) and (d) provide default rules for determining where a record will be considered to have been sent or received. The focus is on the place of business of the recipient and not the physical location of the information processing system, which
                            may bear absolutely no relation to the transaction between the parties. It is not uncommon for users of electronic commerce to communicate from one State to another without knowing the location of information systems through
                            which communication is operated. In addition, the location of certain communication systems may change without either of the parties being aware of the change. Accordingly, where the place of sending or receipt is an issue
                            under other applicable law, e.g., conflict of laws issues, tax issues, the relevant location should be the location of the sender or recipient and not the location of the information processing system.

                            Subsection (e) makes clear that receipt is not dependent on a person having notice that the record is in the person’s system. Receipt occurs when the record reaches the designated system whether or not the recipient ever retrieves the record. The paper
                            analog is the recipient who never reads a mail notice.

                            Subsection (f) provides legal certainty regarding the effect of an electronic acknowledgment. It only addresses the fact of receipt, not the quality of the content, nor whether the electronic record was read or “opened.”

                            Subsection (g) limits the parties’ ability to vary the method for sending and receipt provided in subsections (a) and (b), when there is a legal requirement for the sending or receipt. As in other circumstances where legal requirements derive from other
                            substantive law, to the extent that the other law permits variation by agreement, this Act does not impose any additional requirements, and provisions of this Act may be varied to the extent provided in the other law.

                    <p>
                        In order to have a proper sending, the subsection requires that information be properly addressed or otherwise directed to the recipient. In order to send within the meaning of this section, there must be specific information which will direct the record
                        to the intended recipient. Although mass electronic sending is not precluded, a general broadcast message, sent to systems rather than individuals, would not suffice as a sending.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The record will be considered sent once it leaves the control of the sender, or comes under the control of the recipient. Records sent through e-mail or the internet will pass through many different server systems. Accordingly, the critical element when
                        more than one system is involved is the loss of control by the sender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the structure of many message delivery systems is such that electronic records may actually never leave the control of the sender. For example, within a university or corporate setting, e-mail sent within the system to another faculty member
                        is technically not out of the sender’s control since it never leaves the organization’s server. Accordingly, to qualify as a sending, the e-mail must arrive at a point where the recipient has control. This section does not address
                        the effect of an electronic record that is thereafter “pulled back,” e.g., removed from a mailbox. The analog in the paper world would be removing a letter from a person’s mailbox. As in the case of providing information electronically
                        under Section 8 [§ 59.1-486], the recipient’s ability to receive a message should be judged from the perspective of whether the sender has done any action which would preclude retrieval. This is especially the case in regard to
                        sending, since the sender must direct the record to a system designated or used by the recipient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To assure that the recipient retains control of the place of receipt, subsection (b) requires that the system be specified or used by the recipient, and that the system be used or designated for the type of record being sent. Many people have multiple
                        e-mail addresses for different purposes. Subsection (b) assures that recipients can designate the e-mail address or system to be used in a particular transaction. For example, the recipient retains the ability to designate a home
                        e-mail for personal matters, work e-mail for official business, or a separate organizational e-mail solely for the business purposes of that organization. If A sends B a notice at his home which relates to business, it may not
                        be deemed received if B designated his business address as the sole address for business purposes. Whether actual knowledge upon seeing it at home would qualify as receipt is determined under the otherwise applicable substantive
                        law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (d) assures individual flexibility in designating the place from which a record will be considered sent or at which a record will be considered received. Under subsection (d), a person may designate the place of sending or receipt unilaterally
                        in an electronic record. This ability, as with the ability to designate by agreement, may be limited by otherwise applicable law to places having a reasonable relationship to the transaction.

                            Paper negotiable instruments and documents are unique in the fact that a tangible token — a piece of paper — actually embodies intangible rights and obligations. The extreme difficulty of creating a unique electronic token which embodies the singular
                            attributes of a paper negotiable document or instrument dictates that the rules relating to negotiable documents and instruments not be simply amended to allow the use of an electronic record for the requisite paper writing.
                            However, the desirability of establishing rules by which business parties might be able to acquire some of the benefits of negotiability in an electronic environment is recognized by the inclusion of this section on Transferable
                            Records.

                            The definition of transferable record is limited in two significant ways. First, only the equivalent of paper promissory notes and paper documents of title can be created as transferable records. Notes and Documents of Title do not impact the broad systems
                            that relate to the broader payment mechanisms related, for example, to checks. Impacting the check collection system by allowing for “electronic checks” has ramifications well beyond the ability of this Act to address. Accordingly,
                            this Act excludes from its scope transactions governed by UCC Articles 3 and 4. The limitation to promissory note equivalents in Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] is quite important in that regard because of the ability to deal with
                            many enforcement issues by contract without affecting such systemic concerns.

                            Under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] acquisition of “control” over an electronic record serves as a substitute for “possession” in the paper analog. More precisely, “control” under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] serves as the substitute for delivery, indorsement and
                            possession of a negotiable promissory note or negotiable document of title. Section 16(b) [§ 59.1-494(b)] allows control to be found so long as “a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable
                            record reliably establishes [the person claiming control] as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.” The key point is that a system, whether involving third party registry or technological safeguards,
                            must be shown to reliably establish the identity of the person entitled to payment. Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)] then sets forth a safe harbor list of very strict requirements for such a system. The specific provisions listed
                            in Section 16(c) [§ 59.1-494(c)] are derived from Section 105 of Revised Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Generally, the transferable record must be unique, identifiable, and except as specifically permitted, unalterable.
                            That “authoritative copy” must (i) identify the person claiming control as the person to whom the record was issued or most recently transferred, (ii) be maintained by the person claiming control or its designee, and (iii)
                            be unalterable except with the permission of the person claiming control. In addition any copy of the authoritative copy must be readily identifiable as a copy and all revisions must be readily identifiable as authorized or
                            unauthorized.

                            It is important to note what the section does not provide. Issues related to enforceability against intermediate transferees and transferors (i.e., indorser liability under a paper note), warranty liability that would attach in a paper note, and issues
                            of the effect of taking a transferable record on the underlying obligation, are NOT addressed by this section. Such matters must be addressed, if at all, by contract between and among the parties in the chain of transmission
                            and transfer of the transferable record. In the event that such matters are not addressed by the contract, the issues would need to be resolved under otherwise applicable law. Other law may include general contract principles
                            of assignment and assumption, or may include rules from Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code applied by analogy.

                            Current business models exist which rely for their efficacy on the benefits of negotiability. A principal example, and one which informed much of the development of Section 16 [§ 59.1-494], involves the mortgage backed securities industry. Aggregators
                            of commercial paper acquire mortgage secured promissory notes following a chain of transfers beginning with the origination of the mortgage loan by a mortgage broker. In the course of the transfers of this paper, buyers of
                            the notes and lenders/secured parties for these buyers will intervene. For the ultimate purchaser of the paper, the ability to rely on holder in due course and good faith purchaser status creates the legal security necessary
                            to issue its own investment securities which are backed by the obligations evidenced by the notes purchased. Only through their HIDC status can these purchasers be assured that third party claims will be barred. Only through
                            their HIDC status can the end purchaser avoid the incredible burden of requiring and assuring that each person in the chain of transfer has waived any and all defenses to performance which may be created during the chain of
                            transfer.

                            This section is a stand-alone provision. Although references are made to specific provisions in Article 3, Article 7, and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, these provisions are incorporated into this Act and made the applicable rules for purposes
                            of this Act. The rights of parties to transferable records are established under subsections (d) and (e). Subsection (d) provides rules for determining the rights of a party in control of a transferable record. The subsection
                            makes clear that the rights are determined under this section, and not under other law, by incorporating the rules on the manner of acquisition into this statute. The last sentence of subsection (d) is intended to assure that
                            requirements related to notions of possession, which are inherently inconsistent with the idea of an electronic record, are not incorporated into this statute.

                            Subsection (e) accords to the obligor of the transferable record rights equal to those of an obligor under an equivalent paper record. Accordingly, unless a waiver of defense clause is obtained in the electronic record, or the transferee obtains HDC rights
                            under subsection (d), the obligor has all the rights and defenses available to it under a contract assignment. Additionally, the obligor has the right to have the payment noted or otherwise included as part of the electronic
                            record.

                            Subsection (f) grants the obligor the right to have the transferable record and other information made available for purposes of assuring the correct person to pay. This will allow the obligor to protect its interest and obtain the defense of discharge
                            by payment or performance. This is particularly important because a person receiving subsequent control under the appropriate circumstances may well qualify as a holder in duecourse who can enforce payment of the transferable
                            record.

                        This section provides legal support for the creation, transferability and enforceability of electronic note and document equivalents, as against the issuer/obligor. The certainty created by the section provides the requisite incentive for industry to
                        develop the systems and processes, which involve significant expenditures of time and resources, to enable the use of such electronic documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The importance of facilitating the development of systems which will permit electronic equivalents is a function of cost, efficiency and safety for the records. The storage cost and space needed for the billions of paper notes and documents is phenomenal.
                        Further, natural disasters can wreak havoc on the ability to meet legal requirements for retaining, retrieving and delivering paper instruments. The development of electronic systems meeting the rigorous standards of this section
                        will permit retention of copies which reflect the same integrity as the original. As a result storage, transmission and other costs will be reduced, while security and the ability to satisfy legal requirements governing such paper
                        records will be enhanced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] provides for the creation of an electronic record which may be controlled by the holder, who in turn may obtain the benefits of holder in due course and good faith purchaser status. If the benefits and efficiencies of electronic
                        media are to be realized in this industry it is essential to establish a means by which transactions involving paper promissory notes may be accomplished completely electronically. Particularly as other aspects of such transactions
                        are accomplished electronically, the drag on the transaction of requiring a paper note becomes evident. In addition to alleviating the logistical problems of generating, storing and retrieving paper, the mailing and transmission
                        costs associated with such transactions will also be reduced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, not only is Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] limited to electronic records which would qualify as negotiable promissory notes or documents if they were in writing, but the issuer of the electronic record must expressly agree that the electronic record
                        is to be considered a transferable record. The definition of transferable record as “an electronic record that . . . the issuer of the electronic record expressly has agreed is a transferable record” indicates that the electronic
                        record itself will likely set forth the issuer’s agreement, though it may be argued that a contemporaneous electronic or written record might set forth the issuer’s agreement. However, conversion of a paper note issued as such
                        would not be possible because the issuer would not be the issuer, in such a case, of an electronic record. The purpose of such a restriction is to assure that transferable records can only be created at the time of issuance by
                        the obligor. The possibility that a paper note might be converted to an electronic record and then intentionally destroyed, and the effect of such action, was not intended to be covered by Section 16 [§ 59.1-494].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that the obligor expressly agree in the electronic record to its treatment as a transferable record does not otherwise affect the characterization of a transferable record (i.e., does not affect what would be a paper note) because it is
                        a statutory condition. Further, it does not obligate the issuer to undertake to do any other act than the payment of the obligation evidenced by the transferable record. Therefore, it does not make the transferable record “conditional”
                        within the meaning of Section 3-104(a)(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The control requirements may be satisfied through the use of a trusted third party registry system. Such systems are currently in place with regard to the transfer of securities entitlements under Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, and in the transfer
                        of cotton warehouse receipts under the program sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture. This Act would recognize the use of such a system so long as the standards of subsection (c) were satisfied. In addition,
                        a technological system which met such exacting standards would also be permitted under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, a borrower signs an electronic record which would be a promissory note or document if it were paper. The borrower specifically agrees in the electronic record that it will qualify as a transferable record under this section. The lender implements
                        a newly developed technological system which dates, encrypts, and stores all the electronic information in the transferable record in a manner which lender can demonstrate reliably establishes lender as the person to which the
                        transferable record was issued. In the alternative, the lender may contract with a third party to act as a registry for all such transferable records, retaining records establishing the party to whom the record was issued and all
                        subsequent transfers of the record. An example of this latter method for assuring control is the system established for the issuance and transfer of electronic cotton warehouse receipts under 7 C.F.R. section 735 et seq.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of greatest importance in the system used is the ability to securely and demonstrably be able to transfer the record to others in a manner which assures that only one “holder” exists. The need for such certainty and security resulted in the very stringent
                        standards for a system outlined in subsection (c). A system relying on a third party registry is likely the most effective way to satisfy the requirements of subsection (c) that the transferable record remain unique, identifiable
                        and unalterable, while also providing the means to assure that the transferee is clearly noted and identified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It must be remembered that Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] was drafted in order to provide sufficient legal certainty regarding the rights of those in control of such electronic records, that legal incentives would exist to warrant the development of systems
                        which would establish the requisite control. During the drafting of Section 16 [§ 59.1-494], representatives from the Federal Reserve carefully scrutinized the impact of any electronicization of any aspect of the national payment
                        system. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] represents a compromise position which, as noted, serves as a bridge pending more detailed study and consideration of what legal changes, if any, are necessary or appropriate in the context of the
                        payment systems impacted. Accordingly, Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] provides limited scope for the attainment of important rights derived from the concept of negotiability, in order to permit the development of systems which will satisfy
                        its strict requirements for control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, Issuer agrees to pay a debt by means of a transferable record issued to A. Unless there is agreement between issuer and A that the transferable record “suspends” the underlying obligation (see Section 3-310 of the Uniform Commercial Code),
                        A would not be prevented from enforcing the underlying obligation without the transferable record. Similarly, if A transfers the transferable record to B by means granting B control, B may obtain holder in due course rights against
                        the obligor/issuer, but B’s recourse against A would not be clear unless A agreed to remain liable under the transferable record. Although the rules of Article 3 may be applied by analogy in an appropriate context, in the absence
                        of an express agreement in the transferable record or included by applicable system rules, the liability of the transferor would not be clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a person establishes control, Section 16(d) [§ 59.1-494(d)] provides that that person is the “holder” of the transferable record which is equivalent to a holder of an analogous paper negotiable instrument. More importantly, if the person acquired control
                        in a manner which would make it a holder in due course of an equivalent paper record, the person acquires the rights of a HIDC. The person in control would therefore be able to enforce the transferable record against the obligor
                        regardless of intervening claims and defenses. However, by pulling these rights into Section 16 [§ 59.1-494], this Act does NOT validate the wholesale electronification of promissory notes under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial
                        Code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further, it is important to understand that a transferable record under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494], while having no counterpart under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, would be an “account,” “general intangible,” or “payment intangible” under Article
                        9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Accordingly, two separate bodies of law would apply to that asset of the obligee. A taker of the transferable record under Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] may acquire purchaser rights under Article 9 of
                        the Uniform Commercial Code, however, those rights may be defeated by a trustee in bankruptcy of a prior person in control unless perfection under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code by filing is achieved. If the person in
                        control also takes control in a manner granting it holder in due course status, of course that person would take free of any claim by a bankruptcy trustee or lien creditor.

                            9. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] is a singular exception to the thrust of this Act to simply validate electronic media used in commercial transactions. Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] actually provides a means for expanding electronic commerce. It provides certainty
                            to lenders and investors regarding the enforceability of a new class of financial services. It is hoped that the legal protections afforded by Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] will engender the development of technological and business
                            models which will permit realization of the significant cost savings and efficiencies available through electronic transacting in the financial services industry. Although only a bridge to more detailed consideration of the
                            broad issues related to negotiability in an electronic context, Section 16 [§ 59.1-494] provides the impetus for that broader consideration while allowing continuation of developing technological and business models.

                    A public body of the Commonwealth that adopts standards pursuant to § 59.1-496 and the Secretary of Administration may encourage and promote consistency and interoperability with similar requirements adopted by other public bodies of the Commonwealth,
                    other states and the federal government and nongovernmental persons interacting with public bodies of the Commonwealth. If appropriate, those standards may specify differing levels of standards from which public bodies of the Commonwealth
                    may choose in implementing the most appropriate standard for a particular application.

                            Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] have been bracketed as optional provisions to be considered for adoption by each State. Among the barriers to electronic commerce are barriers which exist in the use of electronic media by state governmental agencies
                            — whether among themselves or in external dealing with the private sector. In those circumstances where the government acts as a commercial party, e.g., in areas of procurement, the general validation provisions of this Act
                            will apply. That is to say, the government must agree to conduct transactions electronically with vendors and customers of government services.

                            The provisions in Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and very general. In many States they will be unnecessary because enacted legislation designed to facilitate governmental use of electronic records and communications is in place. However,
                            in many States broad validating rules are needed and desired. Accordingly, this Act provides these sections as a baseline.

                            The provisions in Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and general to provide the greatest flexibility and adaptation to the specific needs of the individual States. The differences and variations in the organization and structure of governmental
                            agencies mandates this approach. However, it is imperative that each State always keep in mind the need to prevent the erection of barriers through appropriate coordination of systems and rules within the parameters set by
                            the State.

                            Section 17 [§ 59.1-495] authorizes state agencies to use electronic records and electronic signatures generally for intra-governmental purposes, and to convert written records and manual signatures to electronic records and electronic signatures. By its
                            terms the section gives enacting legislatures the option to leave the decision to use electronic records or convert written records and signatures to the governmental agency or assign that duty to a designated state officer.
                            It also authorizes the destruction of written records after conversion to electronic form.

                            Section 18 [§ 59.1-496] broadly authorizes state agencies to send and receive electronic records and signatures in dealing with non-governmental persons. Again, the provision is permissive and not obligatory (see subsection (c)). However, it does provide
                            specifically that with respect to electronic records used for evidentiary purposes, Section 12 [§ 59.1-490] will apply unless a particular agency expressly opts out.

                            Section 19 [§ 59.1-497] is the most important section of the three. It requires governmental agencies or state officers to take account of consistency in applications and interoperability to the extent practicable when promulgating standards. This section
                            is critical in addressing the concern that inconsistent applications may promote barriers greater than currently exist. Without such direction the myriad systems that could develop independently would be new barriers to electronic
                            commerce, not a removal of barriers. The key to interoperability is flexibility and adaptability. The requirement of a single system may be as big a barrier as the proliferation of many disparate systems.

                    <p>
                        However, there are other circumstances when government ought to establish the ability to proceed in transactions electronically. Whether in regard to records and communications within and between governmental agencies, or with respect to information and
                        filings which must be made with governmental agencies, these sections allow a State to establish the ground work for such electronicization.

                    <p>
                        Of paramount importance in all States however, is the need for States to assure that whatever systems and rules are adopted, the systems established are compatible with the systems of other governmental agencies and with common systems in the private
                        sector. A very real risk exists that implementation of systems by myriad governmental agencies and offices may create barriers because of a failure to consider compatibility, than would be the case otherwise.

        Legislative Note Regarding Adoption of Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497]
       </b> 1. Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are optional sections for consideration by individual legislatures for adoption, and have been bracketed to make this clear. The inclusion or exclustion of Sections 17-19
                        [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] will not have a detrimental impact on the uniformity of adoption of this Act, so long as Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] are adopted uniformly as presented. In some States Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495
                        to 59.1-497] will be unnecessary because legislation is already in place to authorize and implement government use of electronic media. However, the general authorization provided by Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] may
                        be critical in some States which desire to move forward in this area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. In the event that a state legislature chooses to adopt Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], a number of issues must be addressed:
                    </p>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <li id="t59.1c42.1s59.1-497-officialcomment.1ol1A">
                            Is the general authorization to adopt electronic media, provided by Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] sufficient for the needs of the particular jurisdiction, or is more detailed and specific authorization necessary? This determination may be affected
                            by the decision regardig the appropriate entity or person to oversee implementation of the use of electronic media (See next paragraph). Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] are broad and general in the authorization granted.
                            Certainly greater specificity can be added subsequent to adoption of these sections. The question for the legislature is whether greater direction and specificity is needed at this time. If so, the legislature should not enact
                            Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] at this time.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c42.1s59.1-497-officialcomment.1ol1B">
                            Assuming a legislature decides to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], what entity or person should oversee implementation of the government’s use of electronic media? As noted in each of Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], again by brackets,
                            a choice must be made regarding the entity to make critical decisions regarding the systems and rules which will govern the use of electronic media by the State. Each State will need to consider its particular structure and
                            administration in making this determination. However, legislatures are strongly encouraged to make compatibility and interoperability considerations paramount in making this determination.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c42.1s59.1-497-officialcomment.1ol1C">
                            Finally, a decision will have to be made regarding the process by which coordination of electronic systems will occur between the various branches of state government and among the various levels of government within the State. Again this will require
                            consideration of the unique situation in each State.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        3. If a State chooses not to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], UETA Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will still apply to governmental entities when acting as a “person” engaging in “transactions” within its scope. The definition of
                        transaction includes “governmental affairs.” Of course, like any other party, the circumstances surrounding a transaction must indicate that the governmental actor has agreed to act electronically (See Section 5(b) [§ 59.1-483(b)]),
                        but otherwise all the provisions of Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will apply to validate the use of electronic records and signatures in transactions involving governmental entities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a State does choose to enact Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497], Sections 1-16 [§§ 59.1-479 to 59.1-494] will continue to apply as above. In addition, Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] will provide authorization for intra-governmental
                        uses of electronic media. Finally, Sections 17-19 [§§ 59.1-495 to 59.1-497] provide a broader authorization for the State to develop systems and procedures for the use of electronic media in its relations with non-governmental
                        entities and persons.

                            “Access contract.” An access contract is an agreement that authorizes access to, or obtaining information from, an electronic facility, including a computer or Internet site, or that allows an equivalent form of access.  The term does not include contracts
                            that merely grant a right to enter a building or other physical location that contains information, or the mere purchase of a television, radio, or similar goods that merely create technological ability to access information.

                            “Agreement.” This definition derives from Uniform Commercial Code § 1-201(3) (1998 Official Text). The term includes full recognition of usage of trade, course of dealing, course of performance and the surrounding circumstances as effective parts of an
                            agreement.  The meaning of the agreement is determined by the language the parties use and their actions, interpreted in the light of commercial practice and other surrounding circumstances.  See Section 116(b) [§ 59.1-501.16(b)];
                            Section 301 [§ 59.1-503.1] (parol evidence rule).   Whether an agreement has legal effect is determined by this Act or other applicable law. Section 117(d) [§ 59.1-501.17(d)].

                            “Attribution procedure.” An “attribution procedure” is a procedure used to identify the person who sent an electronic message or to verify the integrity of its content.  In general, an attribution procedure has substantive effect only if it was agreed
                            to or adopted by the parties or established by applicable law. Agreement to or adoption of a procedure may occur directly between the two parties or through a third party.  For example, the operator of a system that includes
                            information provided by third parties may arrange with database providers and customers for use of a particular attribution procedure. Those arrangements establish an attribution procedure between the customers and the database
                            providers. An attribution procedure may also be established by two parties in the expectation that a third party may rely on it.  For example, a digital signature may be issued to an individual pursuant to an agreement between
                            the issuer and the individual, but then accepted or relied on by another party in a separate transaction.  Use of the signature is an attribution procedure in that transaction. Similarly, a group of member companies may establish
                            attribution procedures intended to bind members in dealing with one another.  Such arrangements are attribution procedures under this Act. The substantive provisions on attribution are in Sections 108, 212 and 213 [§§ 59.1-501.8,
                            59.1-502.13, and 59.1-502.14].

                            in which, when an aspect of the transaction appears irregular, or when a message or transaction fails automated system edits, repair or review by an employee occurs. The transaction qualifies as an automated transaction if

                            “Computer.” The definition of “computer” draws on definitions in federal and state criminal law, tax law and other resources. The term does not include a traditional television set, radio or toaster even though such goods may contain a microprocessor.
                              It might include new generations of machines that combine computation, word processing, Internet access, and traditional broadcast reception. The definition should be applied by the courts with common sense. In various states,
                            unauthorized access to a computer is a crime, but while the definition of computer in those statutes is broad, courts exercise common sense in applying the definition, an approach that should also be true here. Thus, while
                            an automobile might contain a computer or several computers, the automobile is not itself a computer.  A microwave oven with timing and heat operations controlled by software is not a computer, but  ordinary goods enhanced
                            by software.  On the other hand, a desktop computer that receives telephone calls, music, television images, or fax messages is still a computer.

                            (including non-electronic documentation).  As defined, “electronic” includes digital information or information in another form having similar capabilities. This covers analog and future computational technologies, eliminating

                            of computer programs or multimedia products, software and multimedia development contracts, access contracts, and contracts to obtain information for use in a program, access contract, or multimedia product. However, the mere

                        An “access contract” is typified by “on-line” services. It also includes contracts for remote data processing, remote access to applications software or data stored on a third party computer, third party e-mail systems, and contracts for automatic updating
                        from a remote facility to a database held by the licensee. The term does not cover interactions among computer programs within a person’s own system — the access must be to another person’s system or data. Thus, if a licensee of
                        a spreadsheet program uses it to interact with the licensee’s computers and data on the licensee’s own network, that arrangement is not an access contract. However, a person can provide the equivalent of access, and thereby create
                        an access contract, even though the information is only used on the licensee’s system, such as where an on-line data provider elects to provide access to data in part by allowing its database to be loaded into the computer of a
                        client. This performance retains all characteristics of an access contract and is within the definition. The same is true if a database loaded into the user’s system is intermittently updated with data from remote systems. On the
                        other hand, if a software publisher downloads licensed software into a licensee’s system, the continuing right to use the software after it is downloaded is not an access contract.

                        An access provider may, or may not, provide contractual rights in the information accessed. Some transactions entail a three-party framework: in addition to the customer, one licensor provides access, while another (the content provider) licenses the
                        information. This transaction involves two and, in some cases, three contracts. The first is between the content provider and the access provider. The second is between the access provider and the end user. The third arises if
                        the content provider contracts directly with the end user; that too is an access contract. The contracts are independent of each other.

                        ATM cards, “smart cards,” home banking products, and the like enable a customer to obtain information from an information processing system maintained by a financial institution, and would therefore reflect “access contracts” were they not excluded by
                        section 103(d)(1) [§ 59.1-501.3(d)(1)] as a “financial services transaction” (excludes “related identifying, verifying, access-enabling, authorizing or monitoring information).” The parties may otherwise agree to use the contract
                        formation provisions of this Act to enter into the initial customer relationship and thereafter to obtain an ATM card, smart card, or home banking software. They may further agree that the licensing aspects of their relationship
                        will be governed by this Act. If so, the agreement is an “access contract.” The agreement does not subject any transaction effected through use of an ATM card or home banking product to this Act, or alter the rules that would otherwise
                        apply to such transaction.

                        Any “signature” under other law is an authentication under this Act. In addition, authentication includes qualifying use of any identifier, such as a personal identification number (PIN) or a typed or otherwise signed name. It can include actions or sounds
                        such as encryption, voice and biological identification, and other technologically enabled acts if done with proper intent. See Parma Tile Mosaic &amp; Marble Co. v. Short, 87 N.Y.2d 524, 663 N.E.2d 633 (N.Y. 1996) (intent requirement
                        not met). There is no requirement under this Act that the authenticated record be retained by a party, but that requirement may exist under other law.

                    <p>
                        An authentication may be on, logically associated with, or linked to the record. With digital technology, the analogy between signing a record electronically and signing a paper is not precise. “Logically associated” makes it clear that the association
                        between an authentication and a record need not be physical in nature. However, the association must support the inference that the authenticating party intends to adopt or accept the associated or referenced record. See Parma
                        Tile Mosaic &amp; Marble Co. v. Short, 663 N.E.2d 633 (N.Y. 1996) (intent requirement not met). “Referring to” or “linked to” captures the traditional concept of incorporating a record or term by reference, as well as use of an
                        electronic connection, such as an Internet hyperlink.

                    <p>
                        An “authentication” may express various intended effects. What effects are intended are determined by the context and objective indicia associated with that context.

                        This definition focuses on the essence or basic nature of the transaction. Thus, an agreement to use e-mail to communicate about a contract for the shipment of petroleum or to file an application in digital form does not bring the transaction within this
                        definition. A contract for an airline ticket is not a computer information transaction simply because the ticket is in digital form. The subject matter of that agreement is not the computer information, but the service — air transportation.
                        Similarly, this term does not cover professional services or alter standards of professional conduct, such as services rendered by a member of a regulated profession like a doctor or a lawyer. Merely because such professional services
                        are rendered using computer information or the product is delivered in the form of computer information does not convert these professional services to a computer information transaction. See Comments to Section 103 [§ 59.1-501.3].
                        Standards of professional behavior involving interaction with individual clients govern professional services, such as the giving of legal advice or the performance of an operation, and the standards are not affected by this Act.
                        On the other hand, the term does include an agreement to develop a computer program, even if the person developing the program is also a member of a regulated profession.

                        A transaction is not for the “creation” of computer information in the sense intended here if the contracted-for activities are merely secretarial, ministerial, or clerical in nature. The computer information must be created (i.e., produced or developed)
                        through some business, professional, artistic, imaginative, or similar effort. Of course, a transaction that otherwise qualifies and that occurs with respect to information already in the form of computer information is within
                        the definition regardless of how the information was put into that form.

                            beings. This distinction parallels that used in discussions of formal programming languages between syntax (grammar) and semantics (meaning). As used in this Act, “computer program” refers to functional and operating aspects
                            of a digital or similar system, whereas “informational content” refers to material that communicates to a person. In resolving an issue that turns on this distinction, the test lies in whether the issue concerns operations
                            (program) or communicated content (informational content). The definition pertains solely to contract law issues. It does not relate to the copyright law issue of distinguishing between a process and copyrightable expression.
                            It is more like that in copyright law between a computer program as a “literary work” (code) and output as an “audiovisual work” (images, sounds). In copyright, that distinction relates to property rights and infringement issues.
                            In this Act, the distinction relates to contract law issues such as liability risk and performance obligations.

                            not specifically exclude losses that could be avoided by mitigation through cover or otherwise, a duty to mitigate exists under Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7]. A party can recover compensation only for losses that it could not
                            reasonably have avoided. Of course, the idea of avoidance through reasonable steps such as cover or otherwise must be assessed with due regard to how damages are being measured. For example, if recovery is based on a formula
                            related to lost volume, the damages measure itself assumes that engaging in another transaction is not a substitute for the lost transaction and, thus, mitigation through a replacement transaction is not relevant. See discussion
                            of substitute transactions in Sections 808 and 809 [§§ 59.1-508.8 and 59.1-508.9].

                            Consequential damages do not include “direct” or “incidental” damages. Consequential loss includes loss of anticipated benefits as a result of not being able to exploit or rely on the expected contractual performance, such as lost profits of the injured
                            party, lost third-party royalties that would have accrued from a licensee’s proper performance, and lost income from wrongful gains realized by another party from misuse of confidential information. Consequential damages also
                            include damage to reputation, loss of privacy, lost value of a trade secret from wrongful disclosure or use, and losses or damage to data or property caused by a breach.

                            computation, the term “reason to know” should be interpreted in a manner consistent with cases under Uniform Commercial Code Article 2. For an injured party to recover for economic losses resulting from its special circumstances,
                            the party in breach must have had notice of those circumstances at the time of contracting. In contrast, losses from ordinary, general requirements can often be presumed to have been within the contemplation of the other party.
                            To be foreseeable, the losses must not result from atypical risk taking by the aggrieved party, such as in a failure reasonably to maintain back-up systems for retrieval of data.

                        <p>
                            Damage to other property (i.e., not the property that is the subject of the contract itself) may be consequential damage. If injury follows use of a computer program without discovery of a defect causing the damage, the question of “proximate” cause includes
                            whether it was reasonable for the injured party to use the information without inspection that would have revealed the defect. Proximate causation may not exist where damages result from misuse or from a use that violates clear
                            warnings against the particular type of use.

                            does not change requirements of other law that specify the content, timing or location of disclosures or warnings. If such requirements exist, they govern. Sections 104 [§ 59.1-501.4:1] and 116 [§ 59.1-501.16]. Section 104

                            In contexts governed by this Act, a term is conspicuous if it is so positioned or presented that the attention of an ordinary person reasonably ought to have been called to it. Conspicuous terms are often contained in a record, but the concept includes
                            oral or automated voice presentations that meet the standard. For electronic records, whether a term is conspicuous is gauged by the condition of the message as it would be received or first viewed by a person using a system
                            that the parties adopted for such records, a system that the sender knows the recipient is using or, in the absence of the foregoing, an ordinary system or method of receiving or reviewing such messages. For an electronic agent,
                            presentation of the term must be capable of invoking a response from a reasonably configured electronic agent.

        </cite> (10) (1998 Official Text), this Act describes several methods of making a term conspicuous. The illustrations are not exclusive. For cases outside their terms, the general standard governs.

                        <p>
                            The definition adapts the U.C.C. standard to cover electronic commerce. Paragraph (A)(ii) contemplates setting off a term or label by symbols so that conspicuous formatting can be reliably transferred electronically (font size, color and other attributes
                            might not always be transferable). Paragraph (A)(iii) deals with hyperlinks and related Internet technologies. It contemplates a case in which a computer screen displays an image or term or a summary or reference to it, and
                            the party using the screen, by taking an action with reference to it, is promptly transferred to a different display or location wherein the contract term is available. To be conspicuous, the image, term, summary or reference
                            must be prominent and its use must readily enable review of the actual term. The access must be from the display and not require taking other actions such as a telephone call or driving to a store. When the term is accessed,
                            it must be readily reviewable. The fact that an entire contract is prominently referenced does not automatically mean that a particular term in it is conspicuous.

                        <p>
                            Paragraph (B) is independent of paragraph (A). It recognizes a procedure by which, without taking action with respect to the term or reference, the party cannot proceed. Thus, a screen that states: “There are no warranties of accuracy with respect to

                            <i>
         “consumer contract.”
        </i> A “consumer” is an individual (human being) who obtains information primarily for personal, household, or family purposes. Whether an individual is a consumer with reference to a transaction is determined at the
                            time of contracting and in light of the then-intended use of the information. For computer information, many contracts for personal use are not consumer contracts (e.g., stock broker personally using software to monitor client
                            investments). The definition distinguishes profit-making, professional, or business use, from non-business or family use. Only when the contract is primarily for the latter is there a consumer contract. A license of software
                            distributed for general personal use and acquired solely for tracking household finances is a consumer contract, but a transaction acquiring software for use in an investment management business is not a consumer transaction.
                            The profit-making standard is followed in other areas of law. See, e.g., Thoms v. Sundance Properties, 726 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1984); In re Booth, 858 F.2d 1051 (5th Cir. 1988); In re Circle Five, Inc., 75 Bankr. 686 (Bankr.
                            D. Idaho 1987); Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1603 (excludes extensions of credit “primarily for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes”). A purpose stated in the agreement ordinarily determines the purpose of the
                            transaction for purposes of this definition.

                            16. “Contractual use term.” This term includes any enforceable contractual term that defines or limits access to, use or disclosure of information or informational rights. Use terms ordinarily relate only to the copies and information provided under the
                            contract or copies made of them. Unless otherwise agreed, a contractual use term does not govern the same information lawfully obtained from other sources. For this definition, the use restriction must come from a contract
                            and not simply from regulatory or property law. The term must be enforceable to be within the definition. Thus, if trade secret law bars enforcement of a particular term, that term is not a contractual use term under this Act
                            to the extent it is unenforceable.

                            Terms establishing the scope of a license are contractual use terms. Under intellectual property law, however, with respect to determining whether an infringement occurs, not all contract terms are equal. See Sun Microsystems v. Microsoft Corp., 188 F.3d
                            1115 (9th Cir. 1999). This Act does not alter the distinction with reference to infringement claims. In contract law, however, breach of any contractual use term breaches the contract. Whether there is also a right of action
                            for infringement is determined by other law.

                            of when a copy occurs within computer memory or in a transient image does not relate to contract law issues and is not dealt with in this Act.

                            by or perceived from a system of that type if the recipient uses, or otherwise has designated or holds out, that place or system for receipt of copies of the kind.

                            21. “Direct damages.” Direct damages are compensation for losses associated with the value of the contracted for performance itself as contrasted to loss of a benefit expected from use of the performance or its results. Direct damages are measured by
                            Sections 808(b) and 809(a) [§§ 59.1-508.8(b) and 59.1-508.9(a)]. They are capped by the contracted-for price or market value for the performance as appropriate. This Act rejects cases that treat as direct damages losses that

                            agent. The automated system must have been selected, programmed or otherwise intentionally used for that purpose by the person that is bound by its operations. The legal relationship between the person and the electronic agent
                            is not equivalent to common law agency since the “agent” is not a human. However, parties that use electronic agents are ordinarily bound by the results of their operations.

                            If a finance contract creates or provides for a security interest governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the contract is not a “financial accommodation contract”; the interest is governed by Uniform Commercial
                            Code Article 9 and not this Act. An agreement in which royalties for use are paid periodically is not a financial accommodation contract, but simply a royalty-bearing license (or assignment).

                            The phrase “monetary value represented in electronic form” includes electronic currency. The term “financial services transaction” does not include contracts to acquire software for use in banking or other financial service

                            27. “Financier.” A financier is a creditor or a lessor dealing with the licensee under a financial accommodation contract. The financier may have any of several relationships to licensed computer information. In one the financier obtains rights as a licensee
                            for purposes of transfer to the eventual licensee, which is the accommodated party. This is like a finance lease under Uniform Commercial Code Article 2A, but the focus is licensed computer information, rather than leased goods.
                            A second kind of relationship arises where the party giving the accommodation does not obtain rights in the license as against the licensor, but obtains a contractual right to prevent the licensee’s use of the information in
                            the event of breach of the financial accommodation contract.

                            “Observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” is concerned with the fairness of the conduct rather than the care with which an act is performed. Both fair dealing and ordinary reasonable care are judged in
                            light of reasonable commercial standards, but those standards in each case are directed to different aspects of commercial conduct.

                            for example, factual data if subject to a contractual relationship. As used here, “data” refers to facts whether or not organized or interpreted. “Mask work” is defined in federal law; it refers to a representational technology

                            33. “Informational content.” This is information whose ordinary use involves communication of the information to a human being (individual). It is information that humans read, see, hear and otherwise experience. For example, if an electronic database
                            includes images or text and a program enabling display of or access to them, the images are informational content while the search program is not. A Westlaw search program is not informational content, but the text of the cases
                            is. The term applies even if the person creating the informational content does not intend to reveal it to others; this is because preparation involves an intent that the information be perceivable at least by its creator.
                            Informational content need not actually be communicated; it merely must be information that in ordinary use is communicated to individuals. For example, stock quotes are informational content even if an investor uses an electronic
                            agent to make orders and never reads the actual quotes themselves. However, the term does not include computer program instructions in object code that merely control interaction of a computer program with other programs or
                            with a machine or device.

                            in traditional intellectual property law, the rights need not be exclusive as to all other persons and all uses. Other law determines when such rights exist; this Act does not modify those laws. The term does not include mere
                            tort claims such as the right to sue for defamation.

                            separately developed law and excludes them because they are regulated. Section 103. It refers to an agreement between the insurer and insured relating to access to, use, transfer, clearance, settlement, or processing of the
                            policy or contract, or payments or rights to payment under it. As with financial services transactions, the term does not include contracts to acquire software, nor does it apply to non-regulated information services, such
                            as a virtual mall, provided on the insurance institution’s website.

                            37. “License.” A license is an agreement the terms of which entail a limited or conditional transfer of information or a grant of limited or restricted contractual rights or permissions to use information. A contract “right” is an affirmative commitment
                            that a licensee may engage in a specific use, while a contract “permission” means simply that the licensor will not object to the use. Either can be the basis of a license. No specific formality of language is required. For
                            purposes of this Act, the term includes consignments of copies of information but does not otherwise alter the legal nature of a consignment. The definition is solely for purposes of this Act and does not alter treatment under
                            other laws, such as tax law.

                            A transaction is not a license merely because as a matter of law a transferor retains informational property rights that restrict the transferee’s ability to use the information. The term thus does not include an unrestricted sale of a copy of a copyrighted
                            work; an unrestricted sale does not involve express contractual terms restricting use of the information. Similarly, a “copyright notice” in a book that merely states the restrictions on use that remain after a first sale under
                            copyright law is not a license. On the other hand, a software agreement whose terms expressly govern use of the software is a license even if the agreement also gives the licensee ownership of the copy. A license exists if
                            a contract grants greater rights or privileges than a first sale, if it restricts rights or privileges that might otherwise exist, or if it deals with other issues of scope of use.

                            Whether a contract is a license does not depend on who has title to a copy. Title to a copy is distinct from questions about the extent to which use of information is controlled by contract. DSC v. Pulse Communications, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir.
                            1999), cert. den. 528 U.S. 923 (1999) indicates how the issues can be treated. Restrictions in a license that are materially inconsistent with ownership of a delivered copy may result in the holder of the copy not being its
                            owner.

                            Licenses are contracts. Whether the terms of a license are enforceable is determined under this Act and other applicable law, including copyright law. The requirements for an enforceable agreement must be met. The term does not include the myriad non-commercial,
                            casual or other exchanges of information that occur in normal political or social discourse, even if there may be incidental restrictions on use of the information because they do not involve a contractual relationship or a
                            computer information transaction.

        </i> The term “mass market license” is new and the definition must be applied in light of its intended and limited function. That function is to describe small dollar value, routine transactions involving information
                            that is directed to the general public when the transaction occurs in a retail market available to and used by the general public. The term includes all consumer contracts and also some transactions between businesses if they
                            are in a retail market. One purpose of the term is to avoid artificial distinctions among business and consumer transferees in an ordinary retail market. Mass-market transactions do not include commercial transactions between
                            businesses using ordinary commercial methods, such as purchase orders, terms offered to businesses but not to consumers, or online and access systems focused on the business-business marketplace.

                            A “mass-market” transaction is characterized by 1) the market in which the transaction occurs, 2) the
                            <i>
         terms
        </i> of the transaction, and 3) the
                            <i>
         type
        </i> of information involved. The
                            <i>
         market
        </i> is a retail market where information is made available in pre-packaged form under generally similar
                            <i>
         terms
        </i> to the general public as a whole and in which the general public, including consumers, is a frequent participant. “Retail market” has its standard dictionary meaning, which refers to sales (or other transfers)
                            of commodities in small quantities primarily to consumers. The prototypical retail context is a department store, grocery store, gas station, shopping center, or the like. It does not include contexts that center on the business-business
                            trade. Retail locations are open to, and in fact attract, the general public as a whole. The products are available to anyone who enters the retail location and pays the standard retail price. While retail merchants make transactions
                            with other businesses, the predominant type of transaction involves consumers. Transactions in a retail market involve small quantities, non-negotiated terms, and transfers to end users rather than transferees who plan to resell
                            or re-license the product. The phrase “in a quantity” is inherent in the idea of retail and emphasizes that the concept involves purchases of small quantities.

                            The computer information must be of a type aimed at the general public as a whole, including consumers. This does not include information earmarked for a business or professional audience and which is not ordinarily acquired by consumers, nor does it
                            include information earmarked for members of an organization or persons with a separate relationship to the information provider. For example, software provided to and usable only by members of an association or customers of
                            a particular institution, even if otherwise within this Act, are not mass-market transactions. In determining when the term applies, courts should be guided by the purpose of the definition which is to avoid artificial distinctions
                            among business and consumer purchasers in an ordinary retail market. The covered transactions do not include specialty information for business or professional uses, information for specially targeted limited audiences, information
                            distributed in non-retail transactions, or professional use information. The transactions involve computer information routinely acquired by consumers or that tend to appeal to a general public audience as a whole, including
                            consumers. Generally, this is inconsistent with substantial customization of the information for a particular end user. Customization that is routine in mass markets or that is done by the licensee after acquiring the information
                            does not take the transaction outside the concept of a mass-market transaction.

                        <p>
                            The transaction must be with an end user. An end user is a licensee that intends to use the information or informational rights in its own business or personal affairs. An end user is not engaged in reselling, distributing, sublicensing, commercial public
                            performances of the information, or otherwise making the information commercially available to third parties, directly or indirectly.

                            All consumer transactions are mass-market. For non-consumer transactions, subsection (B)(iii) expressly excludes several transactions commonly not associated with routine retail transactions. It excludes any transaction intended for redistribution of
                            the information by further license, loan or sale, or for public performance of a copyrighted work. Such transactions involve no attributes of a retail market. For purposes of this Act, public performance or display does not
                            include use by a library patron of software acquired by the library in the mass market. In online contracts, consumer contracts are mass-market transactions, but business to business transactions are not. Business acquisition
                            of software through online access and other non-retail transactions are outside of the definition. This gives electronic commerce room to develop without regulation while preserving consumer interests.

                            40. “Merchant.” This definition is from Uniform Commercial Code § 2-104 (1998 Official Text). The definition covers a person that holds itself out as experienced even if the person has not actually engaged in prior transactions of the type. The term “merchant”
                            has roots in the “law merchant” concept of an expert or professional in business. This status may be based on specialized knowledge as to the information or general or specialized knowledge about business practices, or both.
                            Which type of knowledge is sufficient for merchant status is determined by the nature of the issue to which the term applies. In this Act, as relevant to business practices, “merchant” refers primarily to businesses with general
                            knowledge of business practices in any field, rather than to expertise in a specific field. Section 401(a) and (e) [§ 59.1-504.1(a) and (e)] and Section 403 [§ 59.1-504.3], however, require a more focused expertise in the particular
                            type of information.

                            When a party employs an agent, merchant status does not always depend on the principal’s knowledge. An organization is charged with the expertise of its employees. Even persons such as universities, for example, can come within the definition of merchant
                            if they have regular purchasing departments or personnel familiar with business practices.

                            not to sue. It does not convey property rights in the information to the licensee.

                            phrase “special relationship of reliance” refers to transactions in which the provider knows that a particular licensee plans to rely on particular data provided by the licensor and that the licensee expects the licensor to
                            tailor the information to the client’s specific business or personal needs. That type of relationship arises only with respect to licensors who possess unique or specialized expertise or who are in a special position of confidence
                            and trust with the particular licensee such that reliance is justified and the licensor has a duty to act with care. In a special relationship of reliance the information provider is specifically aware of and personally tailors
                            information to the needs of the particular licensee as an integral part of the provider’s primary business. A reliance relationship does not arise for information made generally available to a group in standard form, even if
                            those who receive the information subscribe to the service because they believe it is relevant to their commercial or personal needs.

                            to a place designated or held out by the recipient for such notices even if the place is controlled by a third party. Arrival at an appropriate private post office box is receipt even if the addressee does not remove or read
                            the message until later. Similarly, arrival at an appropriate electronic mail address is receipt by the addressee. The definition is met by arrival at a location only if the person holds out that location or system as a place
                            for receiving notices of the kind. Parties often require that notice be to a particular address or person. If parties agree to send notice to a particular e-mail address, arrival at that location suffices; delivery to a different

                            the system. Whether the message actually is processed is not relevant to receipt; similarly, a letter placed in a party’s post office box is received even if not opened.

                            48. “Record.” A record must be in, or capable of being retrieved in, perceivable form. Electronic text recorded in a computer memory that could be printed or displayed from that memory constitutes a record. Similarly, a tape recording of an oral conversation
                            or a video taping of actions could be a record.

                            49. “Release.” A release is a waiver or a nonexclusive permission not accompanied by other commercial attributes such as an ongoing obligation to pay or an obligation to provide the means to make use of the information. A release is a form of license.
                            The term is used in this Act to identify transactions in which the sole purpose is to permit use and applies where agreements of the type are often made on a less formal basis than a commercial license. Some releases are enforceable
                            as “quasi-contracts.” This Act does not change that law.

                            50. “Return.” In this Act, a “return” refers to acts that restore a party to its initial position if the party rejected contract terms in a record and, as a result, the transaction will not be carried forward. See sections 113, 208, and 209 [§§ 59.1-501.13:1,
                            59.1-502.8, and 59.1-502.9]. A return requires redelivery to the licensor or its agent of any computer information already delivered that would have been covered by the rejected contract. When a licensee declines the contract,
                            “return” entails reimbursement of any fees paid on re-delivery of all copies of the information and documentation. The information and documentation must be re-delivered in their original condition. By consent of the licensor,
                            the copies can be destroyed in accordance with its instructions. A right to a return under this Act applies only to computer information and does not affect goods, such as a computer that contains the software.

                        <p>
                            Return is not a remedy for breach. It is a right created by this Act or the agreement that arises if a party refuses contract terms but had previously committed to, or actually paid the contract fee. A right of return allows the party a meaningful opportunity
                            to decide to accept or reject the contract. If a party accepts contract terms, there is no right to a return, but if the computer information is defective, the aggrieved party may have a right to refuse the product and recover
                            the contract fee and any other appropriate damages as a remedy for breach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A return must be sought within a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time depends on the terms of the agreement or, if the agreement is silent, the commercial context. Section 117 [§ 59.1-501.17].
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A right to a return may arise in “bundled” information products (products that include separate information products transferred as a whole for a single fee). Pricing in bundled transactions is not based on summing the fees that would be required for
                            each product in an unbundled setting; often, bundled products include information products provided for no or a lesser charge, even though the information might have a different price in other transactions. In some cases, there
                            is no fee attributable to any of the bundled information products included with other products, such as a computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If separate bundled products are separately priced, a return is for the contract fee for the information product as to which the contract terms were rejected. Otherwise, a return must be of the entire bundled product and reimbursement of the entire price,
                            if any, attributed to that entire product. For a return for a separately stated price to occur, the contract price for the item must be separately stated in the sense that the agreement identified an amount for the particular
                            information. A court cannot unbundle products and estimate appropriate prices in what is often a complex commercial arrangement premised on the economics of bundling multiple products. If no price is attributed in the agreement
                            to the bundled information products, a return does not require reimbursement of a fee since none has been charged.

                            51. “Scope.” This definition refers to contract terms that define the central elements of a license that relate to aspects of use of the information. Scope terms define the product. The same computer information has entirely different commercial characteristics
                            and value depending on the scope of rights licensed. See

         Graham v. James,
        </i> 144 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 1998). A license that allows use of a word processing program in a single computer is not the same product as a license to make and distribute copies of that word processing software throughout
                            a region. Neither license is the same product as a license that transfers a copy but limits use to three days at home. They are all different even though the program and the copy may be exactly the same and the differences
                            can only be determined by reading the license.

                            53. “Standard form.” The definition refers to forms, not standard terms. A form consists of record containing a group of terms prepared for frequent use as a contract. The definition does not cover a tailored contract comprised of “terms” selected from
                            multiple prior agreements. The form must have been actually used without negotiation other than of the terms noted in the definition. If a standard form is offered but then negotiated or changed other than with respect to those
                            ordinarily tailored terms, the resulting record of the contract is not a standard form. “Negotiated” for purposes of this definition means actually bargained for or about, or pointed out with an opportunity for meaningful bargaining,
                            even if assented to without actual bargaining.

                            or sublicense. Some of these transfers might be described as an assignment of the contract.

                            57. “Usage of trade.” This term is from Uniform Commercial Code §

         <a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c2.1a02s1-205" target="_blank">
          1-205
         </a>
        </cite> (1998 Official Text). This Act treats usage of trade as a factor in determining the commercial meaning of the agreement. The language of an agreement is interpreted as meaning what it may fairly be expected
                            to mean to parties involved in the particular commercial transaction in a given locality or in a given vocation or trade. A usage of trade must have the “regularity of observance” indicated in the text. It is not required that
                            a usage be “ancient or immemorial,” “universal” or the like. Full recognition is available for new uses and for uses currently observed by the majority of merchants, even though some do not. There is room also for appropriate
                            recognition of usage agreed by merchants in trade codes.

                            General Structure. This section states the scope of this Act. Subsection (a) states the affirmative scope. Subsections (b) and (c) establish rules for transactions where more than one subject matter is involved and not all of the subject matter is within
                            subsection (a).   Subsection (d) sets out exclusions from the Act.

                            Transactions in Computer Information. This Act deals with contracts and not property law. It applies to computer information transactions. In a computer information transaction, the transferee seeks the information and contractual rights to use it. Unlike
                            a buyer of goods, a purchaser (e.g., buyer, lessee, or licensee) of computer information has little interest in the diskette or tape that originally contained the information after that information has been loaded into a computer,
                            unless the information remains on that media and nowhere else. Indeed, in online transactions in computer information, there is often no tangible medium at all.

                                    Contracts to Create or Develop Computer Information. This Act applies to contracts to develop, modify, or create software and other computer information, such as a computer database.  Section 102(a)(11) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(11)]. Except as excluded in subsection
                                    (d), the Act covers all software development contracts, thus resolving conflicts in prior case law.

                                    Computer Programs. This Act applies to transactions involving distribution of, or grant of a right to use, a computer program, whether they involve a license or an unrestricted sale of a copy of a program. Section 102(a)(11) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(11)]. The
                                    difference between a license and an unrestricted sale, however, is relevant within the Act. A license may involve either a more substantial retention of rights or a greater transfer of rights than an unrestricted sale
                                    of a copy. While most provisions of this Act apply to all transactions within its scope, some are limited solely to licenses. The coverage of each section is explicit in the section.

                                    under which data, text or images are provided to licensees by access to the provider’s system or location on Internet.

                                    types of information into an integrated, often interactive work.  Interactivity is a characteristic of software-based products. For a discussion of what is a multimedia work, see Copyright Office Circular (Multimedia

                            Transactions Outside the Act. The scope of this Act is limited by the affirmative definitions of “computer information” and “computer information transaction,” which exclude print and various other forms of information distribution, and by the exclusions
                            in subsection (d).  As a result, the Act leaves unaffected all transactions in the traditional core businesses of non-digital information industries.  Whether a magazine, book or newspaper publisher can contractually limit
                            or expand rights of use of information by purchasers of copies and what contract liability arises for print works is outside this Act, as are the following:

                            Mixed Transactions. A computer information transaction may involve computer information and other subject matter. This presents a question of  whether all or any part of the transaction is governed by this Act, common law, or an article of the Uniform
                            Commercial Code.  The circumstance that a contract is governed by more than one source of contract law is common in modern commerce. For example:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li id="t59.1c43a01s59.1-501.3-officialcomment.1ol14a">
                                    Computer Information and U.C.C. Subject Matter. If a transaction includes computer information and subject matter governed by an article of the Uniform Commercial Code, in the absence of contrary agreement, the general rule is that the rules of the Uniform
                                    Commercial Code apply to their subject matter and this Act applies to its subject matter. That rule is stated in subsection (b)(1), subsection (c), and subsection (d)(8). For example, under subsection (d)(8), Uniform
                                    Commercial Code Article 8, and not this Act, deals with investment securities, while Articles 4 and 4A, and not this Act, deal with payments, checks, and funds transfers. Under subsection (c), if there is a conflict
                                    between a provision of this Act and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9 prevails. This preserves uniformity in Article 9’s application across a wide variety of personal property financing transactions.

                                    Computer Information and Goods Generally. Some transactions include goods and computer information. “Goods” is defined for purposes of this Act in Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2]. Generally, there is no overlap between goods and computer information since
                                    computer information and informational rights are not goods.  See, e.g., United States v. Stafford, 136 F.3d 1109 (7th Cir. 1998), cert. den., Allison v. United States, 525 U.S. 849 (1998); Specht v. Netscape Communications

                                    diskette is a tangible object but the information on the diskette does not become goods simply because it is copied on tangible medium, any more than the information in a book is governed by the law of goods because
                                    the book binding and paper may be Article 2 goods. See, e.g., Winter v. G.P. Putnam’s Sons, 938 F.2d 1033 (9th Cir. 1991); Grappo v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.p.A., 56 F.3d 427 (2d Cir. 1995); Gilmer v Buena

                                            General Rule. If a transaction involves goods and computer information (e.g., a computer and software), the general rule is that Article 2 or Article 2A applies to the aspect of the transaction pertaining to the sale or lease of goods, but this Act applies
                                            to the computer information and aspects of the agreement relating to the creation, modification, access to, or transfer of it.  Section 103(b)(1) [§ 59.1-501.3(b)(1)]. Each body of law governs as to its own
                                            subject matter. Some describe this as a “gravamen of the action” standard.  The law applicable to an issue depends on whether the issue pertains to goods or to computer information. A similar distinction exists
                                            in copyright law between ownership of a copy and ownership of the copyright. See, e.g., 17 U.S.C. § 202; DSC Communications Corp. v. Pulse Communications, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999), cert. den. 528

                                            Exceptions to General Rule: Copy and Documentation. There are exceptions to the general rule’s gravamen test. Thus, this Act treats the medium that carries the computer information as part of the computer information and within this Act, whether the medium
                                            is a tangible object or electronic. This Act applies to the copy, documentation, and packaging of computer information; these are within the definition of computer information itself. Section 102. They are mere

This Act applies to the program, while goods law applies to the goods. In some cases, however, an embedded program
                                            is a mere part of the goods and this Act should not apply.

                        The scope of this Act turns initially on the definition of “computer information transaction.” Section 102(11) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(11)]. “Computer information transactions” are agreements that deal with the creation, modification, access to, license, or
                        distribution of computer information. Section 102(a)(11) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(11)]. “Computer information” is information in a form directly capable of being processed by, or obtained from, a computer and any copy, associated documentation,
                        or packaging. Section 102(a)(10) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(10)]. As stated in subsections (b) and (c), if a transaction is a computer information transaction but also involves other subject matter, this Act ordinarily applies only to the
                        aspects of the transaction that involve “computer information.”

                    <p>
                        This Act deals with a variety of transactions central to the information economy where the contractual subject matter is computer information. However, the mere fact that communications about a transaction, such as an application for a loan or employment,
                        are sent or recorded in digital form does not place the transaction within this Act. Thus, a contract for airplane transportation is not a computer information transaction even though the ticket is in digital form. The subject
                        matter is not computer information, but the service — transportation. A contract to create and publish a print book does not become a computer information transaction simply because the author chooses or is required to deliver
                        the work on a computer diskette. Similarly, an insurance policy prepared in digital form is not a computer information transaction; it is a contract for insurance coverage the terms of which are evidenced in digital form. A contract
                        for a digital signature certificate is a contract for certification or identification services, not a contract whose subject matter is the computer information.

                        Indeed, virtually all contracts of all types involve “mixed” law. Thus, the issue is not whether multiple sources of contract law apply, but to what extent this Act applies in lieu of other law. Subsections (b) and (c) address that question based on the
                        issue presented, the type of transaction, and applicable commercial policies.

                    <p>
                        With respect to the materiality standard, this Act excludes a copy of the computer program if the copy is embedded in, inseparable from, and sold or leased as an indistinguishable part of goods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The standards for determining when this exception to the general rule arise focus on the nature of the goods containing the copy and on the importance of the program and access to it in the transaction in those goods. Thus, for example, this Act does
                        not apply to a copy of a program on a computer chip embedded as part of an automobile engine and sold or leased as an indistinguishable part of the automobile containing the engine. On the other hand, this Act does apply to a copy
                        of a program contained on a computer chip in a computer and transferred along with the computer. Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 (2000 Official Text) addresses a similar issue, but the rules there deal with issues about creating
                        and perfecting security interests under that statute; they are not pertinent to general contract law and are not adopted here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b)(1) sets out the applicable standards under this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First: This Act applies to the computer program and the copy of it if the goods in which the copy is embedded is a computer or a computer peripheral. As stated in Official Comment 7 to Section 102, “computer” should be given a common sense definition.
                        Thus, a commercial choice to distribute a program in embedded form, rather than in a form that requires it to be loaded into a computer or peripheral does not affect the applicability of this Act. For example, software for a medical
                        imaging device that relies on computer program capabilities is within this Act whether the program is embedded in the imaging device or loaded into it after purchase. On the other hand a chip in a toaster that controls the ordinary
                        functions of an ordinary toaster is not a “computer” in a common sense application of the term. Of course, this Act does not apply to the computer, but only to the program (and copy) and other computer information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second: If a copy of a computer program is sold or leased as part of goods other than a computer or computer peripheral, this Act applies to the program (and the copy) if giving the buyer or lessee of the goods access to or use of the program is ordinarily
                        a “material purpose” of this type of transaction. If not, this Act does not apply to the copy of the program. While this test may involve close decisions in individual cases, bright line tests are not possible and that result is
                        inevitable as the digital information revolution continues to transform commerce. The blurred nature of the issue of determining whether the embedded program should be treated separately is recognized in other contexts. For example,
                        in reference to tax law determinations, accounting standards refer to whether the program is a mere incident of the goods and recognize that determining when or whether this is true cannot involve a firm line, but rather a factual
                        or contextual determination. See AICPA, Statement of Position 97-2 (1997). The issues for contract law differ from those involved in tax (or secured lending), but the nature of the distinction in each context is not one susceptible
                        to bright line determination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Materiality is judged on an objective sense, reflecting transactions of the type, rather than the subjective goals or intent of the particular parties. Furthermore, materiality focuses on ordinary transactions in goods of the type. Thus, the fact that
                        a program is contained in and sold or leased as a part of goods that are a small part of a billion dollar transaction involving many other assets does not take it out of this Act if, as to the particular goods or system containing
                        the program, access to the program is material.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic issue is whether the program and its capabilities are ordinarily important to the purpose in obtaining the goods. Courts should rely on the aspects of the ordinary commercial context. One issue involves between whom the pertinent part of a transaction
                        occurs. Some transactions involve three parties and two agreements. If goods are sold by a vendor but the buyer must obtain a license from a publisher for use of the program, as to the license between the publisher and buyer, the
                        computer information is clearly material. Beyond that, factors pertaining to whether access to or use of the program is material include the extent to which the computer program’s capabilities are a material part of the appeal
                        of the product, the extent to which negotiation focused on that capability, the extent to which the agreement made the program’s capacity a separate focus, whether there are significant post-transaction obligations of program support,
                        and the extent to which the program is or could be made available commercially separate and apart from the goods. Compare AICPA, Statement of Position 97-2 (1997). Materiality is ordinarily clear if the program is separately licensed
                        as part of the transaction. A separately licensed program for a digital camera that enables the camera to link to a computer is within this Act. On the other hand, the mere fact that ordinary functions of ordinary goods rely on
                        a program embedded in the goods does not indicate that program is governed by this Act. The braking functions of an automobile may be controlled by embedded programs, but in a retail transaction, the purpose is obtaining the automobile’s
                        functionality rather than the program; this Act would not apply to a copy of brake software contained in and sold as part of a car. Upstream contracts to develop or supply the program to the manufacturer, however, are within this
                        Act. A sale of an ordinary television that uses a computer program to preset channels is not in this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under subsection (b)(2), if the dominant character of an agreement is to create or to obtain rights to create a motion picture and that part of the agreement is excluded under subsection (d), this Act does not apply to any part of the agreement. Contracting
                        practices in this part of the motion picture industry follow established, unique patterns. The rule here applies only to the extent that the motion picture aspect of the transaction is excluded under subsection (d)(3)(A). If an
                        agreement is for rights to make a motion picture from the book Tractor Monster, but also includes rights to create a Tractor Monster computer game, this Act does not apply to the agreement at all if the dominant character of the
                        agreement is one for creating or obtaining rights to create the motion picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As used here, “dominant character” does not mean merely a material or primary part. It requires more than in the “predominant purpose” test applied by some courts in relation to goods and services. The term refers to the fundamental character of the agreement.
                        The motion picture rights must clearly be the focus of the agreement for both parties; it is not sufficient merely that their value or price ultimately exceeds the value of other aspects of the agreement. Whether motion picture
                        rights are the dominant character is determined by an objective analysis of the circumstances of the transaction and transactions of the particular type. The dominance of motion picture rights must be clear and other rights secondary
                        such that the transaction would not reasonably be viewed as other than as for motion picture rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When creating or obtaining rights to create a motion picture comprise the dominant character of the agreement, this Act does not apply. If the motion picture rights are not the dominant character of the agreement or if the contract does not involve creating
                        or rights to create a motion picture, this Act applies to the computer information (e.g., the computer game) and other law applies to the motion picture to the extent excluded under subsection (d)(3)(A). If both computer information
                        and motion picture rights are equally important, the dominant character rule does not apply because neither subject matter comprises the sole dominant character of the agreement; this Act applies to the computer information, while
                        other law applies to the motion picture aspect excluded under subsection (d). Where there is a third subject matter involved (e.g., services or goods), other rules of this subsection apply with respect to the coverage by this Act
                        of the other subject matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a transaction includes several agreements among different parties related to a common goal, the character of each agreement is determined with respect to the particular agreement. For example, an agreement to use encryption or imaging software in a
                        particular project is a software license and that agreement is not affected by the coexistence of a related but separate agreement for motion picture rights. Under general law, the parties can in all cases agree about whether the
                        transaction is or is not governed entirely by this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If obtaining the computer information or informational rights in it is the primary purpose of the transaction, this Act applies to the entire transaction, except for subject matter excluded by subsection (d). The test asks a court to consider whether
                        the computer information or other subject matter (e.g., services) is the main focus. This adopts, for mixed information and services transactions, a variant of the predominant purpose test used under Article 2 with respect to goods
                        and services. In this Act, however, the test only asks whether this Act should apply to other subject matter. In all cases, this Act will apply to the computer information. The primary purpose test requires less than the dominant
                        character test in subsection (b)(2). In considering whether, under the primary purpose test, this Act should apply to the entire transaction, a court should consider the type of transaction envisioned by the parties. While cases
                        under Article 2 provide guidance, it is appropriate to consider additional factors. Courts should consider the extent to which the transaction as a whole corresponds to the framework of information transactions, such as: 1) the
                        nature of any underlying intellectual property rights involved, including differences in the rights provided for different types of works, 2) the extent to which clear allocation of liability risk is a concern, and 3) the extent
                        to which coverage by this Act of the other subject matter in the transaction will correspond to reasonable expectations of the parties as to how the legal issues should be handled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same test applies throughout the various levels of use or distribution, but the results may differ at each level for the same information. For example, a courier company that licenses communications software from a software publisher is engaged in
                        a transaction entirely within this Act. If the courier company provides the software to customers to access data on the location of their packages, the primary purpose may have to do with the services the courier provides. Even
                        then, however, this Act applies to the software. If the software publisher enters into a license with the end user, as between the publisher and the end user, that license is entirely within this Act because the primary purpose
                        of that agreement is the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules of subsection (b) do not apply if the agreement specifies to what extent this Act governs. If the parties elect coverage under this Act, that agreement generally governs as would an agreement that this Act should not apply at all. Agreement
                        here, as elsewhere, can be found in the express terms of the contract as well as in the usage of trade or course of dealing between the parties, or as inferred from the commercial circumstances of the contracting.

                    <p>
                        Similar considerations apply for insurance services transactions in that they are subject to extensive regulation and separately developed law. In addition, these insurance transactions deal with insurance coverage and payment matters, rather than with
                        computer information as the focus. The exclusion of insurance transactions refers to agreements between insurer and insured relating to access to, use, transfer, clearance, settlement, or processing of the policy or contract, or
                        payments or rights to payment under it.

                        “Financial services transaction” is defined in Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2]. Financial services transactions are similar in many ways to computer information transactions in that they entail trade in symbols, albeit symbols of very different use and effect,
                        and share some common legal issues: e.g., authenticity, data integrity, and authority. See Section 102, comment 26. However, they will often be governed by very different rules in that, in many cases, the digital subject matter
                        of a financial transaction is the value it represents. An appropriate book entry, for example,
                        <i>
        is
       </i> a securities entitlement. UCC § 8-501(b)(1)(1998 Official Text). Also, core financial services practices are mature subjects of other bodies of law, such as UCC Articles 3, 4, 4A, 5, 7, 8 and UCC Article 9. For all
                        of these reasons it was deemed essential to exclude financial services transactions from the scope of this Act and to define financial services transaction broadly.

                    <p>
                        The exclusion under subsection (d)(1) does not exclude banks as entities. Many financial services regulations (e.g., Regulation E of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) do not apply solely to banks but to any holder of a qualifying account.
                        To the extent that non-banks engage in the activities covered by the exclusion, those activities are excluded from this Act. On the other hand, banks engage as licensors and as licensees in many computer information transactions;
                        those transactions, if not covered by this exclusion, are within this Act. Examples include licensing computer software and contracts providing on-line shopping and access to third-party databases. Where a bank provides software
                        to a customer to be used in part in online access, this Act would govern the software license except to the extent the issue involves questions excluded by this subsection or dealt with in an article of the U.C.C., such as Article
                        4A, or in preemptive federal law.

                    <p>
                        Business practices in reference to these excluded transactions differ substantially from practices involving computer information. However, this is not an industry exclusion. To the extent that motion picture, broadcast and other covered companies engage
                        in software licensing or other forms of computer information transactions that are not excluded, this Act applies. Also, the exclusion does not apply to contract issues pertaining to submission of information or ideas, or to releases
                        of informational property rights. Here, practices are similar and it is often impractical to distinguish between an idea or a release in terms of whether it is associated with one or another type of informational work. Coverage
                        of all such transactions reflects these factors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, the exclusion does not apply to mass-market transactions involving audio-visual programming or motion pictures. The information industries are rapidly converging and, for those engaged in computer information based transactions, the convergence
                        is most pronounced in the mass market. Limiting the exclusion with respect to such transactions reduces the circumstances in which potentially artificial distinctions are drawn between digital information products.

                    <p>
                        The exclusions in subsection (d)(3) include agreements to create, perform or include information in the excluded subject matter. To be within the exclusion, both parties must know that the agreement is for a particular work that entails such subject matter.
                        For example, a license generally authorizing use of digital graphics for multiple purposes is not within the exclusion simply because a particular licensee uses the graphics in a motion picture. To be in the exclusion, the agreement
                        must be to include the digital graphics in the motion picture, sound recording or other excluded subject matter. A license for editing or effects software that can be used for multiple purposes, is covered by this Act and not excluded
                        by subsection (d)(3) even if one of its uses is in the creation of a motion picture. Similarly, a software license for use of encryption software generally in products that are motion pictures or sound recordings is not excluded.

                    <p>
                        The terms “motion picture,” “sound recording,” “musical work,” and “phonorecord” have the meanings associated with those terms in the Copyright Act as of the indicated date and also the meaning set out in subsections (e) and (f). That interpretation applies
                        as of that date for all purposes and with reference to all sources as of that date, including final decisions of courts. The exclusion includes creation or distribution of these works in digital form. The Copyright Act and registration
                        system makes distinctions among and between various types of works, such as audiovisual works, literary works, computer programs, motion pictures, and sound recordings. These distinctions are followed here. The exclusion additionally
                        employs a slightly expanded definition of “motion picture,” and a new term, “enhanced sound recording,” to cover digital products that have elements beyond ordinary sound recordings or motion pictures (e.g., a program to allow
                        use of the work), but which do not change the fundamental nature of the work as a sound recording or linear motion picture. In each case, the intent is that including instructions or other information does not affect the exclusion
                        so long as the product’s dominant character remains a sound recording or linear motion picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term “enhanced sound recording” encompasses products such as enhanced music CDs, audio DVDs and the products commonly known as music videos. A music video qualifies as an enhanced sound recording because its dominant character consists of recorded
                        sounds, even though it also includes visual depiction of a performance or series of performances of a nondramatic musical work or works. For purposes of this section, a music video is to be distinguished from a motion picture featuring
                        music, a motion picture of a musical play, opera, concert or variety show, or a documentary concerning a recording artist or other music-related subject. A music video is also to be distinguished from audio or visual programming
                        featuring music videos, which is treated under subsection (d)(3)(A).

                    <p>
                        Multimedia works are within this Act. For purposes of this Act, the term “motion picture” focuses on linear works and does not include an interactive computer game, multimedia product, or similar work, nor does it include audio-visual effects within interactive
                        works. The term does not refer to images or visual motion within another work or within software, such as the animated help feature of a word processing program or images or motion in an interactive computer encyclopedia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (d)(3) excludes contracts for audio and visual programming distributed by broadcast, cable, or satellite regardless of whether transmitted in digital or another form, including transmissions analogous to broadcast made through the Internet.
                        See Subsection 103(f) [§ 59.1-501.3(g)] (defining this type of programming). The federal Communications Act and associated regulations define terms associated with this exclusion and the intent is to adopt that terminology as of
                        the indicated date, but not subsequent changes. The terms broadcast and cable programming do not include interactive computer services or similar information services that entail a service, a system, or access software that provides
                        or enables access by multiple users to a computer system or the information provided through or from it. See Washington Revised Code § 19.190.010; America Online, Inc. v. Greatdeals.Net, 49 F. Supp.2d 851 (E.D. Va. 1999) (“any
                        information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such
                        systems offered by libraries or educational institutions.”). Agreements for access to Internet and similar information services are not covered by the exclusion. Similarly, the term “programming” does not refer to software or computer
                        programs as they may be programmed by a licensor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What must be insignificant is that the information is in the form of computer information as contrasted to another form, such as in written form. If the information could not be provided in any other form under the agreement and still fulfill the purpose
                        of the agreement with respect to it, the form can never be insignificant, such as where the computer information is a computer operating system. This is true even if the software is provided in a transaction for goods that in cost
                        far exceed the value of the software. To function as an operating system under the agreement, the form can never be insignificant. Similarly, if a party acquires a billion dollar robotics system involving robots and computers along
                        with software that operates each, the fact that the price of the software is small as compared to the billion dollar total deal does not exclude coverage of this Act over the software aspect of the agreement. Rather, the form of
                        the information as computer information in this transaction is essential to the agreement because the software must be in a form to operate the computer and robots.

                            Consumer Law Controls. This Act does not alter the scope, applicability, or substantive effect of consumer protection laws. In cases of conflict, the consumer protection law controls. However, consistent with the federal Electronic Signatures in Global
                            and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7001 et. seq., this section permits commerce in electronic form including in consumer cases.

                            Standard of Conspicuousness. Some consumer protection laws require that particular terms be displayed in a conspicuous manner. Subsection (c) makes clear that, as to such laws, the general principle that this Act defers to consumer protection law includes
                            deference to how those laws interpret or define “conspicuousness” with reference to that requirement; the second sentence of subsection (c) provides a limited exception needed for electronic commerce. In cases where a conspicuousness
                            requirement arises solely from this Act or where there is no standard in or pertaining to the consumer protection law, the definition of conspicuous under this Act controls.

                            Records and Authentication. Subsection (d) confirms an electronic commerce principle that is widely accepted nationally: electronic signatures and records suffice to meet requirements of a writing or a signature in most laws, including most consumer protection
                            laws. The reference to Section 905 is intended to bring in applicable federal procedural requirements for obtaining a consumer’s consent to substitute electronic disclosures for those required by law to be delivered in writing
                            and to make it clear that this Act does not alter the provisions of other law on use of electronics for certain forms of notices if they apply to transactions covered by this Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001(c), 7003(b).

                            Assent. Subsection (e) confirms that the basic principle making consumer protection laws controlling applies to cases where those laws establish requirements of assent and the like. That principle is subject to the rule that assent can be made electronically.
                            In turn, when the limitations spelled out in federal law for consumer “written” disclosure laws and some notice rules apply, the UCITA rule is subject to the applicable federal rule.

                            Applicability of Consumer Protection Law. The effect of the principle that consumer protection laws trump this Act depends on how those laws define their scope. Subsection (f) makes clear that this Act does not alter the scope of any consumer protection
                            law, including any law giving regulatory jurisdiction to a particular state agency. Thus, a consumer protection law applicable to “services” applies to any service transactions within the scope of this Act to the same extent
                            and without any change as it would have applied without enactment of this Act. If courts or regulators interpreted that statute to cover online services before enactment of this Act, that interpretation remains effective as
                            to such services in this Act. If no prior interpretations were made on that issue, or if the issue of scope of the consumer protection law does arise, then that issue should be resolved by considering the policies, language
                            and content of that consumer protection law, not this Act. The same analysis applies to a consumer protection statute that applies to “goods.” The meaning of that scope requires analysis of that statute and its policies; this
                            Act does not alter that analysis.

                    <p>
                        This Act deals with general contract law. It does not promulgate a consumer protection code, although the Act does contain numerous consumer protections. This Act leaves further consumer protection concepts to the consumer protection law of the particular
                        State. This approach is consistent with the approach of other general uniform law, including UCC Article 2 and Article 9, which defer to consumer protection laws. Historically, consumer protection statutes have varied State-by-State.
                        Except for the limited e-commerce rules in this section, a State’s consumer protection statutes trump this Act whenever a conflict arises. For example, consumer protection statutes regulating advertising, mandating disclosure of
                        the licensor’s main business office, requiring disclosure of a term in specified manner, typeface or the like, or providing for treble damages for particular acts, are not altered by this Act and their provisions over-ride any
                        inconsistent rule contained in this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A “consumer protection law” reflects the judgment of the State’s legislature expressed through statutes, or of the State’s regulatory agencies or executives expressed through regulations or equivalent actions, that a consumer should receive special protection.
                        A statute or a provision thereof can be fairly described as a consumer protection statute only if it contains protections or rights specifically earmarked for or primarily intended to apply to consumers and that gives consumers
                        greater protection than other parties in similar transactions. The term includes judicial or regulatory interpretations of such laws. While this Act defers to such determinations, the term does not include common law rules that
                        are judicial in derivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (f) also recognizes that many consumer protection laws do not by their terms cover transactions within this Act. It would be inappropriate and beyond the prerogative of this or any Act to amend all of those laws automatically to apply to the
                        subject matter of this Act, because many deal with particular circumstances that are not relevant to computer information transactions. Subsection (f) invites legislatures to undertake an analysis that must occur with or without
                        enactment of this Act — an analysis to determine whether or which consumer protection laws in a state should be amended expressly to apply to the subject matter covered here and whether and what other changes need to be made to
                        the consumer protection laws given that coverage. If a State elects to undertake this analysis, subsection (f) signals that any list included is not exclusive.

                            Public Policy Invalidation. Contract terms may be unenforceable because of federal preemption under subsection (a) of this section or because they are unconscionable under section 111 [§ 59.1-501.11].  In addition, subsection (b) sets out the legal principle
                            that, in certain circumstances, terms may be unenforceable if they violate a fundamental public policy that clearly overrides the policy favoring enforcement of private transactions as between the parties. The principle that
                            courts may invalidate a term of a contract on public policy grounds is recognized at common law and in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 178 et. seq. See, e.g., Livingston v. Tapscott, 585 So. 2d 839 (Ala. 1991); Occidental

                    <p>
                        The transition from print to digital media has created new demands for information. Because digital information is so easily copied, increased attention has been focused on the formulation of rights in information in order to encourage its creation and
                        on the development of contracting methods that enable effective development and efficient marketing of information assets. Here, as in other parts of the economy, the fundamental policy of contract law is to enforce contractual
                        agreements. At the same time, there remains a fundamental public interest in assuring that information in the public domain is free for all to use from the public domain and in providing access to information for public purposes
                        such as education, research, and fair comment. While the digital environment increases the risk of unfair copying, the enforcement of contracts that permit owners to limit use of information and the development of technological
                        measures have given the owners of information considerable means of enforcing exclusivity in the information they produce or collect. This is true not only against those in contractual privity with the owners, but also in some
                        contexts against the world-at-large.

                        Balancing the rights of owners of information against the claims of those who want access is complex and has been the subject of considerable controversy and negotiation at both the federal level and internationally. The extent to which the resolution
                        of these issues at the federal level ought to preempt state law is beyond the scope of this Act, the central purpose of which is to facilitate private transactions in information. Moreover, it is clear that limitations on the information
                        property rights of owners that may exist in a copyright regime, where rights are good against third parties, may be inappropriate in a contractual setting where courts should be reluctant to set aside terms of a contract. Subsections
                        (a) and (b) strike the balance between fundamental interests in contract freedom and fundamental public policies such as those regarding innovation, competition, and free expression. The use of these general principles will enable
                        the courts to react to changing practices and technology; more specific prohibitions would lack flexibility and would inevitably fail to cover all relevant contingencies.

                        A contract term that varies the effect of a rule whose effect between the parties cannot be varied by agreement under the Copyright Act is unenforceable. Subsection (a) refers to preemption, but other doctrines grounded in federal law may preclude enforcement
                        of some contract terms in some cases. Except for rules that directly regulate specific contract terms, no general preemption of contracting arises under copyright or patent law. See National Car Rental System, Inc. v. Computer
                        Associates Int’l, Inc., 991 F.2d 426 (8th Cir. 1993);

                        Fundamental state policies are most commonly stated by the legislature. In the absence of a legislative declaration of a particular policy, courts should be reluctant to override a contract term. In evaluating a claim that a term violates fundamental
                        public policy, courts should consider various factors, including the extent to which enforcement or invalidation of the term will adversely affect the interests of each party to the transaction or the public, the interest in protecting
                        expectations arising from the contract, the purpose of the challenged term, the extent to which enforcement or invalidation will adversely affect other fundamental public interests, the strength and consistency of judicial decisions
                        applying similar policies in similar contexts, the nature of any express legislative or regulatory policies, and the values of certainty of enforcement and uniformity in interpreting contractual provisions. Where parties have negotiated
                        terms in their agreement, courts should be even more reluctant to set aside terms of the agreement. In applying these factors, courts should consider the position taken in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 178, comment b
                        (“Enforcement will be denied only if the factors that argue against enforcement clearly outweigh the law’s traditional interest in protecting the expectations of the parties, its abhorrence of any unjust enrichment, and any public
                        interest in enforcement of the particular term.”). In light of the national and international integration of the digital economy, courts should be reluctant to invalidate terms based on purely local policies.

                    <p>
                        The offsetting public policies most likely to apply to transactions within this Act are those relating to innovation, competition, fair comment and fair use. Innovation policy recognizes the need for a balance between protecting property interests in
                        information to encourage its creation and the importance of a rich public domain upon which most innovation ultimately depends. Competition policy prevents unreasonable restraints on publicly available information in order to protect
                        competition. Rights of free expression may include the right of persons to comment, whether positively or negatively, on the character or quality of information in the marketplace. Free expression and the public interest in supporting
                        public domain use of published information also underlie fair use as a restraint on information property rights. Fair use doctrine is established by Congress in the Copyright Act. Its application and the policy of fair use is one
                        for consideration and determination there. However, to the extent that Congress has established policies on fair use, those can taken into consideration under this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In practice, enforcing private contracts is most often consistent with these policies, largely because contracts reflect a purchased allocation of risks and benefits and define the commercial marketplace in which much information is disseminated and acquired.
                        Thus, a wide variety of contract terms restricting the use of information by one of the contracting parties present no significant concerns. For example, contract restrictions on libelous or obscene language in an on-line chat
                        room promote interests in free expression and association. Such restrictions are enforced to a much broader degree if they arise out of contractual arrangements than if they are imposed by governmental regulation. However, there
                        remains the possibility that contractual terms, particularly those arising from a context without negotiation, may be impermissible if they violate fundamental public policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contracting parties may have greater freedom contractually to restrict the use of confidential information than information that is otherwise publicly available. While a term that prohibits a person from criticizing the quality of software may raise public
                        policy concerns if included in a shrink-wrap license for software distributed in the mass market, a similar provision included in an agreement between a developer and a company applicable to experimental or early version software
                        not yet perfected for the marketplace would not raise similar concerns. Trade secret law allows information to be transferred subject to considerable contractual limitations on disclosure which facilitates the exploitation and
                        commercial application of new technology. On the other hand, trade secret law does not prohibit reverse engineering of lawfully acquired goods available on the open market. Striking the appropriate balance depends on a variety
                        of contextual factors that can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis with an eye to national policies.

                    <p>
                        A term or contract that results from an agreement between commercial parties should be presumed to be valid and a heavy burden of proof should be imposed on the party seeking to escape the terms of the agreement under subsection (b). This Act and general
                        contract law also recognize the commercial necessity of enforcing standard-form agreements mass-market transactions. The terms of such forms may not be available to the licensee prior to the payment of the price and typically are
                        not subject to affirmative negotiations. In such circumstances, courts must be more vigilant in assuring that limitations on use of the informational subject matter of the license do not offend over-riding fundamental public policy.

                    <p>
                        Even in mass-market transactions, however, limitations in a license for software or other information, such as terms that prohibit the licensee from making multiple copies, or that prohibit the licensee or others from using the information for commercial
                        purposes, or that limit the number of users authorized to access the information, or that prohibit the modification of software or informational content without the licensor’s permission are typically enforceable. See, e.g., Storm
                        Impact, Inc. v. Software of the Month Club, 13 F. Supp.2d 782 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (“no commercial use” restriction in an on-line contract). On the other hand, terms in a mass-market license that prohibit persons from observing the
                        visible operations or visible characteristics of software and using the observations to develop non-infringing commercial products, that prohibit quotation of limited material for purposes of education or criticism, or that preclude
                        a non-profit library licensee from making an archival (back-up) copy would ordinarily be invalid in the absence of a showing of significant commercial need.

                    <p>
                        Under the general principle in subsection (b), courts also may look to federal copyright and patent laws for guidance on what types of limitations on the rights of owners of information ordinarily seem appropriate, recognizing, however, that private parties
                        ordinarily have sound commercial reasons for contracting for limitations on use and that enforcing private ordering arrangements in itself reflects a fundamental public policy enacted throughout the Uniform Commercial Code and
                        common law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In part because of the transformations caused by digital information, many areas of public information policy are in flux and subject to extensive debate. In several instances these debates are conducted within the domain of copyright or patent laws,
                        such as whether copying a copyrighted work for purposes of reverse engineering is an infringement. This Act does not address these issues of national intellectual property policy, but how they are resolved may be instructive to
                        courts in applying this subsection. One national statement of policy on the relationship between reverse engineering, security testing, and copyright in digital information can be found at 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (1999). It recognizes
                        a policy not to prohibit some forms of reverse engineering and also to protect security testing where it is needed to protect the integrity and security of computers, computer systems or computer networks. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(j)(1999)
                        (“the term ‘security testing’ means accessing a computer, computer system, or computer network, solely for the purpose of good faith testing, investigating, or correcting, a security flaw or vulnerability, with the authorization
                        of the owner or operator of such computer, computer system, or computer network . . . [It] is not a violation . . . for a person to develop, produce, distribute or employ technological means for the sole purpose of performing the
                        acts of security testing”). This policy may or may not outweigh a contract term to the contrary. See Section 118 for provisions dealing with reverse engineering for purposes of interoperability and Official Comment 3 to that section.With
                        reference to contract law policies that regulate the bargain of the parties, this Act makes express public policy choices. Contract law issues such as contract formation, creation and disclaimer of warranties, measuring and limiting
                        damages, basic contractual obligations, contractual background rules, the effect of contractual choice, risk of loss, and the like, including the right of parties to alter the effect of the terms of this Act by their agreement
                        should not be invalidated under subsection (b) of this section. This subsection deals with policies that implicate the broader public interest and the balance between enforcing private transactions and the need to protect the public
                        domain of information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court, if it finds a particular term unenforceable under this section, may enforce the remainder of the contract if it is possible to do so. In considering this issue the court should consider the factors described in Restatement (Second) of Contracts
                        § 184.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under this provision there are cases where a party can validly, by contract, agree not to comment about, use, or disclose information except as provided by agreement. Nondisclosure and no-discussion terms may be important for trade secrecy, trademark,
                        unfair competition and other law. Enforcing such terms is central to establishing and retaining valuable rights and provides a foundation for much of modern practice involving technology. This subsection does not disturb such contracting
                        practices, including practices that contractually restrict disclosure or comment. It does not apply unless the information is made generally available; thus, it would not apply to ordinary trade secret and limited distribution
                        transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The policy behind this subsection is this: if the person that owns or controls rights in the information decides that it is ready for general distribution to the public, the decision to place it in the general stream of commerce places it into an arena
                        in which persons who use the product have a strong public interest in public discussion about it. This subsection recognizes that those public interests outweigh interests in enforcing the contract term in appropriate cases. It
                        thus applies only if there was an authorized distribution in final form. “Final form” does not include distribution of pre-test or so-called “beta” or other test versions, such as where the intent of the distribution is to collect
                        information to make further improvements and nondisclosure rules are important to obtaining feedback without exposing the potential product to premature public discussion and criticism. Once generally released in final form, however,
                        a product does not lose that character simply because further versions of it may be developed and released in the future. A product is in final form for purposes of this section when it has been generally released in the marketplace.
                        “End-user licensee” reflects the intent of this subsection not to disturb relationships between manufacturers and distributors where application of such a rule could have unintended consequences. In cases where the license involves
                        a company or other legal entity, the term includes the named entity and any individuals authorized to use the computer information under that license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A closer question exists if a party makes software available subject to limits on its use which may or may not be interpreted as involving contractual obligations. This Act does not take a position on whether or not intellectual property notices in any
                        particular context are contractual in nature. This Act does not apply to non-contractual relationships. The effect of an intellectual property notice that is not part of a contract is governed by other law and this Act takes no
                        position on what that law is or its effect.

                            Scope of the Section. This section brings together rules regarding construction and application of this Act.
                        </li>

                            Purpose of the Act. This Act must be construed in light of its purposes. As stated in paragraph (1), these are not regulatory, but are intended to facilitate and support commercial practice and to support its evolution through agreement and trade practices.
                            To construe an Act in light of its purposes does not mean that general purposes supplant specific provisions.  However, in cases of uncertainty, the meaning of this Act should be construed by reference to the stated purposes
                            and the themes developed in the Act, as opposed to inconsistent or extraneous contract law policies that contradict those of this Act.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a01s59.1-501.6-officialcomment.1ol13">
                            Mandatory Language. This Act ordinarily does not use phrases such as “unless otherwise agreed” and frequently uses mandatory language such as “shall” or “must.” However, neither drafting style alters the basic rule that the agreement controls in all cases,
                            except as indicated in Section 115(b) [§ 59.1-501.15(b)]. Paragraph (2) rejects decisions such as Suburban Trust and Savings Bank v. The University of Delaware, 910 F. Supp. 1009 (D. Del. 1995) (absence of language allowing
                            variance by agreement indicates provision is mandatory). The agreement, including trade usage and the like, also controls the meaning of language parties use in their contract. For example, an agreement may state that a party
                            may “terminate” for breach.  The Uniform Commercial Code and this Act define “termination” as ending a contract without breach.  The proper interpretation of the agreement is based on its context and whether use of the term
                            corresponds to a cancellation or termination under this Act.
                        </li>

                            Negative Inference. Paragraph (3) resolves issues about the existence of a negative pregnant.  In this Act, the statement of an affirmative result that occurs when certain conditions are met does not necessarily indicate that a different result occurs
                            if the conditions are not met.  Thus, if a provision states: “If the originator of a message requests acknowledgment, the following rules apply: —-”, this does not indicate what rule governs in the absence of a request. Similarly,
                            a provision that states that particular language or procedure yields a specific result does not indicate what result occurs with different language or procedures.  It merely states the affirmative proposition.  If a different
                            interpretation is intended, that different interpretation is made explicit in the section.

                            Scope of Section. This section states that statutes pertaining to subject matter within this Act requiring a “writing” or “signature” must be interpreted and applied as allowing a “record” or “authentication.” The rules apply only to transactions within
                            this Act, whether by agreement or otherwise.

                            Equivalence of Electronics. Under subsection (a), the fact that a message, record or authentication is electronic does not alter its legal impact.  This establishes an equivalence between electronic and other records.  The rule refers to the form of the
                            authentication or record, not to its content.  See Section 104(4) [§ 59.1-501.4:1(d)]. Subsection (a) does not address how to prove attribution or authentication, nor does it alter evidence law relating to when an original
                            copy of a record is required or what, in a digital world, constitutes an original.

                            Requiring Electronics. Nothing in this Act requires parties to use electronic processes. Subsection (b). In some cases, parties may wish to require use of paper documents; this Act does not alter that choice. It merely establishes a legal framework for
                            electronic commerce in which electronics and paper records are equivalent in law. Parties may decide to use, or not to use, that framework.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a01s59.1-501.7-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Establishing requirements. Subsection (c) makes clear that parties can set their own requirements regarding the acceptability of records or authentication. This does not authorize one party unilaterally to change requirements previously established by
                            agreement. Also, subsection (c) does not require that the parties establish requirements regarding electronics — it simply clarifies that they may if they so choose. A person can insist on conformance with requirements that
                            are offered or agreed. Thus, while typing one’s name with the requisite intent may be an authentication under this Act, parties can require a different form of authentication, such as a digital signature using encryption. Nothing
                            in this Act disturbs their ability to so contract. Ordinary standards of waiver, estoppel and the like, along with general rules of offer and acceptance, provide standards for dealing with issues that might arise in this context.

                            Electronic Agents. Operations of an electronic agent generally bind the party that used the electronic agent for that purpose. Subsection (d). This rule is limited to situations where the party selects the agent, and includes cases where the party consciously
                            elects to employ the agent on its own behalf, whether that agent was created by it, licensed from another, or otherwise adopted for this purpose. The term “selects” does not require a choice from among several electronic agents,
                            but merely a conscious decision to use a particular agent.

                        The concept here embodies principles like those in agency law, but it does not depend on agency law. The electronic agent must be operating within its intended purpose. For human agents, this is often described as acting within the scope of authority.
                        Here, the focus is on whether the agent was used for the relevant purpose. For a similar concept in a different context, see Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Webbworld, Inc., 991 F. Supp. 543 (N.D. Tex. 1997), aff’d, 168 F.3d 486 (5th
                        Cir. 1999). Cases of fraud, manipulation and the like are discussed in Section 206 [§ 59.1-502.6].

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with agreed terms selecting applicable law and with what law applies to a transaction in the absence of agreed terms. Subsection (a) enforces the agreement except with respect to mandatory consumer protection rules.
                            Subsections (b) and (c) provides clarity on what law applies in the absence of an enforceable contract term.

                            Contractual Choice of Law. Contract terms that select the law applicable to the contract are routine in commercial agreements. The information economy accentuates their importance because it allows remote parties to enter and perform contracts spanning
                            multiple jurisdictions and in circumstances that do not depend on physical location of either party or the information. Subsection (a) enables small companies to actively engage in multinational business; if the agreement could
                            not designate applicable law, even the smallest business would be subject to the law of all fifty states and all countries in the world. That would impose large costs and uncertainty on an otherwise efficient system of commerce;
                            it would create barriers to entry.

                                    General Rule. This Act enforces agreed choices of law. This follows most decisions dealing with information-related contracts. See Medtronic Inc. v. Janss, 729 F.2d 1395 (11th Cir. 1984); Northeast Data Sys., Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Computer Sys. Co.,
                                    986 F.2d 607 (1st Cir. 1993). Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188 has a similar rule. Subsection (a) does not follow U.C.C. § 1-105 (1998 Official Text) which requires that the selected state have a “reasonable
                                    relationship” to the transaction. In a global information economy, limitations of that type are inappropriate, especially in cyberspace where physical locations are often irrelevant or not knowable. Parties may appropriately
                                    wish to select a neutral forum because neither is familiar with the law of the other’s jurisdiction. In such a case, the chosen state’s law may have no relationship at all to the transaction. See White House Report,
                                    A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce, July 1, 1997. This rule is consistent with international norms. See Inter-American Convention on the Law Applicable to International Contracts art. 7 (Mexico City 1994); Convention
                                    on the Law Applicable to Contracts for the International Sale of Goods art. 7(1) (The Hague 1986).

                                    Limitations. Agreed choices of law are subject to limitations such as in the doctrine of unconscionability and the treatment of overriding fundamental public policy of the forum state. Section 105(b) [§ 59.1-501.5(b)]; Application Group, Inc. v. Hunter

                            Choice of Law: No Contract term. Subsection (b) states what choice-of-law rules govern in the absence of a contract term. These rules apply to all contract-related issues and replace common law. Contracts in computer information can be created and performed
                            remotely, a factor emphasizing the need for tailored, understandable rules that enhance certainty and thus facilitate commerce. As to common law, see William Richman &amp; William Reynolds, Understanding Conflict of Laws 241
                            (2d ed. 1992) (“[C]hoice-of-law theory today is in considerable disarray. [It] is marked by eclecticism and even eccentricity.”).

                            Most Significant Relationship. In the absence of an agreement and except for the rules in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), subsection (b)(3) adopts a “most significant relationship” test. The Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law uses a similar test;
                            cases interpreting that rule are applicable here. Applying this test requires consideration of factors including the: (a) place of contracting, (b) place of negotiation, (c) place of performance, (d) location of the subject
                            matter of the contract, (e) domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of one or both parties, (f) needs of the interstate and international systems, (g) relative interests of the forum and
                            other interested states in the determination of the particular issue, (h) protection of justified expectations of the parties, and (i) promotion of certainty, predictability and uniformity of result.

                            Foreign Countries. Subsection (c) does not apply if an enforceable contract term designates what law applies. It deals with cases where the default rules in subsection (b) select the law of a foreign country whose law is substantively inappropriate because
                            it fails to give a party protections substantially similar to those available under this Act. The reference is solely to contract law, including this Act and general contract and related equity law of the jurisdiction. Subsection
                            (c) allows a court to use a different choice of law rule than in (b), but courts should alter the basic rule only in extreme cases. It does not suffice merely that the foreign law is different. The differences must be substantial
                            and adverse.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) further provides that, in a consumer contract, the agreed choice of law cannot override an otherwise applicable rule that could not be altered by agreement under the law of the state whose law would apply in the absence of the contractual
                        choice. The policy of freedom of contract should not permit overriding the consumer rule if a state, having addressed the cost and benefits, determines that the consumer rule is not variable by contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b)(1) specifies that, in an access contract or a contract involving electronic delivery of information, in the absence of an agreed choice of law, the agreement is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the licensor is located. Any
                        other rule would require that the information provider (small or large) comply with the law of all states and all countries, since it may not be known or knowable where the contract is formed or the information sent. The rule adopted
                        here enhances certainty in a context where an on-line vendor, large or small, makes Internet access available to the entire world. “Located” is defined in subsection (d) and does not depend on the location of the computer that
                        contains the information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b)(2) applies to consumer transactions that involve delivery of tangible (physical) copies. In the absence of agreed terms, the law where the copy is or was to be delivered governs. Thus, if a consumer is to receive delivery of a tangible
                        copy in Chicago, the transaction is subject to the law of Illinois unless the agreement indicates otherwise. This is consistent with current U.S. law and is followed in many European countries. It adopts, for the consumer, the
                        location that is most likely to be consistent with the consumer’s expectations. It avoids surprise to the provider because the tangible copy is to be delivered into a known state.

                            General Rule. Choice of forum agreements are generally enforceable. This rule adopts the approach of Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1972), and cases following that decision, which form the majority position
                            on this issue in this country, and which treat choice of forum terms as presumptively valid. The Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law has a similar rule.

                            Limitations. A choice of an exclusive forum is not enforceable if it is unreasonable or unjust; the term also is not enforceable if it is unconscionable under Section 111 [§ 59.1-501.11]. The “unreasonable or unjust” standard follows Breman and its progeny
                            and adopts the reasoning of those cases, also applying the standard to choice of arbitral forums. The agreed term is unenforceable if it has no valid commercial purpose and has a severe and unfair impact on the other party.
                            In such cases, the choice is both unreasonable and unjust. This may preclude enforcement of forum agreements that choose an unreasonable forum solely to defeat the other party’s ability to contest disputes. Terms may be unreasonable
                            in that they have no commercial purpose or justification other than to defeat the rights of the other party and their impact may be unjust if the term unfairly harms the other party for no sustainable reason. On the other hand,
                            an agreed choice of forum based on a valid commercial purpose is not invalid simply because it adversely affects one party, even if bargaining power was unequal. The burden of establishing that the clause fails lies with the
                            party asserting its invalidity. Bremen v. Zapata Offshore Co., 407 U.S. 1 (1972); Pelleport Investors, Inc. v. Budco Quality Theaters, Inc., 741 F.2d 273 (9th Cir. 1984); Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Law § 80, comment
                            c (1989 rev.). A party that challenges a choice of forum clause by filing in a forum other than the designated forum does not breach the contract by doing so.

                            Non-exclusive Forum. Subsection (b) provides that a choice of forum term is nonexclusive unless the agreement expressly provides otherwise. Requiring express exclusivity terms provides notice and follows what, in most cases, is the expectation of the
                            parties. The enforceability of a non-exclusive forum selection clause is not addressed in this Act. Absent unconscionability or other overriding restriction, these clauses present less reason for restricting contract choices
                            than do the clauses dealt with in this section.

                            Forum for Decision. Subsection (c) clarifies the general rule that the enforceability of the forum selection clause will be determined by the forum in which the action is brought. The subsection refers to a decision by a court. In this Act, that term
                            includes an arbitral forum. Thus, this section does not resolve the issue of whether the determination is to be made by a court or an arbitral panel. The forum must be of competent jurisdiction. The subsection does not disturb
                            existing law that determines whether a challenge to a forum selection should be heard by an arbitrator or by a judicial officer. If the action is brought by a consumer in his jurisdiction or if enforcement of a judgment is
                            challenged by the consumer in its jurisdiction,then the consumer’s jurisdiction will decide the questions of enforceability of the forum selection clause.

                        Agreed choices of forum are important in electronic commerce. Court decisions on jurisdiction in the Internet demonstrate the uncertainty about when merely doing business on the Internet exposes a party to jurisdiction in all States and all countries.
                        That uncertainty affects all businesses, but it has greatest impact on small enterprises. Choice of forum agreements serve a significant commercial purpose by allowing parties to control the uncertainty and the cost it creates.

                            Basic Policy and Effect. This section and Section 117 [§ 59.1-501.17] allow courts to rule directly on the unconscionability of the contract or a particular term. The basic test is whether, in light of the general commercial background and the commercial
                            needs of the particular trade or case, the terms involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made. The principle is one of the prevention of oppression and
                            unfair surprise and not of disturbance of allocation of risks because of superior bargaining power. See Intel Corp. v. Integraph, 195 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Since its adoption in Article 2 of the U.C.C., the doctrine of
                            unconscionability has received continuing attention from the courts and enables courts to police explicitly against the contracts or clauses which they find to be unconscionable. See, Brower v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 676 N.Y.S.2d
                            569 (N.Y.A.D. 1998). In this Act, the concept requiring an ‘opportunity to review’ establishes a requirement that is not clearly present in common law and that resolves many procedural issues preventing unfair surprise. Section
                            113 [§ 59.1-501.13:1], cmt. 2.

                            Electronic commerce. This Act confirms the enforceability of automated contracting involving “electronic agents,” but in some cases automation may produce unexpected, potentially oppressive results due to errors in programs, problems in communication,
                            or other unforeseen circumstances in the automation process. Common law concepts of mistake may apply, as may Sections 206 and 213 [§§ 59.1-502.6 and 59.1-502.14]. In addition, in appropriate cases, unconscionability doctrine
                            may invalidate a term because a procedural breakdown in automated contract formation produces unexpected and oppressive results in the terms of the agreement.

                            Remedy. The court, in its discretion, may refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is permeated by the unconscionability, or it may strike any single term or group of terms that are so tainted, or it may simply limit unconscionable clauses so as
                            to avoid unconscionable results.

                            Decision of the court. Unconscionability is a decision to be made by the court. The commercial evidence allowed under subsection (b) is for the court’s consideration, not for the jury. Only the terms of the agreement that result from the court’s action
                            are submitted to the general triers of fact for resolution of a matter in dispute.

                            Scope of Section. This section provides standards for “manifestation of assent.” Section 113 [§ 59.1-501.13:1] deals with the related, important concept of an “opportunity to review”. In this Act, having an opportunity to review a record is a precondition
                            to manifesting assent.

                            General Theme. The term “manifesting assent” comes from Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19. This section corresponds to Restatement § 19 but more fully explicates the concept.  Codification establishes uniformity that is lacking in common law.

                                    Assent by Statements or Authentication. A person can assent to a record or term by stating or otherwise indicating its assent or by “authenticating” the record or term.  Authentication occurs if a party signs a record or does an electronic equivalent.
                                    Section 102 (a)(6) [§ 59.1-501.2 (a)(6)].

                                    Assent by Conduct. Assent occurs if a person acts or fails to act having reason to know its behavior will be viewed by the other party as indicating assent. Whether this occurs depends on the circumstances. As in common law, proof of assent does not require
                                    proof of a person’s subjective intent or purpose, but focuses on objective indicia, including whether there was an act or a failure to act voluntarily engaged in with reason to know that an inference of assent would
                                    be drawn.  Actions objectively indicating assent are assent. This follows  modern contract law doctrines of objective assent.  Doctrines of mistake, fraud, and duress apply in appropriate cases.

                                    Assent by Electronic Agents. Assent may occur through automated systems (“electronic agents”). Either or both parties (including consumers) may use electronic agents. For electronic agents, assent cannot be based on knowledge or reason to know, since
                                    computer programs are capable of neither and the automated nature of the interaction may mean that no individual is aware of it.  Subsection (b) focuses on the electronic agent’s acts, not knowledge, or reason to know.
                                    Assent occurs if the agent’s operations were an authentication or if, in the circumstances, the operations indicate assent. In this Act, manifesting assent requires a prior opportunity to review. For an electronic agent,
                                    this opportunity occurs only if the record or term was presented in such a way that a reasonably configured electronic agent could react to it. See Section 113(b) [§ 59.1-501.13:1].  The capability of an automated system
                                    to react and an assessment of the implications of its actions are the only appropriate measures of assent.

                                    Assent to Particular Terms. This Act distinguishes between assent to a record and, when required by this Act or other law, assent to a particular term in a record.  Assent to a record encompasses all terms of the record.  Section 208 [§ 59.1-502.8].
                                    Assent to a particular term, if required, requires acts that specifically relate to that term.  This is like a requirement that a party “initial” a clause to make it effective.  One act, however, may assent to both
                                    the record and the term if the circumstances, including the language of the record, clearly indicate that this is true, such as where assent is clearly indicated as being to the record and to a term the nature of which
                                    is made clear to the assenting party.

                            Terms of Agreement. Manifestation of assent to a record is not the only way in which parties establish the terms of their agreement.  This Act does not alter recognition in law of other methods of agreeing to terms.  For example, a product description
                            can become part of an agreement without manifestation of assent to a record repeating that description; the product description defines the bargain itself.  A party that licenses a database of names of “consumer attorneys”
                            need only provide a database of consumer attorneys since this is the bargain; the provider is not required to obtain assent to a record stating that deal. Similarly, the licensee can rely on the fact that the database must
                            contain consumer attorneys, not other lawyers. If a product is clearly identified on the package or in representations to the licensee as for consumer use only, that term is effective without language in a record restating
                            the description or conduct assenting to that record.  Of course, if the nature of the product is not obvious and there is no assent or agreement to terms defining it, hidden conditions might not be part of the agreement.

                            Proof of Assent. Many different acts can establish assent to a contract or a contract term.  It is not possible to state them in a statute.  In electronic commerce, one important method is by showing that a procedure existed that required an authentication
                            or other assent in order to proceed in an automated system.  This is recognized in subsection (d).

                            Authority to Act. The person manifesting assent must be one that can bind the party seeking the benefits or being charged with the obligations or restrictions of the agreement.  In general, this Act treats this issue as a question of attribution: are
                            the assent-producing acts attributable to this particular person?  A person that desires to enforce terms against another must establish that it dealt with an individual or agent that had authority to bind the person or, at
                            least, establish that the person to be bound accepted the benefits of the contract or otherwise ratified the acts.  If the individual who assented did not have authority and the conduct was not ratified or otherwise adopted,
                            there may be no assent as to the party “represented,” but only as to the individual who acted. If this occurs, both the purported principal and the relying party may be at risk: the relying party (e.g., licensor) risks loss
                            of its terms with respect to the party it intended to have bound, while the purported principal (“licensee” using information not obtained by a proper agent) risks that use of the computer information infringes a copyright
                            or patent, since the principal does not have the benefit of the license. There must be an adequate connection between the individual who had the opportunity to review and the one whose acts constitute assent.  Of course, a
                            party with authority can delegate that authority to another and such delegation may be either express or implicit.  Thus, a CEO may authorize her secretary to agree to a license when the CEO instructs the secretary to sign
                            up for legal materials online or to install a newly acquired program that is subject to an on-screen license.

                            Modification of Rules. Subsection (e) recognizes that parties, by prior agreement, may define what constitutes assent with respect to future conduct in ongoing relationships. Compare Section 113(e). The parties may call for more or less formality than
                            set out in this Act. This is important for cases where multiple transfers in electronic commerce occur pursuant to prior agreement. Assent in such cases can just as well be found in the original agreement as in the subsequent
                            conduct.

                            Third Party Service Providers. Assent requires conduct by the party to be bound or its agents.  If the party is enabled to reach a system because of services provided by a third party communications or service provider, the service provider typically
                            does not intend or enter into in a contractual relationship with the provider of the information. While the customer’s acts may constitute assent by the customer, they do not bind the service provider since the service provider’s
                            actions are in the nature of transmissions and enabling access, not assent to a contractual relationship.

                    <p>
                        Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19(1) provides: ‘The manifestation of assent may be made wholly or partly by written or spoken words or by other acts or by failure to act.‘ This section adopts that view. Conduct can convey assent as clearly as words.
                        This rule is important in electronic commerce, where most interactions involve conduct rather than words. Subsection (b) adapts that principle to electronic agent contracting.

                    <p>
                        “Manifesting assent” has several roles: 1) a method by which a party agrees to a contract; 2) a method by which a party adopts terms of a record as the terms of a contract; and 3) if required by this Act, a means of assenting to a particular term. In
                        most cases, the same act accomplishes the results under 1 and 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Manifesting assent does not require any specific formality of language or conduct. In this Act, however, to manifest assent to a record or term requires meeting three conditions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •
                        <span class="s2">
        First
       </span> , the person must have knowledge of the record or term or an opportunity to review it before assenting. An opportunity to review requires that the record be made available in a manner that ought to call it to the
                        attention of a reasonable person and that readily permits review. Subsection 113 may also require a right of return if the opportunity to review comes after a person becomes obligated to pay or begins performance.
                    </p>

                        <span class="s2">
        Second
       </span> , having had an opportunity to review, the person must manifest assent. The person may authenticate the record or term, express assent verbally, or intentionally engage in conduct with reason to know that the conduct
                        indicates assent. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19. As in the
                        <i>
        Restatement
       </i> this can include a failure to action if the circumstances so indicate.

                        •
                        <span class="s2">
        Third
       </span> , the conduct, statement, or authentication must be attributable in law to the person. General agency law and Section 212 [§ 59.1-502.13] provide standards for attribution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Assent does not require that a party be able to negotiate or modify terms, but the assenting behavior must be intentional (voluntary). This same rule prevails in all other contract law. Intentional conduct is satisfied if the alternative of refusing to
                        act exists, even if refusing leaves no alternative source for the computer information. On the other hand, conduct is not assent if it is conduct which the assenting party cannot avoid doing, such as blinking one’s eyes. Courts
                        use common sense in applying this standard in common law and will do so under this Act. Actions in a context of a mutual reservation of the right to defer agreement to a contract do not manifest assent; neither party has any reason
                        to believe that its conduct will suggest assent to the other party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge that conduct or inaction is assent satisfies this rule. Also, conduct is assent if a person has “reason to know” the conduct will lead the other party to believe that there was assent. Factors that relate to this issue include: the ordinary
                        expectations of similar persons in similar contexts; language on a display, package, or otherwise made available to the party; the fact that the party can decline and return the information, but decides to use it; information communicated
                        before the conduct occurred; and standards and practices of the business, trade or industry of which the person has reason to know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “reason to know” standard is not met if the computer information is sent to a recipient unsolicited under terms that purport to create a binding contract by failure to object to the unsolicited sending. In such cases, it is not reasonable for the
                        sending party to infer assent from silence; the threshold for manifesting assent is not met.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, copyright or other intellectual property notices restrict use of a product without needing assent to contract terms. For example, a video rental may place a notice on screen that limits the customer’s use such as by precluding commercial public
                        performances. Enforceability of such notices does not depend on obtaining a manifestation of assent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (d) also encourages use of double assent procedures as a reconfirmation showing intentional assent (“intentionally engages in conduct . . . with reason to know”). It makes clear that if the assenting party has an opportunity to confirm or deny
                        assent before proceeding to obtain or use information, confirmation meets the requirement of subsection (a)(2). This does not alter the effectiveness of a single indication of assent. When properly set out with an opportunity to
                        review terms and to make clear that an act such as clicking assent on-screen is assent, a single indication of assent suffices. See Caspi v. Microsoft Network, L.L.C., 323 N.J.Super. 118, 732 A.2d 528 (N.J.A.D. 1999), cert. den.,

       </b> The first screen of an online stock-quote service requires that the potential licensee enter its name, address and credit card number. After entering the information and striking the “enter” key, the licensee has access
                        to the data and receives a monthly bill. Somewhere below the place to enter the information, but hidden in small print, is the statement: “Terms and conditions of service; disclaimers.” The customer’s attention is not called to
                        this sentence, nor is the customer asked to react to it. Even though using the service creates a contract, there may be no assent to the terms of service and disclaimer, since there is no act indicating assent to those terms. If
                        there is no assent to those terms, the court would determine contract terms on other grounds, including the rules of this Act and usage of trade.

                    <p>
                        Questions of this sort arise under agency law as augmented in this Act, such as by the provision on electronic agents in Section 211 [§ 59.1-502.12] or rules in this Act on attribution. Other law governs questions of ordinary agency law, estoppel and
                        the like.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (f) makes clear that service providers — providers of online services, network access, or the operation of facilities thereof — do not manifest assent to a contractual relationship simply from their provision of such services, including but
                        not limited to transmission, routing, providing connections, or linking or storage of material at the request or initiation of a person other than the service provider. If, for example, a telecommunications company provided the
                        routing for a user to reach a particular online location, the fact that the user of the service might assent to a contract at that location does not mean that the service provider has done so. The conduct of the customer does not
                        bind the service provider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, in some on-line systems the service provider has direct contractual relationships with the content providers or may desire access to and use the information on its own behalf, and therefore may assent to terms in order to obtain access. In
                        the absence of these circumstances, however, the mere fact that the third-party service provider enables the customer to reach the information site does not constitute assent to the terms at that site.

                            Scope of this Section. This section sets out the basic standards for when a party has been given an opportunity to review the terms of a record. Unless there is an opportunity to review the record, under Section 112 [§ 59.1-501.12] the party cannot manifest
                            assent to it.

                            Opportunity to Review. A manifestation of assent to a record or term under this Act cannot occur unless there was an opportunity to review the record or term. Common law does not clearly establish this requirement, but the requirement of an opportunity
                            to review terms reasonably made available reflects simple fairness and establishes concepts that curtail procedural aspects of unconscionability. Section 111 [§ 59.1-501.11]. For a person, an opportunity to review requires
                            that a record be made available in a manner that ought to call it to the attention of a reasonable person and permit review. See Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., — F.3d —, 2002 WL 31166784 n. 13 (Fed. Cir. 2002). This
                            requirement is met if the person knows of the record or has reason to know that the record or term exists in a form and location that in the circumstances permit review of it or a copy of it. For an electronic agent, an opportunity
                            to review exists only if the record is one to which a reasonably configured electronic agent could respond. Terms made available for review during an over-the-counter transaction or otherwise in a manner required under federal
                            law give an opportunity to review.

                                    Declining to Use the Opportunity to Review. An opportunity to review does not require that the person use that opportunity. The condition is met even if the person does not read or actually review the record. This is not changed because the party desires
                                    to complete the transaction rapidly, is under pressure to do so, or because the party has other demands on its attention, unless the one party actively manipulates circumstances to induce the other party not to review
                                    the record. Such manipulation may vitiate the alleged opportunity to review.

                                    Permits Review. How a record is made available for review may differ for electronic and paper records. In both, however, a record is not available for review if access to it is so time-consuming or cumbersome, or if its presentation is so obscure or oblique,
                                    as to make it difficult to review. It must be presented in a way as to reasonably permit review. In an electronic system, a record promptly accessible through an electronic link ordinarily qualifies. Actions that comply
                                    with federal or other applicable consumer laws that require making contract terms or disclosure available, or that provide standards for doing so, satisfy this requirement.

                                    Right to Return. If terms in a record are not available until after there is an initial commitment to the transaction, subsection (c) indicates that ordinarily there is no opportunity to review unless the party can return the product (or for a vendor
                                    that refuses the other party’s terms, recover the product) and receive appropriate reimbursement of payments if it rejects the terms. The return right creates a situation where meaningful assent can occur. The right
                                    exists only for the first licensee. If the right to a return is created only by agreement or by an offer from the one party, rather than by law, the right must be communicated to the other person so that the person
                                    ought to become aware of it.

                            Modifications and Layered Contracting. The right to a return provisions do not apply to proposals to modify an agreement or to cases where the agreement gives a party the right to specify particulars of performance. If the contract allows one party unilaterally
                            to alter terms, no further agreement is required for the changed terms to be effective if the term is not unconscionable or otherwise made invalid. If that contractual right does not exist, however, and one party proposes in
                            a record modifications of the contract (that can become effective only on the other person’s agreement to them), there must be an opportunity to review the terms before a manifestation of assent pursuant to Section 112.

                            Modification of Rules. Subsection (e) allows parties, by prior agreement, to define what constitutes assent with respect to future conduct in ongoing relationships. The parties may call for more or less formality than set out in this Act. This is important
                            for cases where multiple transfers in electronic commerce occur pursuant to prior agreement. Assent in such cases can just as well be found in the original agreement as in the subsequent conduct.

                        Computer information is frequently distributed without charge for the purpose of enabling the recipient to enter into transactions with the licensor. The “beginning of performance” under subsection (c) in such cases is typically not payment, but selection
                        of a password or other attribution procedure or the initiation of a transaction. In such situations, with respect to a right of return, the licensor’s obligation is satisfied if it provides instructions on request for destruction
                        or return of the information and, when applicable under Section 209 [§ 59.1-502.9], reimburses the other party for costs, if any. Although the party refusing terms has a reasonable time within which to contact the licensor and
                        destroy the information, it must do so before it uses the information to select a security procedure or initiate a transaction.

                        There is no distinction between software distributed at a nominal price and software that is competitively priced. Therefore, if a financial or other institution distributes software at a nominal price that enables a customer to manage its personal finances
                        or to engage in transactions with the distributor of the software, it must offer the right of return in the same manner as a company that distributes such at a market price.

                    <p>
                        The return right provides incentive for a licensor to make the terms of the license available up-front if commercially practicable since this avoids the right of return in this section and in Sections 209 and 613 [§§ 59.1-502.9 and 59.1-506.12]. An additional
                        incentive, under Sections 208 and 209 [§§ 59.1-502.8 and 59.1-502.9], is that, when presentation of terms is deferred, the terms cannot become part of the contract unless the other party had reason to know that terms would be presented
                        later. A decision to delay presentation of terms without an important commercial reason to do so may result in substantial costs and uncertainty.

                    <p>
                        Failure to provide a right to return when required does not invalidate the agreement, but creates a risk that the terms will not be assented to by the party to which they were presented. If there is no manifestation of assent to a record, the terms of
                        the agreement are determined by considering all the circumstances, including the expectations of the parties, applicable usage of trade and course of dealing, and the property rights, if any, involved in the transaction. In such
                        cases, courts should be careful to avoid unwarranted forfeiture or unjust enrichment. An agreement with payment and other agreed terms that reflect a right to use information for consumer purposes only cannot be transformed into
                        an unlimited right of commercial use by a failure of assent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, the return right does not apply where parties begin performance in the expectation that a record containing contract terms will be presented and adopted later and the performance is more than merely tendering and accepting an existing copy
                        of computer information. Subsection (c). This is common in software development and other complex contracts; this Act does not disturb that commercial practice.

                    This section applies to a licensor that makes its computer information available to a licensee by electronic means from its Internet or similar electronic site. In such a case, the licensor affords an opportunity to review the terms of a standard form
                    license, which opportunity satisfies § 59.1-501.13:1 with respect to a licensee that acquires the information from that site, if the licensor:

                            Relation to Other Assent Rules. This section provides guidance for Internet commerce and an incentive for use of particular types of disclosures of terms and acts as an incentive-creating, safe harbor rule. The section does not foreclose use of other
                            procedures. Failure to comply with this section does not bear on whether a license is enforceable or whether the procedures used adequately establish an opportunity to review. Whether an opportunity to review has occurred is
                            determined under the general standards in Section 113.

                            Disclosure and Downloading. The disclosure rules in this section are modeled the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. They combine actual disclosure with availability of terms. It is sufficient that standard terms be available on request. Terms might be
                            made available by hyperlink on the particular site or through providing a potential licensee with an address (electronic or otherwise) from which the terms can be obtained. The terms to be made available are the standard terms
                            of a license of the type involved. Supplying the terms can meet the requirements for providing an opportunity to review if the provisions of this section are met.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The terms or a reference to them must be in a prominent place in the site or in close proximity to the computer information or instructions for obtaining it. The intent of the close proximity standard is that the terms or the reference to them would be
                        called to the attention of an ordinary reasonable person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given all other conditions being satisfied, this section is met if the licensor does not take affirmative steps to preclude printing or storage of the terms of the agreement. This does not require that the licensor adopt technologies that enable downloading
                        or printing, although many technologies allow this. It does require that there be nothing affirmatively done to preclude use of one of those alternatives. For example, a licensor that uses a technology which would otherwise enable
                        copying the contract terms and modifies it specifically to preclude copying does not qualify under the provisions of this section. However, one method of compliance is sufficient: if the terms include sensitive information that
                        is more susceptible to unauthorized distribution if made available in electronic form, the licensor may preclude electronic copies. As long as it does not also preclude the ability to print a paper copy, this section is still satisfied.
                        If the licensor links the person to another location under the control of a third party, knowing that affirmative steps will be taken at that location to prevent downloading or printing, there is no compliance with this section.

                            Contract Choice. The fundamental policy of this Act is freedom of contract. Subsection (a). See also Uniform Commercial Code § 1-102(3), Official Comment 2 (1998 Official Text). With few exceptions, the parties’ agreement controls; the effect of provisions
                            of this Act may be varied by agreement unless the provision is expressly non-variable. This reflects fundamental contract law theory in a free market economy. The absence of the phrase “unless otherwise agreed” or similar language
                            in any provision of this Act does not change this principle.

                            Gap-filler Rules. With exceptions stated here, all rules in this Act are “default” or “gap-filler” rules that apply only in the absence of contrary agreement. This is especially important for converging industries and richly diverse commercial practice.
                            Agreed terms that alter default rules do not require specific reference to the default rule and ordinarily do not require use of specific language, presentation or assent, unless expressly so required by this Act. In some situations,
                            this Act expressly imposes a requirement such as that a term be conspicuous or that there be assent to the term. Such requirements exist only if expressly set forth in this Act or in consumer protection statutes. Section 104
                            [§ 59.1-501.4:1].

                        “Agreement” that varies the effect of a provision of this Act does not require express terms in a record; “agreement” refers to the bargain of the parties in fact and can be found in express terms as well as in course of dealing, course of performance,
                        and usage of trade. To be enforceable, an agreement must satisfy Section 201 [§ 59.1-502.1]. Of course, the agreement must be between the parties to which the provision applies. Several provisions of this Act allow a financier
                        to finance a licensee subject to restrictions that protect rights of the licensor. An agreement between the licensee and financier cannot alter the licensor’s rights. An agreement between the financier and the licensor cannot alter
                        rights of the licensee.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) lists rules that override express agreement to the contrary. In each case, the policy is that the provision enacts rules that should not be altered except as indicated in those sections. Beyond this list, all other rules can be varied by
                        agreement. Paragraph (b)(1) follows U.C.C. § 1-102(3) (1998 Official Text) and precludes complete waivers of good faith and other stated requirements, but allows parties by agreement to establish standards for performance of the
                        obligation. Paragraph (b)(2) recognizes that unconscionability doctrine and the doctrine in Section 105(b) [§ 59.1-501.5] trump contrary agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Listed exceptions to the rule that agreements govern should be sparingly applied. For example, subparagraph (b)(3)(C) prohibits variation of certain aspects of manifest assent and opportunity to review. That is designed to protect persons who are asked
                        to manifest assent. However, parties can agree to greater protections and, in appropriate cases, to
                        <i>
        lesser
       </i> assent standards with respect to future transactions. Section 112(e).

                            Supplemental Rules. Under subsection (a), common law rules to apply to transactions under this Act unless displaced by a provision or policy of this Act. The displacing effect of this Act with respect to common law is found not only in particular provisions
                            of the Act, but also more generally in the policies adopted in the Act. Ordinarily, the appropriate source of supplemental law should be common law, rather than statutes addressing subject matter different from that in this
                            Act. Supplementation does not mean that a common law rule overrides rules or policies in this Act, such as a policy that requires, or does not require, a particular formality or express agreement for a particular contractual

        </cite> (1998 Official Text), but this Act adopts a broader definition of “good faith.” See U.C.C. § 2-103(1)(b) (1998 Official Text); U.C.C. § 3-103(a)(4) (1998 Official Text). Good faith is relevant to the performance
                            of all contracts within the scope of this Act. Good faith is defined in Section 102.

                            Usage of Trade, etc. There are two ideas in subsection (c).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The list in subsection (a) is illustrative; no listing could be exhaustive. There are many broadly applicable competition, tax, regulatory, and property laws with which this Act does not deal since it is concerned with contract law. As made clear in subsection
                        (a), trade secret law and unfair competition law are not displaced by this Act, but supplement it pursuant to the first sentence of the subsection. Thus, if trade secret or competition law renders enforcement of a contract or a
                        contract term invalid under that law, this Act does not alter that result. A similar rule is adopted for consumer protection statutes in Section 105 [§ 59.1-501.5].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last sentence in subsection (a) makes clear several important bodies of statutory or common law that are not displaced by the Act. Thus, trade secret laws, unfair competition laws, and the law of fraud, misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive
                        practices remain fully in effect and are not displaced. To the extent applicable under that body of law, concepts of fraud and unfair or deceptive practices provide a forum for analysis of the effect of material nondisclosures
                        of known material defects in transactions under this Act. When there is a duty to disclose, the same remedies for undisclosed known defects that apply under other laws, including laws relating to goods and services if applicable,
                        are not disturbed and continue to apply to information products. In addition, express warranties under Section 402 and implied warranties under Sections 403 to 405 [[§§ 59.1-504.2, 59.1-504.3 and 59.1-504.5] of this Act may also
                        apply and afford remedies.

                    <p>
                        This Act does not deal with computer viruses or alter existing criminal, tort, or other law on that subject. In most States, intentional introduction of a computer virus into a computer system of another person is a criminal act. See Raymond Nimmer, Information
                        Law § 9.04 (1997). Any remedy in contract, however, must be based on an agreement. Absent agreement, no basis for allocating risk under contract principles exists and this Act leaves the issue to other law.

                        While good faith in performance is an element of all contracts under this Act, the obligation of good faith does not override express contract terms or the right to enforce them. See Kham &amp; Nate’s Shoes No. 2, Inc. v. First Bank of Whiting, 908 F.2d
                        1351 (7th Cir. 1990);
                        <i>
        Amoco Oil Co. v. Ervin,
       </i> 908 P.2d 493 (Colo. 1995);
                        <i>
        Badgett v. Security State Bank,
       </i> 116 Wn.2d 563, 807 P.2d 356 (1991). A lack of good faith is not shown simply by the fact that the party insisted on compliance with contract terms. Neither the idea of honesty nor the idea of fair dealing alters the
                        rule that the obligation of good faith does not override or create new contractual obligations.

                        This section does not support an independent cause of action for failure to perform or enforce in good faith. Rather, a failure to perform or enforce in good faith a specific duty or obligation under the contract is a breach of that contract. The doctrine
                        of good faith directs a court to interpret contracts within the commercial context in which they are created, performed, and enforced, rather than creating a separate duty of fairness and reasonableness which can be independently
                        breached. See PEB Commentary No.10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, terms of an agreement must be defined in light of the commercial context in which the transaction occurs. This principle derives from U.C.C. §
                        <cite class="ocva">
        <a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c2.1a02s1-205" target="_blank">
         1-205
        </a>
       </cite> (1998 Official Text). The terms of an agreement can be as easily found in express contractual language as in the commercial context, such as usage of trade, course of dealing and course of performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, these commercial factors also provide the background and give meaning to language used. The meaning of the terms of an agreement must be interpreted in light of practical considerations that reflect common commercial understanding. Abstract concepts
                        about what an agreement should mean are not as important as are grounded interpretations of what an agreement does mean in context. Section 302 [§ 59.1-503.2].

                            Reasonable Time. Subsection (c) derives from Uniform Commercial Code §
                            <cite class="ocva">

        </cite> (1998 Official Text). Reasonable time, when used in this Act, is gauged by the commercial context. As in the U.C.C., nothing is stronger evidence of a reasonable time than the fixing of such time by an agreement
                            between the parties. However, a court may disregard a contractual term which fixes a time so unreasonable that it amounts to eliminating all remedy under the contract. The parties are not required to fix the most reasonable
                            time but may fix any time which is not manifestly unreasonable as judged at the time of contracting. The agreement that fixes the time need not be part of the main agreement, but may be separate. By virtue of the definition
                            of “agreement,” the circumstances of the transaction, including course of dealing, course of performance, and usage of trade may be material.

                            Reason to Know. This concept is consistent with Restatement (2d) Contracts § 19, comment b. A person has reason to know a fact if the person has information from which a reasonable person would infer that the fact does or will exist based on all the circumstances,
                            including the overall context and ordinary expectations. The person is charged with commercial knowledge of any factors in a particular transaction that in common understanding or ordinary practice are to be expected, including
                            reasonable expectations from usage of trade and course of dealing and widespread business practice. If a person has specialized knowledge or superior intelligence, reason to know is determined in light of whether a reasonable
                            person with that knowledge or intelligence would draw the inference that the fact does or will exist. There is also reason to know if, from all the circumstances, a person exercising reasonable caution regarding the matter
                            in question would infer that there is such a substantial chance that the fact does or will exist that the person would predicate its actions on the assumption of its existence.

                    <p>
                        “Reason to know” must be distinguished from knowledge. Knowledge means an actual conscious belief in or awareness of a fact. Reason to know need not entail a conscious belief in or awareness of the existence of the fact or its probable existence in the
                        future. Of course, a person that has knowledge of a fact also has reason to know of its existence. Reason to know is also to be distinguished from “should know.” “Should know” imports a duty to ascertain facts; the term “reason
                        to know” does not entail or assume an obligation to investigate, but is determined solely by the information available to the party. The latter term is used where the person would not be acting adequately in protecting its own
                        interests if it did not act in light of the facts of which it had reason to know.

                            Scope of the Section. This section requires an authenticated record for enforceability of certain agreements. The section blends Uniform Commercial Code concepts with common law approaches. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section does
                            not make the contract void, it merely precludes a party from relying on it as a defense or to bring a cause of action. Under subsection (e), EDI trading partner and similar authenticated records satisfy this section. The rules
                            in this section also apply to agreements brought within this Act by an agreement.

                            Relationship to Federal Law. Federal intellectual property law may require formalities for enforceability of a contract. These federal rules are not affected by this Act. Section 204(a) of the Copyright Act, for example, requires a signed writing for
                            “transfers of copyright ownership,” which include assignments and certain other transactions. See Konigsberg International v. Rice 16 F.3d 355, 357 (9th Cir. 1994); Library Publications, Inc. v. Medical Economics, Co., 548
                            F. Supp 1231 (E.D. Penn 1982). In general, state law controls regarding non-exclusive licenses. See, e.g., Advent Systems, Ltd. v. Unisys Corp. 925 F.2d 670 (3rd Cir 1991); World Championship Wrestling, Inc. v. GJS Intern.,
                            Inc., 13 F. Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 1998). Friedman v. Select Information Systems, Inc., 221 U.S.P.Q. 848 (N.D. Cal. 1983). Compare Lulirama, Ltd. v. Axcess Broadcast Services 128 F.3d 872, 879 (5th Cir. 1997); I.A.E., Inc.
                            v. Shaver, 74 F.3d 768, 775 (7th Cir. 1996). If federal law applies, the requirements of that law must be met. See, e.g., Radio Television Espanola S.A. v. New World Entertainment,  183 F.3d. 922 (9th Cir. 1999).

                            Basic Rule. Subject to stated exceptions, under subsection (a) an agreement requiring payment of a contract fee of $5,000 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is an authenticated record indicating that a contract was formed
                            and reasonably describing the subject matter or copy. The payments must be required under the agreement assuming that full performance occurs. A royalty provision that might (or might not) ultimately yield millions of dollars
                            of revenue is not within this rule unless the agreement calls for a minimum payment of $5,000 or more. Similarly, an option that might trigger an additional payment is not relevant unless the payment is mandatory.

                                    Over One Year Rule. For a license, a record is required only if the threshold dollar amount is met and the license grants rights for an agreed term of more than one year. This reflects the common law statute of frauds, which centers on the duration of
                                    the contract, and the fact that for licenses the duration of rights is a significant, independent measure of value. A license for a perpetual duration exceeds one year as would any license that designates a term longer
                                    than one year, even if the license permits termination by a party for a reason before that time. However, an option to extend the duration of the license does not bring the contract within the statute unless the option
                                    is mandatory. A license that is subject to termination at will does not exceed a one year duration. This rule refers to the term of the license, not to associated agreements. Thus, a license for a perpetual term is
                                    within this section even if it is accompanied by a support agreement that can be terminated at will.

                                    Record Required. A record, when required, must 1) indicate that a contract was formed, 2) reasonably identify the copy or subject matter involved, and 3) have been authenticated by the party against whom the contract is asserted. No other formalities
                                    are required.

                                    Authenticated. Under the general rule, and subject to exceptions provided in this section, the record must be authenticated by the party to be bound.  See Section 108 [§ 59.1-501.8] regarding proof of authentication.

                                    Subject Matter or Copy. The record must describe the “copy” or “subject matter” covered. “Subject matter” refers to the topic of the agreement; that is, the computer information to which the agreement relates, e.g., the name of a information product,
                                    the type of program to be developed, the database to which access is given, or other identifying descriptions. This does not require a description of the detailed scope of a license or of all terms important to the
                                    contract. For example, in a license to use a digital photograph, a reference to a “photograph of Greenacre” suffices even if the record does not describe the rights granted. There is no requirement that the record describe
                                    the contract fee.

                                    Partial Performance. Under subsection (c)(1), the requirements of subsection (a) are not imposed if there was a tender of performance by one party and acceptance or access by the other. Here, the acts by both parties adequately establish that a contract
                                    may exist; the authenticated record of subsection (a) is unnecessary. Partial performance satisfies the statute of frauds in full, rather than solely with respect to the performance itself. Parol evidence rules and
                                    ordinary contract interpretation principles protect against unfounded claims of extensive contract obligations based on a tender and acceptance of limited performance.

                                    Judicial Admissions. An authenticated record is not needed if the party charged with the contract obligations admits in proceedings that a contract exists. The admission confirms the existence of the contract to the extent of the subject matter admitted.
                                    Consistent with U.C.C. Article 2 (1998 Official Text), however, the admission satisfies the section only to the extent of the subject matter or copies admitted.

                                    Confirming Memoranda. Subsection (d) generally follows U.C.C. § 2-201 (1998 Official Text). Between merchants, failure to respond to a record that confirms may satisfy this section with respect to both parties. The ten day rule in U.C.C. Article 2 is
                                    replaced in this Act by a “reasonable time” to better accommodate varying commercial practices. The rule in subsection (d) validates practice in many industries where the volume or nature of the transactions make it
                                    impossible to prepare and receive assent to records as part of making the initial agreement. The confirming memorandum places the other party on notice that a contract has been formed. It must object to the existence
                                    of a contract if one, in fact, does not exist or otherwise lose protection of this section. Failure to object does not establish that a contract exists or what are the terms, but merely removes the formal barrier in
                                    subsection (a). The burden of persuading a trier of fact that a contract was actually made is not affected by this rule.

                            Other Agreements. Subsection (e) confirms the enforceability of trading partner or similar agreements that alter the requirements of this section with respect to covered transactions. The parties can agree in an authenticated record to conduct business
                            without additional authenticated records. That agreement satisfies the policy of requiring minimal indication that a contract was formed. The purpose of this section is to prevent fraud, not to inhibit development of reasonable

                            Other Laws. Subsection (f) clarifies that the formalities required by this section supplant formalities required under other state laws for transactions within this Act. This rule applies only with respect to state law. Federal law may require more stringent
                            formalities. For example, the Copyright Act requires that an exclusive copyright license be in a writing and makes non-exclusive licenses that are not in a writing subject to subsequent transfers of the copyright.

                    <p>
                        This section does not require that the record be retained or that it contain all material terms of the contract or even that it be designated as a contract. All that is required is that the record afford a basis for believing that offered oral evidence
                        rests on a real agreement. A memorandum that fulfills the conditions suffices. But the record must indicate that a contract was formed, not merely that a contract was being negotiated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Merely because a record satisfies this section does not establish that a contract exists. Nor does it establish the terms of the contract, which must be determined under other sections of this Act. Fulfilling this section merely removes the formal barrier
                        of this section and allows a party to assert the existence of a contract as a basis for a cause of action or a defense. For the contract to actually exist, contract formation rules must be met. For example, while a record need
                        not describe all of the scope of a license to meet this section, there is no contract if there is a material dispute about scope. Section 202 [§ 59.1-502.2]. Satisfying the statute of frauds is merely a gateway to being able to
                        have a court consider whether or not there is a contract.

                    <p>
                        “Copy” refers to the particular copy (e.g., “the copy demonstrated on June 1”) or to a copy of identified computer information. The description must identify the copy in a manner that distinguishes it from other copies or from copies of other information.
                        A record is adequate for this purpose if it refers to “one copy of Word Perfection.” However, a record that refers to “one copy” without designating what computer information is on the copy is inadequate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) adapts a rule from Uniform Commercial Code § 2-201 (1998 Official Text). The required description of a copy or subject matter cannot be defeated for purposes of the statute of frauds by showing that it was incorrect. However, the contract
                        is not enforceable beyond the number of copies or subject matter shown in the authenticated record. Both terms are limitations on enforcement. Thus, a record which refers to “one copy of Word Essence” cannot be enforced beyond
                        one copy of that program. A record that refers to “access to Whisedata” cannot be enforced beyond access to that database and does not support an enforceable right to any copies of it. A term that states “one copy,” but does not
                        say of what, fails this section entirely. A term that states “Wordperfection” may allow proof of a contract for enforceable rights in that work, but does not allow enforcement of any contract rights in or to any copies of the work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exception requires both tender and acceptance or access. Mere possession of a copy does not satisfy this exception, which depends on there being an authorized source that delivered the copy. Similarly, the performance tendered and accepted must be
                        sufficient to show that a contract exists and cannot consist of minor acts of ambiguous nature. Thus, mere access to information at an Internet web site does not satisfy the statute of frauds when there is no indication that a
                        contract exists or that the access resulted in assent to contract terms. Section 112 [§ 59.1-501.12].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Performance under this subsection merely allows the party to attempt to prove the existence of a contract. It does not prove that a contract exists or what terms govern. These must be established under other provisions of this Act. For example, in an
                        alleged contract to develop and deliver three modules of a new computer program, tender and acceptance of one module satisfies the formalities required by the section, but whether there was actually a contract covering three modules
                        must be proven by the party claiming that it exists.

                            Scope of Section. This Act separates the issue of whether a contract is formed from issues of what the terms of the contract are or whether those terms are enforceable. This section deals with contract formation. It is subject to the specific rules on
                            offer and acceptance in subsequent sections. Sections 208, 209, and 210 [§§ 59.1-502.8, 59.1-502.9 and 59.1-502.10] deal with establishing the terms of a contact by an agreed record or by conduct. Often, of course, the same
                            acts that form a contract define its terms.

                            Manner of Formation. Subsection (a) follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-204 (1998 Official Text), the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19, and common law in most States. A contract can be formed in any manner sufficient to show agreement: orally, in
                            writing, by conduct or inaction or otherwise. Of course, no contract is formed without an intent to contract. This section does not impose a contractual relationship where none was intended. In determining whether or not conduct
                            or words establish a contract, courts must look to the entire circumstances, including applicable usage of trade or course of dealing.

                            Time of Formation. Subsection (b) follows U.C.C. § 2-204 (1998 Official Text). If the intent to do so exists, a contract can be formed even though the exact time of its formation is not known or there are terms left open or deferred for later delineation
                            by one party. This rule exists in both the U.C.C. and common law. It focuses on the commercial context and on whether there was an intent to contract, rather than on whether the form or format of an exchange complies with abstract
                            concepts of when a contract should be recognized in law.

                            Open Terms and Layered or Rolling Transactions. Under subsection (c), if the parties intend to be bound, the agreement is binding despite missing or otherwise open terms, so long as any reasonable basis exists for granting a remedy in the event of breach.
                            This rule does not apply if the parties do not intend to be bound unless or until the remaining terms are agreed or reduced to writing. See, e.g., Evolution Online Systems, Inc. v. Koninklijke Nederlan N.V., 145 F.3d 505 (2d
                            Cir. 1998) (applying New York law). There is a difference between preliminary negotiations and actions or statements made with intent to be bound, even though terms are left open. If the parties did not intend to be bound unless
                            terms were later agreed to and there was no later agreement, subsection (e) gives guidance for unwinding the relationship. In law, when a contract is formed and how terms are added over time turns on the intent of the parties.
                            In determining that intent, the more terms left open, the less likely it is that the parties intended to be bound at the outset.

                            Disagreement on Material Terms: Scope. The existence of a contract requires a determination of intent to contract, objectively measured. In some cases, the circumstances clearly indicate that no intent to contract exists. Subsection (d) sets out one such
                            context. A material disagreement about an important (material) term indicates that there is no intent to enter a contract. The “scope” of a license is one such term. It goes to the fundamentals of the transaction, i.e., what
                            the licensor intends to transfer and what the licensee expects to receive. Disagreements about this fundamental issue indicate fundamental failure to agree on a contract. The reference in subsection (d) to disagreement relates
                            to this type of failure to agree and does not refer to a later dispute about the meaning of an agreed term, a point made clear in the second sentence of subsection (d).

                            Failure to Agree. Subsection (e) follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-305(4) (1998 Official Text). While many cases involve layered contracting, the parties may intend not to be bound unless they agree to terms later. See Section 208, Official Comment
                            4. Subsection (e) deals with cases where that later agreement does not occur. The basic rule is that parties are returned to the status that would have existed in the absence of initial agreement. There is an obligation to
                            return copies or information received during the preliminary period. Any contractual use terms in the proposed final deal do not apply because no contract was formed. If, however, the parties agreed to restrictions on the information
                            or copies as part of the process of negotiation or discussion, the restrictions continue as to that information or those copies. The restrictions must be agreed to independent of agreement on the entire proposed contract. This
                            often occurs with terms on nondisclosure of confidential material exchanged in preliminary discussions.

                        Subsection (a) recognizes that an agreement can be formed by operations of electronic agents. This is important for electronic commerce and gives force to choices by a party to use an electronic agent for formation of a contract. The agent’s operations
                        bind the person who deployed the agent for that purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This subsection lays a foundation for the layered contracting that typifies many areas of commerce and is recognized in Uniform Commercial Code § 2-204 (1998 Official Text), as well as in the common law and practice of most States. This foundation is
                        further developed in Sections 208, 209, 304, and 305 [§§ 59.1-502.8, 59.1-502.9, 59.1-503.4 and 59.1-503.5]. Many contract terms are intended, expressly or by usage of trade or the like, to be defined over time, rather than on
                        the occurrence of one specific event. Contract formation is often a process, rather than a single event. A rule that a contract must arise at a single point in time and that this single event defines all the terms of the contract
                        is inconsistent with commercial practice. Contracts are often formed over time; terms are often developed during performance, rather than before performance occurs. Often, parties expect to adopt records later and that expectation
                        itself is the agreement. Rather than modifying an existing agreement, these terms are part of the agreement itself. Treating later terms as proposed modifications is appropriate only if the deal has previously been, in the commercial
                        understanding of both parties, fully closed with no reason to know that new terms would be provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the time in which terms in a layered contract are developed or to be proposed, it is not appropriate to the apply default rules of this Act. The default rules apply only if the agreement of the parties does not deal with the subject matter of the
                        rule. In layered contracting, the agreement is that there are no terms on the undecided issues until they are made express by the parties. Applying a default rule would be applying the rule despite contrary agreement, rather than
                        when no such agreement exists.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The continued effect of such terms assumes an agreement in fact. Thus, a negotiation involving two mutually conditional points only one of which is “agreed to” may not create a contractual use term if the two are mutually condition and no agreement is
                        reached on the second. In any event, the terms do not extend to authorized copies obtained from other sources. For example, a preliminary agreement restricting use of data compression software is binding as to the copies delivered,
                        but it does not preclude the licensee from making an agreement with another authorized source for a copy of the same software. Of course, in addition to contract terms, intellectual property rights may limit a party’s use of information.

                            Scope of Section. This section states general rules on offer and acceptance.  Sections 204 and 205 [§§ 59.1-502.4 and 59.1-502.5] concern acceptances that vary the offer and conditional offers or acceptances; when applicable, those sections control over
                            this section to the extent of a conflict.

                            Reasonable Methods of Acceptance. A party has a right to control the terms under which its offer can be accepted, if it does so expressly.  In many cases, this occurs by insistence on agreement to all terms or on following a stated method for acceptance.
                            If an offeror does not limit the method of acceptance, any reasonable manner of acceptance suffices.  This rule reflects ordinary practice and follows Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19 and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206
                            (1998 Official Text).

                            Shipment or Promise to Ship. Paragraph (2) follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206(1)(b) (1998 Official Text). Either a shipment or a prompt promise to ship the copy is a proper means of acceptance of an offer looking to current shipment of a copy, unless
                            the offer otherwise states.  The second sentence recognizes the fact that, in some cases, it is useful commercially to accommodate a request for a copy with a shipment that may not fully conform.  In such cases, there is no
                            acceptance of the offer if the shipping party notifies the licensee that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation. Paragraph (2) has more limited application in this Act than Article 2.  It applies only to contracts
                            that call solely for a return performance by shipment of a copy. It does not apply to a contract for a license of information since the terms of the license are not set by shipment itself.

                            Beginning of Performance. The beginning of performance by an offeree can be an acceptance if it unambiguously indicates an intent to be bound.  Paragraph (3) follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-206 (1998 Official Text) in limiting that effect to prevent
                            abuse. Beginning performance as acceptance, even if a reasonable means of acceptance, requires notice to the offeror that there has been acceptance.  If this notice is not given in a reasonable time, the offeror can treat its

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with contract formation when the acceptance contains terms that vary the offer, but neither the offer nor the acceptance is expressly conditional on acceptance of all of its own terms. Conditional offers and acceptances
                            are covered in Section 205 [§ 59.1-502.5].

                            Basic Rule. Subsection (a) follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-207(1) (1998 Official Text). If neither the offer nor the acceptance is expressly conditioned on acceptance of its own terms, a definite expression of acceptance may form a contract even if
                            it contains terms that do not fully match the offer. The common law “mirror image” rule was rejected in Article 2 and is not now followed as common law in many states.

                            Material Alteration. A material alteration of an offer by a purported acceptance precludes contract formation based on the purported acceptance.  If a contract is formed in such cases, it must be based on other factors, such as conduct that establishes
                            a contract, another acceptance conforming to the terms of an offer, or other circumstances that clearly show that one party accepted the terms of the other.

                        <li id="t59.1c43a02s59.1-502.4-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Immaterial Alteration. If a definite acceptance does not fully conform to the terms of the offer but does not materially vary it, the acceptance creates a contract. In deciding what are the terms of the contract, Section 210 [§ 59.1-502.10] does not apply,
                            because the contract is formed by offer and acceptance, not conduct.  Under subsection (d), the terms are based on the terms of the offer and other terms as indicated. Conflicting terms in the acceptance are excluded. A conflicting
                            term is one that covers the same subject matter of another term, but in a different way. Subsection (d) allows for inclusion of non-material additional terms in a transaction between merchants unless the offeror timely objects
                            to those terms. An additional term is one that covers a subject not addressed in the offer.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        If a purported acceptance varies from the offer, however, it forms a contract only if the accepting party indicated an intent to form the contract and enough similarity exists between the acceptance and the offer to conclude that acceptance occurred.
                        An acceptance with varying terms must be a definite expression of
                        <i>
        acceptance.
       </i> Anything less is a counter-offer or, perhaps, mere negotiation. Also, a response is not an acceptance if it materially alters the offer. One does not accept by proposing materially different terms. The conditions for
                        treating a response that contains varying terms as an acceptance are seldom met except in cases of standard form purchase orders or invoices. In most other cases, a response with varying terms is a counter-offer, not an acceptance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is a material alteration depends on the commercial context. A nonmaterial alteration refers to an acceptance that adds further minor suggestions or proposals. A material change is one that would result in surprise, hardship or fundamental change
                        if incorporated without express agreement by the other party, or one that would significantly alter the bargain proposed by the offeror. The issue must be judged by what degree of acceptable variation parties might reasonably expect
                        in light of applicable usage of trade and course of dealing. Any change in an offer that is expressly conditional on acceptance of all of its terms is a material change.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with conditional offers or acceptances. In a conflict between this section and general rules on formation, this section controls as to these issues.

                            Basic Rule. Subsection (a) states the basic principle that a person can insist on preconditions for acceptance of its offer without being forced into a different relationship because the conditions are ignored. The most common conditional offer or acceptance
                            limits the other party to acceptance of all of its terms. No principled view of contract law precludes a party from insisting on such conditions and precluding a contract on other terms.  The language of condition need not
                            be in a record or stated in any specific form of language.

                            Standard Forms. The rule does not change merely because the conditions are in a standard form. Conditional forms state the terms under which a party is willing to enter a transaction. The mere fact that the conditions are not tailored to each individual
                            deal does not lessen their effect. Standardization is an ordinary and efficient means of doing business.

                            Battle of Standard Forms. Subsection (b) deals with a situation where both parties use standard forms for offer and acceptance and one or both are conditioned on acceptance of all terms in the form. In that case, if the forms disagree, there is no contract
                            based on the standard forms.  However, the parties often act as if a contract exists and that behavior may form a contract.

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Under subsection (b), the conditional language in a standard form is enforced only if a party proposing the form acts in a manner consistent with the language in its form. If the party whose form is conditional on acceptance of its terms ignores that
                        condition by its own conduct, the condition is not enforced and a contract is created under the section on varying terms. If, on the other hand, the party’s behavior is consistent with its conditional terms, such as by refusing
                        to perform fully, refusing to permit performance, or refusing to accept the benefits of the contract, until the terms are accepted, there is no contract by the exchange of forms unless one party accepted the other party’s terms.
                        If the other party accepts the terms, under paragraph (b)(2) the contract is formed based on those terms, except to the extent they might conflict with expressly agreed terms on price or quantity.

        Illustration 1.
       </b> Licensee sends a standard purchase order form that states that its order is conditional on the Licensor’s assent to the terms of the form. Licensor ships with an invoice conditioning the contract on assent to its terms,
                        but takes no steps to enforce that condition. Purchaser accepts the shipment. Neither party acted consistent with the language of condition. A contract exists but neither condition is enforced. Section 204, 208, or 210 [§ 59.1-502.4,
                        § 59.1-502.8 or § 59.1-502.10] applies.

       </b> In Illustration 1, in response to the purchase order, Licensor refuses to ship unless Licensee agrees to the Licensor’s terms. Until that occurs, there is no contract. Licensor’s terms govern when agreed to by the Licensee.
                        The same result occurs if Licensor ships, but includes in the information a code that prevents use unless the Licensee assents to the Licensor’s terms.

                        no contract; Licensee acted in a manner consistent with its conditional language. Licensee’s terms govern.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with contracts formed by interaction between electronic agents, or between an individual (acting on the individual’s own behalf or for another person such as a company) and an electronic agent.

                            Interaction of Electronic Agents. Interaction of electronic agents creates a contract if the parties use the agents for that purpose and the operations of the electronic agents indicate that a contract exists. Conduct, even automated, can create a contract.
                            Whether a contract is formed focuses on the operations of the agents. The issue is whether those operations indicate that a contract is formed, such as by sending and receiving the benefits of the contract, initiating orders,
                            or indicating in records that a contract exists. The terms of the contract are determined under Section 208 and 209 [§§ 59.1-502.8 and 59.1-502.9] as applicable. However, a contract is formed only by operations taken with respect
                            to a legally significant event. An electronic agent may accept an offer, but acceptance of a message that is not an offer (such as an advertisement) does not form a contract.

                            Electronic Mistake and Fraud. Under subsection (a), restrictions analogous to common law concepts of fraud and mistake are made applicable to this automated context to prevent abuse or clearly unexpected results. Of course, parties may allocate risk of
                            mistake or fraud in an agreement.

                            Interaction of Human and Electronic Agent. Contracts may be formed by interaction of an individual (human being) and an electronic agent. Subsection (b) does not define all cases where this can occur or the results of all interactions, such as where the
                            individual is not aware that he is dealing with an electronic agent. The section describes one setting with two elements: 1) an electronic agent programmed to make contracts, and 2) an individual, having the ability not to
                            do so, engaging in conduct or making a statement with reason to know that this will cause the electronic agent to provide the benefits of the contract or otherwise indicate acceptance. If the individual is dealing with an electronic
                            agent, it may be that not all statements or actions by the individual can be reacted to by the electronic agent. A contract is formed if the human makes statements or engages in conduct that indicate assent. Statements purporting
                            to alter or vitiate agreement to which the electronic agent cannot react are ineffective.

                    <p>
                        Assent does not occur if the operations are induced by mistake, fraud or the like, such as where a party or its electronic agent manipulates the programming or response of the other electronic agent in a manner akin to fraud. Such acts vitiate the assent
                        that would occur through normal operations of the agent. Similarly, the inference is vitiated if, because of aberrant programming or through an unexpected interaction of the two agents, operations indicating existence of a contract
                        occur in circumstances that are not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. Such circumstances are analogous to mutual mistake. Courts applying these concepts should refer to mistake or fraud doctrine, even though an
                        electronic agent cannot actually be said to have been misled or mistaken.

       </b> Officer dials the telephone information system using the company credit card. A computerized voice states: “If you would like us to dial your number, press ‘1’; there will be an additional charge of $1.00. If you would
                        like to dial yourself, press ‘2.”’ Officer states into the phone that the company will not pay the $1.00 additional charge, but will pay .50. Having stated these conditions, Officer strikes “1.” The computer dials the number. User’s
                        “counter offer” is ineffective, because Officer has reason to know that the program cannot react to the counter offer. The charge to dial the number includes the additional $1.00.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with the enforceability and duration of a release.  A release is a promise that the releasing party will not object to, or exercise any remedies to limit, the use of computer information or informational rights, but
                            does not contain significant, affirmative obligations by the releasing party.

                            Basic Rule. A release is enforceable without consideration if it is in a record to which the releasing party agrees, by manifesting assent or otherwise.  This includes all means of assent and all forms of creating a record, such as by filmed assent. The
                            rule clarifies the enforceability of releases in a record, but it does not alter other law making releases enforceable, whether or not supported by consideration, such as the law of estoppel or waiver.

                        <li id="t59.1c43a02s59.1-502.7-officialcomment.1ol13">
                            Duration. The duration of a release is determined by its terms. If there is no stated duration, the common law regarding duration of contracts applies.  However, subsection (b) states a different rule for releases where there is no significant involvement
                            by a party to support the other’s use of the information or rights.  In these cases, the release is for the duration of the released rights.  Of course, a release is effective only according to its own substantive terms; a
                            release for use of an image at an Internet site does not release rights for other uses of that image.

        Illustration:
       </b> In Internet “chat room” and “list service” systems, participation often requires permission by the participant to allow use of comments or materials submitted. If the relationship granting that permission is supported
                        by assent and consideration (e.g., one party grants the right to use the service in return for the release), the release is enforceable under ordinary contract law principles of offer and acceptance. This section makes clear that
                        the release is enforceable without consideration.

                            Scope of Section. This Act deals separately with when a contract is formed and what are its terms, although the same conduct often does both. This section states when a party adopts a record as the contract. Section 209 [§ 59.1-502.9] limits terms in
                            mass-market licenses. Section 210 [§ 59.1-502.10] deals with when records do not create terms, but a contract exists by conduct. Trade use, course of dealing, and course of performance are also relevant as are the supplementary
                            rules of this Act for topics on which the other sources of terms do not control.

                            Adopting Terms. A party that assents to a record adopts the record as the terms of the contract whether or not the record is a standard form. There is no difference between a customized record or terms of a standard form. Standard forms are common and
                            provide efficiencies for both parties; they are used by both licensees and licensors. Treating them as of lesser effect than other records would place commercial contract law in conflict with commercial practice.

                            Later Terms: Layered Contracting. Subsection (b) reflects the reality of layered contracting. While some contracts are formed and their terms defined at a single point in time, many transactions involve a rolling or layered process. The commercial expectation
                            is that terms will follow or be developed after performance begins. This Act rejects cases that narrowly treat contracting as a single event despite ordinary practice. It adopts a rule in cases that recognize that contracts
                            are often formed over time. See, e.g., ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996); M.A. Mortenson Co., Inc. v. Timberline Software Corp., 970 P.2d 803 (Wash. 2000).

                                    Reason to Know. Contract terms proposed for later agreement to complete the initial contract are part of the initial contracting process if the parties had reason to know that later terms would be proposed. “Reason to know” means that, realistically considered,
                                    later presentation of terms should not be a surprise. It does not require specific notice or specific language, although such factors may be important because notice suffices. “Reason to know” can also be inferred from
                                    the circumstances, including ordinary business practices or marketing approaches of which a party is or should be aware and from which a reasonable person would infer that terms will follow. The time over which the
                                    record can be proposed must be reasonable as shaped by the expectations of the parties, the context and their agreement. Compare Section 209 [§ 59.1-502.9]. At some point, the deal is closed, but when this is true requires
                                    analysis focused on the context and circumstances. If the parties considered terms of the deal to be closed, subsequently proposed terms are proposed modifications.

                                    Specification of Terms. Subsection (b) deals with cases that differ from those under Section 305, which governs agreements that give one party a right to specify terms. In cases under Section 305, the party receiving terms is not asked to assent; the
                                    agreement gives the other party the right to specify terms. Since no assent is required, the terms must be proposed in good faith and in accord with reasonable commercial standards. Those conditions are not appropriate
                                    when the party receiving terms can simply refuse them.

                            Later Terms: Roadmap. The following gives guidance on how to handle cases with later terms. Unless the parties’ agreement is that one party has the right to specify terms without the other party being required to assent to the terms (see, e.g., Sections
                            304 and 305 [§§ 59.1-503.4 and 59.1-503.5]), as a general rule the later terms do not become part of the contract unless the party receiving them agrees to the terms such as by manifesting assent after having an opportunity
                            to review often including a right to return, as described in sections 102(a)(57), 112, 113, 208, and 209. This Act applies in the following way:

                            Mass-Market Cases. Subsection (b) applies in the mass market. However, Section 209 [§ 59.1-502.9] places limits on when proposal of the terms must occur and precludes altering terms expressly agreed by the parties.

                            Right to a Return. In some cases, if assent is sought after the person has paid or delivered or become obligated to pay or deliver, the manifestation of assent is not effective unless the person has a right to a return if it refuses the proposed terms.
                            Section 112; 113 [§§ 59.1-501.12; 59.1-501.13:1]. This rule applies in mass market transactions and to other cases where the licensor’s performance is mere delivery of a copy, but does not apply in more complex commercial contexts
                            where general principles of equity govern because of the complexity. Section 202(e) provides guidance where the parties did not intend to have a contract in the absence of agreeing to terms.

                            Adoption of Terms. Assent to a record adopts all terms of the record; there is no requirement that the party read, understand or separately assent to each term. Of course, enforceability of terms is subject to doctrines set out in this Act regarding unconscionability,
                            public policy, good faith, and the like. But this Act rejects Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 211(3). Absent unconscionability, fraud or similar conduct, parties are bound by the terms to which they assent after having
                            had an opportunity to review.

                        A party is bound by the terms of a record only if it agrees to it, by manifesting assent or otherwise. Assent can be by authenticating the record or by other conduct indicating assent. However, a party cannot assent unless it had an opportunity to review
                        the record before reacting. Section 113 [§ 59.1-501.13:1]. See Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., — F.3d —, 2002 WL 31166784 n. 13 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

                        • If the parties did not have reason to know that terms would be proposed later for assent and a contract was formed before the terms were available for review and assent, the later terms are treated as proposed modifications that may be accepted or rejected

                        those terms; but if the later terms are rejected, there is no contract and the parties’ obligations are determined by this Act, including Sections 208, 209 and 202(e) as applicable.

                        terms are left open pursuant to this Act, including Section 306, unless covered by other agreement of the parties.

                            Scope of Section. Mass-market licenses are typically standard forms where the licensee either takes or leaves the license. Thus, significant protections are provided in this section. This section must be read in connection with Sections 208 [§ 59.1-502.8],
                            112 and 113. In addition, trade use, course of dealing, and course of performance are relevant, as are the supplementary terms of this Act on issues not resolved by express terms or sources of practical construction.  Sections
                            116(c), 302 [§§ 59.1-501.16(b), 59.1-503.2]. Many mass-market licenses are available for review and agreed to at the outset of a transaction; but some licenses are presented later. This section deals with both and relies also
                            on the rules in Section 208. Many mass-market transactions involve three parties and two contracts. That circumstance is addressed here and in Section 613 [§ 59.1-506.13].

                            General Rules for Enforceability. Several limiting concepts govern where assent to a record is relevant to establishing the terms of a mass-market license:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li id="t59.1c43a02s59.1-502.9-officialcomment.1ol12a">
                                    Unconscionability and Fundamental Public Policy. Even if a party agrees to a mass market license, paragraph (a)(1) makes clear a court may invalidate unconscionable terms or terms against fundamental public policy under rules that apply to all contracts
                                    under this Act. Unconscionability doctrine invalidates terms that are bizarre or oppressive and hidden in boilerplate language. See Section 111 [§ 59.1-501.11]. For example, a term in a mass-market license for $50 software
                                    providing that any default causes a default in all other licenses between the parties may be unconscionable, if there was no reason for the licensee to anticipate that breach of the small license would breach an unrelated
                                    larger license between the parties. Similarly, a clause in a mass-market license that grants a license-back of a licensee’s trademarks or trade secrets without any discussion of the issue would ordinarily be unconscionable.
                                    This section rejects the additional test in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 211(3).

                                    Conflict with Expressly Agreed Terms. Paragraph (a)(2) provides that standard terms in a mass-market license cannot alter terms expressly agreed to between the parties to the license. A term is expressly agreed if the parties discuss and come to agreement
                                    regarding the issue and the term becomes part of the bargain. For example, if a librarian acquires software for children from a licensor under an express agreement that the software may be used in its library network,
                                    a term in the license that limits use to a single user computer system conflicts with and is overridden by the agreement for a network license. Similarly, in a consumer contract where the vendor promises a “90 day right
                                    to a refund” and the parties agree to that, the mass-market license cannot alter that term between those parties. Of course, there must be an agreement and this rule is subject to traditional parol evidence concepts.
                                    This rule is consistent with Section 613 where the terms of a publisher’s license do not alter the agreement between the end user and the retailer unless expressly adopted by them.

                                    Assent and Agreement. Under this Act, a party adopts the terms of a mass market license only if it agrees to the record, by manifesting assent or otherwise. A party cannot do so unless it had an opportunity to review the record before it agrees. Section
                                    112. Paragraph (a)(3) makes clear that, under Section 113, the record must be available for review and called to the person’s attention in a manner such that a reasonable person ought to have noticed it before assenting.
                                    See Section 113. The opportunity to review the terms must come before assent to them.

                                    Ability to Retain Terms. Paragraph (a)(4) provides additional licensee protection not present in other law. The person presenting terms of a mass-market license must make it possible for the licensee to retain a copy of the agreed license, or to obtain
                                    a copy if the contract was presented in a context in which it originally could not have been retained (e.g., presentation at a kiosk with no printing or copying capability). The ability to retain the license terms enables
                                    the licensee to have information about its obligations on an ongoing basis. Paragraph (a)(4) provides for a right that typically is not mandated in other general contract law (such as UCC Article 2). It outlines three
                                    options in which this capability to retain the agreed record can be achieved:
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            Relevance of a License. The enforceability of a license is important to both the licensor and the licensee. License terms define the product by, for example, distinguishing between a right to use for a single user or with multiple users on a network,
                            or between a right to consumer use or a right to commercial use. Often, the license benefits the licensee, giving it rights that would not be present in the absence of a license or rights that could not be exercised without
                            permission of the owner of informational rights. See, e.g., Green Book International Corp. v. Inunity Corp., 2 F. Supp.2d 112](D. Mass. 1998). The license allows the licensee to avoid infringement.

                            Terms Prior to Payment. If a mass-market license is presented before the price is paid, this Act follows general law that enforces a standard form contract if the party assents to it.  The fact that license terms are non-negotiable does not invalidate
                            them under general contract law or this Act.  A conclusion that a contract is a contract of adhesion may, however, require courts to take a closer look at terms to prevent unconscionability.  See, e.g., Klos v. Polske Linie
                            Lotnicze, 133 F.3d 164 (2d Cir. 1998); Fireman’s Fund Insurance v. M.V. DSR Atlantic, 131 F.3d 1336 (9th Cir. 1998); Chan v. Adventurer Cruises, Inc., 123 F.3d 1287 (9th Cir. 1997).  This Act’s concepts of manifest assent and
                            opportunity to review also address concerns relevant to such a review.

                            Terms after Initial Agreement. Mass market licenses may be presented after initial general agreement from the licensee. In some distribution channels this allows a more efficient mode of contracting between end users and remote parties; this is especially
                            important where the remote party controls copyright or similar rights in the information. Enforceability of the license is important to both parties. Under federal law, a mere sale of a copy of a copyrighted work does not give
                            the copy owner a number of rights that it may desire. The limitations in subsection (b) impose significant costs that create incentives for licensors to present terms at the outset when practicable for the distribution channel
                            employed.

                                    Timing of Assent. Agreement to the mass-market record must occur no later than during the initial use of the information. This limits the time during which layered contracting may occur in the mass market and reflects customary practices in software and
                                    other industries. Of course, any applicable federal law that establishes a right to rescind a contract and return a product is not altered by this Act.  Section 105 [§ 59.1-501.5].  Also, assent to the record does not
                                    alter the licensee’s right to refuse a defective product that constitutes a breach of contract. Assent to contract terms is different from acceptance of a copy. “Acceptance” of the copy ordinarily requires a right to
                                    inspect it. See Section 608 [§ 59.1-506.8]. For mass-market transactions, this Act follows U.C.C. Article 2 on this issue.

                                    Cost Free Return. Under subsection (b), if terms are not available for review until after an initial agreement, the party being asked to assent must have a right to reject the terms return the information product. Possible liability for the expense of
                                    reinstating a customer’s system after review, creates an incentive to make the license or a copy available for review before the initial obligation is created. This Act refers to a return right, rather than a right
                                    to a refund, because, under developing technologies, the right may apply to either the licensee or the licensor, whichever is asked to assent to the record. See Section 102(57) (defining the right of return).

                                    Notice of the Right to Return. Subsection (d) provides that notice must be given indicating the person from whom the refund and return can be obtained. The notice may be given in the license or otherwise at a time making it possible for the person refusing
                                    the license terms to obtain a return within any reasonable time stated for it or, if no time is stated, a reasonable time. See Section 102(57) (defining the right of return). The purpose is to allow the licensee to
                                    assert its rights within the period for a return if it chooses to refuse the license. The section does not require the notice to include address or telephone information because, in mass-market distribution, the identity
                                    of the eventual retailer or other person from which a copy was obtained cannot be known in advance. In such cases, the person can be described, for example, as ‘the store from which you obtained this copy.’ See also

                        Adopting terms of a record under this section for a mass-market license is pursuant to Section 208, and is subject to the limits stated in that section. If the terms of the record are proposed after a party commences performance, they are effective only
                        if the party had reason to know that terms would be proposed and agrees or manifests assent to the terms once proposed. For mass-market licenses, however, even if reason to know exists at the outset, under this section the terms
                        must be made available no later than during the initial performance or use of the information and the person has a statutory right to a return if it refuses the license.

                        This paragraph is satisfied if a copy can be kept, printed or stored etc. after the licensee consents to the license, or obtained on request, whether the licensee
                        <i>
        in fact
       </i> keeps or prints it at all or at that time, or uses a device that could do so. This is consistent with commentary to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. See 146 Cong. Rec. S5281-06,
                        at S5285, 106th Cong., 2d Sess. (June 16, 2000) (statement of Sen. Abraham).

                        The terms of mass-market contracts can be established in many ways. An oral agreement may suffice as would an agreement to terms in a record. Product descriptions may define the bargain without reference to any record containing contractual terms. Parties
                        may leave terms open and agree that the terms may be specified later by a party.

                        Most courts under current law enforce contract terms that are presented and assented to after initial agreement. See, e.g., Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, 111 S. Ct. 1522 (1991);

                        Subsection (b) imposes some added limitations. It allows such terms to be enforceable only if there is agreement, or if there is a manifestation of assent after a chance to review terms and only pursuant to the rule that a party that rejects terms for
                        information must be given a cost free right to say no. This does not mean that the licensee can reject the license and use or copy the information. The right to a return creates a situation equivalent to that which would have existed
                        if the licensee had a chance to review the terms and rejected the license at the preliminary agreement. It does not apply if the licensee agrees to the license. However, a mass-market licensee who agrees to the license but receives
                        a nonconforming product has a right to reject the copy and obtain a refund of the contract fee as a remedy for breach of the contract. See Section 704(b) [§ 59.1-507.4].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The return right under this section includes, but expands on the return right described in Section 113. In this section, the return right is cost free in that it requires reimbursement for reasonable costs of making the return and, if installation of
                        the information was required to review the license, the reasonable costs in returning the system to its initial condition. The fact that this section states an affirmative right in mass market licenses does not affect whether under
                        an agreement or other law, a similar right exists in other contexts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The expenses incurred in return relate only to the subject matter of the rejected license (the computer information) and do not include goods delivered in the same transaction. Rights regarding the goods are governed by Uniform Commercial Code Article
                        2 or 2A. The expenses must be reasonable and foreseeable. The costs of return do not include attorney fees or the cost of using an unreasonably expensive means of return or lost income or the like unless such expenses are required
                        to comply with instructions of the licensor. The reimbursement right refers to ordinary expenses, such as the cost of postage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, if expenses are incurred because the information must be installed to review the license, expenses of reversing changes caused by the installation that are chargeable to the licensor must be reasonable and foreseeable. The reference here is
                        to actual, out-of-pocket expenses and not to compensation for lost time or lost opportunity or for consequential damages. The expenses must be foreseeable. A licensor may be reasonably charged with ordinary requirements of a licensee
                        that are consistent with others in the same general position, but is not responsible for losses caused by the particular circumstances of the licensee of which it had no notice. A twenty-dollar mass market license should not expose
                        the provider to significant loss unless the method of presenting the license can be said ordinarily to cause such loss. Similarly, it is ordinarily not reasonable to provide recovery of disproportionate expenses associated with
                        eliminating minor and inconsequential changes in a system that do not affect its functionality. On the other hand, the provider is responsible for actual reasonable expenses that are foreseeable from the method used to obtain assent.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with contracts formed by conduct, rather than by offer and acceptance or agreement to a record. Contracts formed by conduct arise in various settings. One involves a “battle of forms” in which, under Sections 204 and
                            205 [§§ 59.1-502.4 and 59.1-502.5], the exchanged records did not result in an effective offer and acceptance, but both parties engaged in conduct indicating that a contract was formed.  If agreed records or an oral offer-acceptance
                            form a contract, this section does not apply simply because agreed records do not cover all relevant terms.  In such cases, terms of the agreement are determined under the general rules of this Act, including appropriate weight
                            for usage of trade, course of performance, and course of dealing. See, e.g., Sections 116(b); 301; 302 [§§ 59.1-501.16(c), 59.1-503.1, 59.1-503.2].

                            Interpret based on Context. This section requires a court to determine contractual terms by considering all commercial circumstances, including the nature of conduct, the informational rights involved, applicable trade usage or course of dealing, and
                            any terms that were expressly agreed without condition or because of an assumption about what would be the agreed performance due from the other party which conditions or assumptions were not met.  No hierarchy is established
                            except for that arising under Section 302 [§ 59.1-503.2]. Given the fluid nature of the context, usage of trade and course of dealing have special importance. If a court cannot determine the contract terms from the foregoing,
                            then, the supplemental rules contained in this Act may serve as gap-fillers to supply the terms. Consideration of all factors requires a practical interpretation of the relationship. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 202(1)
                            (2) (1981); 2 Farnsworth, Contracts § 7.10 (1990).  Formalistic rules cannot account for the contextual nuances that exist in the rich environment of transactional practice.  This section rejects the so-called “knock-out” rule
                            where terms in records  are thrown out and not considered, and are instead replaced by default rules of this Act; that rule is too rigid for information transactions where contract terms often define the product and the scope
                            of the grant.

                            Battle of Forms and Conduct. Some information transactions involve an exchange of inconsistent standard forms coupled with conduct of both parties indicating the existence of a contract. One of two results may occur. The first is that a contract is formed
                            by one or both forms and conduct is irrelevant either because the forms do not materially disagree or because a conditional offer or acceptance of one party was agreed to or otherwise adopted by the other.  When this occurs,
                            the contract is not within this section. The second possibility is that the records and conduct related to them do not establish a contract (e.g., they materially disagree). See Sections 204 and 205 [§§ 59.1-502.4 and 59.1-502.5].
                            Such cases are within this section if the conduct of the parties nevertheless creates an enforceable contract. Subsection (a) directs the court to review the entire circumstances regardless of which form was first received
                            or last sent, but including factors such as the terms of the exchanged records and established trade usage, course of dealing, and course of performance.

                            Scope of License. In information transactions, contract terms relating to the scope of the grant define the product being licensed and lie at the core of the agreement. See Comments to Section 102(a)(58) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(58)]. The subject matter (e.g.,
                            a copy of software) has entirely different value depending on what rights are granted, but that often cannot be determined from the copy itself (the copy may be license of a single-user or for network use). That being true,
                            it is especially important to give special deference to scope issues in a manner that protects valuable informational rights.

                        Under subsection (a), the information or informational rights involved are relevant factors. Where there is a significant disagreement about an important element of scope, a court should be careful not to make a determination that creates rights or imposes
                        obligations beyond those actually agreed to by the parties, because that in effect would transfer away valuable property of one party based on a judicial determination made on unclear facts. That risk argues for rejecting any expansive
                        interpretation of ambiguous conduct. Absent clear agreement to the contrary, if a contract is formed by conduct, the court should consider the following principles:

                            The court should avoid creating a scope that requires the licensor to have or to acquire rights it did not own or have a right to license at the time of contracting, or that exceed the rights the licensor then had.  Thus, if when the contract was created
                            by conduct, the licensor only had the right to grant a license for the Southwest United States, the court should avoid interpreting conduct as indicating a scope that includes rights for the East Coast or forcing the licensor
                            into an infringement.

                            The court should avoid expanding the licensee’s rights beyond the actual agreement of the parties.  A court needs to understand and effectuate the importance of this issue from the licensor’s standpoint, protecting important property rights which it holds.
                            Thus, the mere fact that the licensee may have used the licensed rights in the East Coast should not lead a court to conclude that the bargain must therefore have included those rights.  Such an interpretation could encourage
                            infringement as a means of expanding rights.

                            The court should avoid making the licensee liable for infringement because of conduct exceeding the scope, if the conduct occurred at a time when the licensee reasonably and in good faith believed that it was acting within the agreed scope. Good faith
                            conduct can be protected in appropriate cases by applying equitable principles without creating a grant that may not have been intended by the licensor.

                            Decision of the Court. Issues of whether a particular procedure is commercially reasonable or otherwise about its efficacy in a particular context are decisions made by the court.  This Act does not require a commercially reasonable attribution procedure
                            or adopt any one type of procedure as reasonable or otherwise efficacious.  Other law may do so, as may the agreement of the parties.

                            Nature of an Attribution Procedure. Evolving technology and commercial practice make it impractical to predict future developments and unwise to preclude developments by a narrow statutory mandate describing what type of procedure is appropriate.  This
                            Act relies on the parties to select or use an appropriate procedure.  If an attribution procedure is established by agreement or adopted by both parties, assent is the predicate for allowing the procedure to affect substantive
                            rights subject to normal restrictions on enforcement of contract terms, such as the doctrine of unconscionability.  A procedure of which one party is not aware does not qualify as having been agreed to or adopted by the parties
                            as an attribution procedure. However, parties dealing for the first time may adopt a procedure at that time, there is no requirement of agreement in advance. Similarly, a procedure may be established by one party in connection
                            with a third person (such as in the issuance of a digital signature, or the creation of an attribution procedure to be used among a group of member companies) and adopted in a particular transaction such as where another party
                            accepts and relies on the issued digital signature.

                            Efficacy and Commercially Reasonableness. The general idea of efficacy or commercial reasonableness is that the procedure be a reasonably effective method in the commercial context reasonably suited to the task for which it is used.  This does not require
                            the procedure to be state of the art, the most reasonable procedure, or an infallible procedure.  The decision must take into account the choices of the parties as well as the effectiveness and cost relative to the value of
                            the transactions.  How one gauges efficacy or commercial reasonableness depends on a variety of factors, including the agreement, the choices of the parties, technology, the types of transactions affected by the procedure,
                            sophistication of the parties, volume of similar transactions engaged in, availability of feasible alternatives, cost and difficulty of utilizing alternative procedures, and procedures in general use for similar types of transactions.
                            The commercial reasonableness concept is similar to that in Uniform Commercial Code § 4A-202(c) (1998 Official Text). In most cases, the efficacy of a procedure is related to whether it is a commercially reasonable procedure.
                            The quality of an attribution procedure may reasonably be tailored to the particular transaction and the degree of risk involved.  Additionally, if a procedure results from a negotiated agreement of the parties or decisions
                            of informed commercial entities entering a relationship, it should receive deference.  This flows from the principle of contractually assumed risk and the principle that the parties’ agreement should ordinarily be enforced.
                            The same principle may apply in non-negotiated situations.  If two parties generally aware of the risks of a particular procedure, agree to use the procedure for a particular transaction, they have in effect concluded that
                            the procedure is sufficiently effective or commercially reasonable in their context to accept the risks.

                    <p>
                        In some cases, statutes or regulations define a particular attribution procedure as appropriate or as applicable to a given context. These laws, such as digital signature statutes, establish by law a procedure that qualifies as an attribution procedure
                        in this Act and that, under paragraph (1) are per se effective or commercially reasonable within the scope of coverage of the statute or regulation.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with when an electronic authentication, message, record or performance is attributed to a particular person and with the consequences of failure to follow a procedure intended to detect errors. Attribution to a person
                            means that the electronic event is treated in law as having come from that person.

                            Nature of Attribution. Subsection (a) clarifies that the party seeking to attribute the source of an electronic authentication, message, record or performance to a particular party bears the burden of doing so. “Burden of establishing” means “the burden
                            of persuading the trier of fact that the existence of a fact (e.g., attribution) is more probable than its non-existence.” In effect, a party (either the licensor or the licensee) that desires to attribute an order or a shipment
                            or license to a particular party bears the burden and the risk of being able to do so.

                            Nature of Proof. Subsection (b) states the principle that the efficacy and other characteristics of an attribution procedure used by the parties are part of proof of attribution. The role of an attribution procedure agreed to or used by the parties varies
                            depending on the character of the procedure. Compliance with a commercially reasonable attribution procedure that has a level of effectiveness suitable to that context may be treated by the court as carrying the burden of establishing
                            attribution referred to in subsection (a), subject to rebuttal by appropriate evidence, such as by a showing that the party in fact had no role in causing or permitting the electronic authentication, message, record or performance
                            to occur. For example, if the parties agree to an attribution procedure, the party seeking to rely on attribution to the other has the burden of establishing the agreement, the fact that it was followed in good faith and other
                            relevant attributes of the procedure. Having done that, under general law, the burden may pass to the other party to establish that neither he nor a person with authority to act were responsible for the message or performance.
                            On the other hand, a procedure with very limited effectiveness not reasonably suited to the context might have no effect at all in the evidentiary mix. Of course, this all depends on existing law regarding the burden of establishing
                            a fact; this Act does not change that law.

                            Role of Agreement. This section is subject to contrary agreement. An agreement here may have the effect of creating an attribution procedure that later plays a role in proving to whom the message is attributed. The agreement, however, may also deal with
                            the effect of the procedure itself, and thereby override the rules in this section. For example, an agreement between a law firm and West Publishing may provide that the law firm is responsible for the costs associated with
                            any use for database access of the identification code issued to it. The identification code is an attribution procedure. Absent agreement on its effect, the effect of its use would be controlled under this section. In the
                            hypothetical case, however, the agreement itself specifies the effect of use of the code and that agreement controls. No special language is necessary to achieve this result: the agreement is enforceable under the same standards
                            as any other term of an agreement. Thus, it must not be unconscionable or violate a fundamental public policy. See Sections 105 and 111 [§ 59.1-501.5 and 59.1-501.11].

                            Failure to Use. Subsection (d) deals in a limited way with the effect of a failure by one party to conform to an attribution procedure. If the sender complies, but the recipient does not, the sender is entitled to its rights or damages under any agreement
                            between the parties regarding the attribution procedure and its effects; in the absence of an agreement, the complying party (sender) may choose not to be bound by an error that would have been detected through compliance by
                            the other party (recipient).

                        Attribution might involve reliance on agency law principles. In addition, the reference in subsection (a) to “other law” makes clear that the concept covers circumstances in which a person is bound by the act of another even though the acting person might
                        not qualify as an agent. For example, if a woman gives her on-line account password to her brother so that he may use the account, his acts will be attributed to her even though he is not necessarily her agent. If he steals the
                        password, she is not bound by his actions unless other law requires her to bear the consequences of his actions (e.g., by contract or under some state electronic signature statutes her liability may be allocated to her, or a cause
                        of action for negligence might exist in some circumstances).

                            Scope of Section. This section creates a statutory electronic error correction procedure for consumers that supplements common law concepts of mistake.  The section does not displace the common law of mistake or alter law concerning transactions that
                            do not involve a consumer.  It does not apply to transactions excluded from this Act. The procedure created here establishes a rule that avoids the complexity and uncertainty of relying solely on common law principles about
                            mistake in an automated world.  In common law in many states, a party making a unilateral mistake is responsible for its consequences. This section creates a consumer protection that avoids such decisions.

                            Electronic Errors: Defined. An “electronic error” contemplates a situation in which a consumer’s conduct results in an error in an electronic message.  This section allows the consumer, by prompt action, to avoid the effect of the mistake. The defense
                            does not apply if the electronic system with which the consumer is working reasonably provides a reasonable means to correct or avoid errors.  Thus, a consumer’s mistake in erroneously entering “11” as the number of copies
                            desired may be an error, but does not come within this section if the automated ordering system with which the consumer interacts requires confirmation of the quantity or reasonably allows the consumer to correct any error
                            before sending the order.  The rule thus provides an incentive to establish error-correction procedures in automated contracting systems and provides protection to the consumer where such procedures are not present.

                            Avoiding the Effect of Error. If an electronic error occurs, a consumer can avoid responsibility for the unintended message if the consumer acts promptly. However, the message must not have been intended. Error avoidance is not a right to rescind a contract
                            because of second thoughts.

                            Transactions Not Within the Section. This section does not alter law in transactions that do not involve consumers or where consumers use electronic agents. The diversity of commercial transactions make a simple rule such as that stated here inappropriate
                            because of the different patterns of risk and the greater ability of commercial parties to develop tailored solutions to the problem of errors.  A court addressing electronic errors in these other contexts should apply general
                            common law.  The existence of the defense in this section for a consumer does not affect remedies under the general law of mistake, including in cases where the consumer does not qualify for the defense.

                            Relation to other Law. This section does not alter other consumer protection laws.  In addition, it does not alter credit card or other rules regarding the responsibility of a consumer or a merchant to parties who provide payment or credit services relating
                            to the transaction.  Financial services transactions are excluded from this Act.  Thus if an error by a consumer causes an order for ten copies, rather than one copy, as between the consumer and the licensor, this section applies.
                            However, if the transaction were made with a credit card, the consumer’s responsibility to the card issuer under the credit card remains governed by law applicable to that transaction and by the card issuer’s disputed charge
                            resolution procedures.

                    <p>
                        What is a reasonable procedure for correcting errors depends on the commercial context, including the extent to which the transaction entails immediate reactions. For example, in a transaction which occurs over a several day period, it may be reasonable
                        to require a verification of a bid or order before it is placed, while in an on-line, real time auction, reconfirmation may not be possible. A reasonable procedure may entail no more than requiring two separate indications confirming
                        that the bid should be entered or, where the formatting allows correction, requesting that the consumer check and correct the bid before the “Bid Now” button is pressed. As elsewhere, the idea of a reasonable procedure here does
                        not require use of the most effective procedure, of special detection software or even the most reasonable, it requires that, all things taken into account, the procedure is commercially reasonable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To avoid the effects of an electronic error, the consumer must act promptly on learning of the error or of the other party’s reliance. The consumer must notify the other party of the error and deliver back, at the consumer’s cost, any copies of information
                        received in the same condition as received. Return of copies is not required if the other party reasonably instructs the consumer to destroy the copies. However, the consumer must act promptly in a manner that returns the other
                        party to the position that would have been true if the error had not occurred. Compare European Union
                        <i>
        Distance Contract Directive
       </i> (no rescission right for consumer if software is not returned unopened).

                    <p>
                        This defense builds on equity principles that permit a party to avoid the consequences of its error if the error causes no detrimental effect to another party and does not give a benefit to the person making the mistake. The defense does not apply if
                        the consumer used the information or otherwise received a benefit from it or the error. Since there may be unavoidable detrimental effects on the party who received an erroneous message (e.g., costs of filling erroneous orders),
                        courts must apply this rule with care. The basic assumption is that the defense works when there is no detrimental effect on the person who did not make the error, but that assumption is particularly suspect in cases where the
                        nature of the information product makes for high costs to the provider or risk of fraud worked by the consumer.

                            Time of Receipt Rule. Subsection (a) adopts a time of receipt rule; rejecting the mailbox rule for electronic messages and resolving uncertainty about what common law rule would otherwise govern. See Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2] (definition of “receipt”).
                            This time-of-receipt rule reflects both the relatively instantaneous nature of electronic messaging and places the risk on the sending party if receipt does not occur. As used in this Section, “effectiveness” of a notice parallels
                            the usage in Uniform Commercial Code §
                            <cite class="ocva">

        </cite> (27) (1998 Official Text). The receipt of the message is “effective” when received, but the receipt being effective does not create a presumption that the message contains no errors, that its content is adequate
                            or that it was sent by any particular person. Whether the message formed a contract is determined by ordinary offer and acceptance rules and whether an existing contract has been modified is determined by ordinary rules on
                            modification. Neither effect happens simply because receipt of a message is effective without more.

                            Effect of Acknowledgment. Acknowledgment is not acceptance, although an acceptance can also be treated as an acknowledgment. Acknowledgment proves receipt but does not create any presumption about the identity of the person sending the acknowledgment.
                            That can be established by an attribution procedure agreed to or adopted by the parties or established by law, but this section does not create any presumptions.   Questions about the accuracy or the general content of the
                            received message also are not treated here.  Of course, by agreement the parties address all of these issues.

                        The message is “effective” when received, not when read or reviewed by the recipient, just as written notice is received even if not read or acknowledged. This applies traditional common law theories to electronic commerce. In electronic transactions,
                        automated systems can send and react to messages without human intervention. A rule that demands human assent would add an inefficient and error prone element or inappropriately cede control to one party.

                            Idea Submissions: General Premise. This section deals in a limited way with an important issue in information industries: submissions of ideas. It section leaves undisturbed doctrines dealing with equitable remedies, but clarifies contract law. Subsection
                            (a) pertains to unsolicited submissions and to the effect of express submission procedures. Subsection (b) pertains to standards for enforcement of idea submission agreements, whether express or implied.

                            Idea Submissions:  No Prior Agreement. Subsection (a) deals with submissions not pursuant to a prior agreement. Subsection (a)(1) states an obvious contract law principle. If the submission was not solicited, mere receipt of the submission does not create
                            a contract. The receiving party may have an obligation to return copies in some cases, but unilateral action of one party cannot impose obligations in contract on the recipient. Of course, simply because an idea or information
                            is solicited does not mean that there is an agreement or a contract with respect to that submission. The absence of a contract is clear where, for example, a party merely maintains a website inviting clients and licensees to
                            contact it but not indicating an obligation to pay or otherwise compensate for ideas received.

                            Idea Disclosure. Subsection (b) deals with the classic circumstance in which implied in fact contracts might arise. An agreement to disclose an idea carries with it, in the absence of contrary terms, the assumption that the idea has value or uniqueness.
                            That value exists if the idea is concrete, confidential and novel. If, for example, there is an agreement for a party to submit an idea for enhancing the success of audiovisual works in return for a fee, the agreement is not
                            an enforceable contract if the idea is “draw more attractive images.” This rule adopts majority view and cases such as Oasis Music Inc. v. 100 USA, Inc., 614 N.Y.S.2d 878 (N.Y. 1994); Smith v. Rerion Corp., 541 P.2d 663 (Nev.
                            1975); Burgess v. Coca-Cola Co., 55 U.S.P.Q.2d 1506 (Ga. App. 2000). The recipient cannot recover payments it already made. Rather, the default rule is that the provider of the non-novel submission cannot enforce any future
                            obligations as to the submitted idea. The basic principle is that a non-novel idea is not adequate consideration for a contract and that a proponent of an idea implicitly represents that the idea has value. This is not met
                            in a case of an idea that is not concrete, confidential and novel. Of course, however, if the receiving party expressly agreed that it would pay regardless of the nature of the idea, the default rule stated in subsection (b)
                            is over-ridden by that express agreement.

                            Trade Secret and Other Confidential Disclosures. The rule stated in subsection (b) applies to idea submissions. It does not apply to ordinary commercial cases involving confidential disclosures of trade secret or other information. The formation and enforcement
                            of such contracts is under general contract formation law and, when applicable, trade secret law. The Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition suggests that, for purposes of tort claims (e.g., misappropriation law), the doctrines
                            that have developed in many states relating to idea submissions should be brought within trade secret law. This Act does not deal with that issue. It expressly preserves trade secret and similar law, leaving unaffected any
                            controversy that this Restatement suggestion might engender. The rules here deal only with contract law and follow the widely accepted majority rule with respect to idea submissions.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        As indicated in subsection (a)(2), this is true even if the industry in which the recipient functions ordinarily relies on ideas. Contracts only arise by agreement by the parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For purposes of this section, an idea is not solicited simply because the recipient maintains a general interactive customer contact and information site at which clients and licensees may supply information, complaints or suggestions about its products.
                        An idea or information is solicited if the recipient has specifically requested information from another party on a particular topic with some undertaking to pay for such solicited submission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a)(3) acknowledges the common practice of establishing a method for receiving and reacting to submissions as a means of controlling risk and giving guidance. Under this subsection, these procedures have impact in contract law if the submitting
                        party is notified that they exist. Undisclosed procedures are not relevant to a contract analysis. If the submitting party is notified of the procedure, decisions about acceptance or rejection of the submission are funneled through
                        that procedure or, in the case of acceptance, an express decision to accept. This protects both parties. The submitter and the recipient receive the benefit of a more specific set of choices about taking on a contract or rejecting
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This principle does not require that the idea rise to the level of novelty as that term is used in patent law. Cases on combination secrets and other situations in trade secret law where information has sufficient uniqueness or secrecy to qualify as a
                        trade secret should inform decisions under this standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nothing in this section precludes enforcement of an agreement for idea submission that does not hinge on the uniqueness of the proposed submission. In deciding whether such agreement exists, a court must consider the fundamental notion that a party does
                        not implicitly contract away its rights, without a fee, to use information which is not novel, confidential and concrete merely because it contracted for “disclosure” of such material.

                            Record as Final Expression. The basic principle is that an agreed record of the contract is the best and primary source determining the terms of the agreement of the parties.  This section excludes evidence of other alleged terms or agreements that contradict
                            the terms of a record intended as a final expression of the agreement with respect to the terms covered in the record or with respect to terms on which confirmatory records agree. The record need not be intended as the only
                            statement of the agreement on all terms, but to have this rule apply it must be intended as final on the terms covered.

                            Practical Construction. Paragraph (1), however, makes admissible evidence of course of dealing, usage of trade, and course of performance to explain or supplement the terms of any record stating the agreement of the parties. This does not depend on a
                            prior determination that the language of the record is ambiguous.  Instead, these sources of interpretation are allowed in order to reach an accurate understanding of the parties’ intent as to their agreement. Records of an
                            agreement are to be read on the assumption that the course of prior dealings between the parties and the usage of trade were taken for granted when the record was drafted. Unless negated by the record, they are an element of
                            the meaning of the words used. Similarly, the course of actual performance by the parties may be the best indication of what the parties intended the record to mean.

                            Consistent Additional Terms. Under paragraph (2), consistent additional terms not in the record may be proved unless the court finds that the record was intended by both parties as a complete and exclusive statement of all the terms.  This rejects the
                            view that any record that is final on some terms should be, without more, treated as final on all terms of the agreement. On the other hand, if alleged additional terms are such that given the circumstances of the transaction,
                            if agreed upon, they would certainly have been included in the record of the agreement, evidence about the alleged terms must be kept from the trier of fact under this standard.

                            Language. This section rejects the premise that the language used in a record necessarily has the meaning attributable to such language by rules of construction existing in the law rather than the meaning that arises out of the commercial context in which
                            it was used.  See Section 302 [§ 59.1-503.2].

                    <p>
                        An alleged term or agreement is contradictory if its substance cannot reasonably coexist with the substance of the terms of the record. Thus, an alleged term that calls for completion of a software project on July 1 contradicts a term of a record calling
                        for completion on June 10. The two terms cannot reasonably coexist as part of the same agreement. On the other hand, an alleged term that specifies the processing capacity of the software does not contradict the terms of a record
                        that does not make reference to that issue. Of course, the fact that the term does not contradict the record means only that evidence of it can be admitted. It does not indicate whether the alleged term was actually agreed by the
                        parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This rule does not preclude proof of subsequent modifications of the agreement. What is excluded is evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements that are not in the record. Subsequent modification may be shown by appropriate evidence. Terms of the
                        original record may restrict what subsequent modification may be proven or effective, such as by requiring that all modifications be in an authenticated record. Section 303 [§ 59.1-503.3].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In many cases, evidence of the parties’ intent about the exclusive nature of the record of their agreement will be provided in the record itself. Particularly in commercial agreements, it is common to include a merger clause stating that the record is
                        intended by both parties as a complete and exclusive expression of the terms of the contract. Under the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Law, merger clauses are conclusive on the issue of intent. As a practical matter,
                        a merger clause in a negotiated commercial contract creates a strong, nearly conclusive presumption that both parties intended the record to be the exclusive statement of their agreement. The merger clause does not preclude a court
                        from using course of dealing, usage of trade or course of performance to understand the meaning of contract terms, but does place a difficult burden on the party seeking to establish that additional terms exist. Even in a commercial
                        case, however, the presumption can be shown to be inappropriate if the record itself refers to terms contained in or documented by material extraneous to the purportedly exclusive record. Of course, records that contain a merger
                        clause but refer to other documents may still reflect an intent to be exclusive if the statement of what represents the aggregate exclusive statement of agreement includes all documents intended to be aggregated, including the
                        referenced external documents.

                            Construction based on Performance. This section adopts the premise that the parties themselves know best what they meant by the words of their agreement and that their actions under that agreement are an important indication of that meaning.  Behavior,
                            of course, is subordinate to express contract terms. However, course of performance as well as usage of trade and course of dealing provide factors useful in determining the meaning of the “agreement.”

                            Nature of Course of Performance. A course of performance requires repeated performance by one party known to the other, an opportunity for the other to object, and a pattern of acceptance or acquiescence by that other party. Since it provides a basis
                            for understanding the parties’ agreement, the events creating it must have mutual elements. Unilateral conduct unknown to the other party, such as use of information beyond the terms of a license, cannot establish a course
                            of performance.  Similarly, a single act does not fall within this concept, although a single event may affect the parties’ rights in other respects.

                            Relationship to Waiver. A pattern of conduct may provide insight into the meaning of the agreement or represent a waiver of a term.  The preference in this Act is in favor of a “waiver” (if the elements of waiver are present) whenever this construction
                            is reasonable because this interpretation preserves the flexible character of commercial contracts and prevents surprise or other hardship.  This is true because a waiver can be retracted as to future performance.  See Sections
                            702 [§ 59.1-507.2]; 303 [§ 59.1-503.3] Comment 5. In contrast, treating a pattern of conduct as providing a binding interpretation of the agreement results in specifying a meaning that cannot be unilaterally retracted by a
                            party.

                            Order of Interpretation. Subsection (a) sets out the order of preference among express terms, course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade. Express terms of an agreement always govern.  Course of performance and course of dealing are the
                            next preferred, respectively, because each relates to the behavior of the particular parties.  These all supersede the default rules of this Act.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with modifications of contracts and agreed limits on the ability to modify.  It is subject to Section 304 [§ 59.1-503.4] on changes made pursuant to contract terms allowing changes. The section generally follows
                            Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209 (1998 Official Text), but makes various changes and moves provisions on the relationship between attempted modification and waiver to Section 702 [§ 59.1-507.2]. On the relationship between this
                            and terms presented for later agreement, see Section 208 [§ 59.1-502.8], Official Comment 4.

                            Role of Contract Modifications. Subsection (a) makes modifications of contracts effective without regard to any lack of consideration. The modification must be in an agreement and there must be assent by both parties. As in Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209
                            (1998 Official Text), there is no requirement that a modification be proposed in good faith. A court should not be asked to accept or invalidate an agreed modification based on its view of the fairness of the commercial motivations
                            of the party proposing the modification or whether the agreement is fair.  The fact that there must be agreement protects against overreaching and abuse, allowing courts to apply ordinary concepts related to fraud or duress
                            when appropriate.

                            Contract Terms Prohibiting Oral Modification. Under subsection (b), a contract term that bars modification or rescission of an agreement except in an authenticated record is enforceable. See Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209 (1998 Official Text). This type
                            of contract term has great importance in commercial relationships especially in contracts involving ongoing performances. Contractually preventing modifications that are not in an authenticated record plays an important role
                            in preventing false allegations of oral modifications, difficulties of establishing terms, and avoiding circumvention of express agreements by alleged modifications. For example, a term that provides “no modification without
                            a signed writing” precludes modification of an agreement by a later mass-market license not signed by the licensee.  Morgan Laboratories, Inc. v. Micro Data Base Systems, Inc., 1997 WL 258886, 41 U.S.P.Q.2d 1850 (N.D. Cal.
                            1997). Such terms permit parties to make their own statute of frauds that controls their risk of oral or other unsigned modifications. The language of the contract term controls, but the presumption should be that electronic
                            records and signatures are included within contractual terms that generally refer to signatures or writings.  However, if a term of a contract limits modifications to a “written signature on paper,” an electronic record or
                            an electronic authentication is not sufficient.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a03s59.1-503.3-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Statute of Frauds. Under subsection (c), the contract as allegedly modified and the modification itself must satisfy the statute of frauds and Section 307(f) [§ 59.1-503.7(f)] to be enforceable.  This prevents unfounded claims of oral modification that
                            alter the contract in a way that derogates Section 201(a) [§ 59.1-502.1(a)] or Section 307(f) [§ 59.1-503.7(f)]. Thus, the alleged modification cannot, without an authenticated record, transform a $6,000 two-year license of
                            computer information into a perpetual license, nor can it alter the subject matter of a license for a multi-media product to include an entirely different subject matter. On the other hand, a modification that changes the delivery
                            date without altering the term or subject matter, need not be in an authenticated record if the original agreement was in such a record. In that case, the original record suffices under Sections 201 and 307 [§§ 59.1-502.1 and
                            59.1-503.7] as to the modified contract.

                            Waiver. A party whose conduct is inconsistent with a contract term may place itself in a position from which it may no longer assert that term until it gives notice to the other party that it intends to do so. That principle of waiver is discussed in
                            Section 702 [§ 59.1-507.2] and applies to contract terms requiring a signed record for modification. But waiver occurs only if the conduct induced the other party reasonably and in good faith to rely and that reliance precludes
                            changing the position as to past conduct or as to future conduct unless steps are taken to cut off reasonable reliance on the waiver as to the future.  See Autotrol Corp. v. Continental Water Systems, 918 F.2d 689, 692 (7th
                            Cir. 1990); Wisconsin Knife Works v. National Metal Crafters, 781 F.2d 1280 (7th Cir. 1986). Reasonableness of such behavior, of course, must be considered in light of the circumstances, including the fact of a “no waiver”
                            clause. Courts should be slow to find waiver of anti-waiver provisions in general and “no-oral modification” clauses in particular.   See 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code
                            <cite class="ocva">
         <a href="gov.va.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-6" target="_blank">
          1-6
         </a>
        </cite> , pp. 41-42 (4th Ed. 1995).  With “no-oral modification” clauses, it is more likely that the conduct constitutes a waiver of the substantive term for a particular performance, rather than of the “no-oral-modification”
                            clause itself which would open up the entire contract based on behavior affecting one part. That interpretation is consistent with Section 302 [§ 59.1-503.2], preferring a waiver analysis over a modification analysis in close
                            cases.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) adopts the policy of Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209 (1998 Official Text) that in consumer transactions such terms are enforceable only if the consumer assents specifically to the term. U.C.C. Article 2 requires a consumer to sign the term.
                        This Act substitutes the requirement of manifesting assent to better fit electronic commerce. The limitation in subsection (b) does not apply to a transaction that is not a consumer transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Partial performance under the original agreement validates the original agreement, but if the modification alters subject matter, duration, scope, price or other significant terms, that partial performance does not validate the modified contract. If the
                        contract as modified does not satisfy the statute of frauds, the original agreement that did satisfy Section 201 [§ 59.1-502.1] constitutes the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The modifications must also satisfy any other applicable rules limiting the effectiveness of agreed terms. Thus, disclaimers of warranties must meet conform to the disclaimer rules and modifications of scope must comply with Section 307 [§ 59.1-503.7].

                            the terms than are required in common law.  If parties agree that changes can be made pursuant to a specified procedure and the provisions of this subsection are met, the changes made in good faith pursuant to that procedure

                            Changes in Content. This section deals with changes in contract terms and does not cover changes in content available under an access contract. In an access contract, the access right is to materials as changed by the licensor over time unless the agreement
                            otherwise expressly provides. A decision to add, modify, or delete a database or a part of a database does not modify the contract, but merely constitutes the performance of the licensor and is not within this subsection.

                        First, contract terms cover all performances under the contract whenever the agreement extends to subsequent performances. A warranty disclaimer in a contract for ongoing use of a website applies to all subsequent uses of the site pursuant to that contract.
                        Of course, if each separate access involves a separate access contract, the terms of the first agreement do not cover the second, absent express agreement that it does so.

                    <p>
                        Second, contract terms can be changed pursuant to procedures established by the contract. The procedures might relate to actions of a third party (e.g., changes in applicable government regulation), to an external standard (e.g., a price index), or to
                        changes implemented by a party pursuant to an agreed procedure. Performance under a contractual right to change terms is subject to the duty of good faith. The affirmative principle is that, in a commercial agreement, if parties
                        agree to a procedure by which terms can be altered, they are bound by that agreement and changes made pursuant to that agreed procedure are binding unless the proposal violates standards of good faith, including commercial fair
                        dealing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subsection addresses important practices in online and other contracts, such as outsourcing agreements, where there is a need to efficiently modify terms over time. It does not alter agreements or consent orders which limit or expand the ability to
                        make changes in an ongoing contract. This subsection deals only with agreed terms that permit changes to be made. It does not create a unilateral right to change terms if the parties have not agreed to an applicable procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contract terms allowing procedures for changes are the converse of contractual provisions restricting modification other than in an authenticated record. They are analogous to cases in which an agreement leaves the particulars of performance to be specified
                        by one party. They are enforceable under Section 305 [§ 59.1-503.5] and under U.C.C. Article 2. The need for enforceability of such changes is especially important in electronic commerce because this area of commerce is subject
                        to evolving and unpredictable rules and circumstances that may require adjustment of performance, risk allocation, and other characteristics of a relationship. The requirement that the change be made in good faith requires that
                        the change occur in a manner consistent with commercial standards of fair dealing; this prevents the party making the change from taking undue advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • it is proposed in good faith, which includes meeting standards of commercial fair dealing;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • it is proposed pursuant to an agreed procedure;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • the procedure reasonably notifies the other party of the change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, since this Act preserves substantive consumer statutes (Section 105 [§ 59.1-501.5]), if a consumer statute specifies a method for notice of changes, this Act does not displace that rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b)(1) requires that the procedure reasonably notify the other party of the change. What constitutes reasonable notification depends on the commercial circumstances and general commercial standards of practice with respect to that circumstance.
                        Posting at an agreed location designated for that purpose would ordinarily suffice as commercially reasonable notification. While there is no requirement that individual changes be separately singled out for special affirmative
                        notice, such may be appropriate under this standard for material changes such as a change in price. Often, reasonable notification requires action before the change is effective, but in some emergency situations, notice that coincides
                        with the change or follows it is sufficient (e.g., blocking access to a virus infected site or a change in access codes to prevent third party intrusions). A procedure for posting changes in a designated, accessible location will
                        ordinarily suffice. The overall context of the contract must be considered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section does not require that there be a right to withdraw from the contract in commercial, non-mass-market transactions. This is because, in cases such as outsourcing agreements or other ongoing commercial relationships, the blanket requirement
                        of a withdrawal right cannot meet the varied and important commercial circumstances that might arise. For example, in some cases, the services provider makes extensive financial commitments in based on a multiyear contract term
                        and requiring that a withdrawal right exist in those situations would seriously disrupt commercial expectations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to withdraw must be without penalty, but the licensee must, of course, perform the contract prior to the date of withdrawal (e.g., pay all sums due). In many licenses that entail continuing performance, the contract may be subject to termination
                        at will. Subsection (b) does not alter that rule or the rights of either party under it.

                            Scope of Section. This section follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-311 (1998 Official Text). It deals with contracts in which one party reserves or is granted the right to specify terms after the agreement. On the relationship between this and terms presented
                            for later agreement, see Section 208, Official Comment 4.

                            Enforceability. This section is an express recognition of one form of layered contracting in which terms are established after the initial agreement, rather than at the time of initial agreement.  If the initial agreement is sufficiently definite to form
                            a contract, this section allows parties to leave particulars of performance to be filled in by a party without running the risk of having the contract invalidated for indefiniteness.  The party empowered to specify the missing
                            details is required to exercise good faith and to act in accordance with commercial standards so that there is no surprise; the range of permissible specifications is limited by what is commercially reasonable.

                            Conditions. Paragraph (2) applies when specification by one party is necessary to or materially affects the other party’s performance, but is not seasonably made.  The section excuses the other party’s resulting delay in performance.  The hampered party
                            may perform in any reasonable manner, suspend its performance, or treat the other person’s failure as a breach of contract.  These rights are in addition to all other remedies available under the contract or this Act.  This
                            includes the right to demand reasonable assurances of performance because the delay caused insecurity.  The request for assurances may also be premised on the obligation of good faith established in this section, which obligation
                            may imply the need for a reasonable indication of the time and manner of performance for which the other party is to hold itself ready.

                        The agreement that permits one party to specify terms may be found in a course of dealing, usage of trade, implication from the circumstances or in explicit language used by the parties. Thus, acquisition of information through a telephone order where
                        there is reason to know that terms to be provided by the other party will indicate details of the contractual arrangement may fall within this section. Supplied under this section, the details supplied are bounded by trade use
                        and commercial expectations (as well as by the terms actually agreed by the parties). They do not, however, require that the other party agree to the terms since, by definition, the original agreement constitutes assent to the
                        later terms under the limitations described here.

                            Commercial Context. Interpretation of contracts must be based on the commercial context.  If the agreement or this Act does not provide content for a term left open by the parties, a court must adopt a standard that is reasonable in light of the commercial
                            circumstances. This rule applies only if there is no contract term.  Agreement may be found in express language or in usage of trade or course of dealing. This section does not allow a court to add or alter agreed terms. See

                            Lack of Contract. This section does not apply if the parties do not intend an agreement.  If a term is left open because there was no agreement on the term and the intent of the parties precludes a contract unless or until that agreement occurs, Section
                            202(e) [§ 59.1-502.2(e)] applies.

                        What is reasonable in context depends on the nature, purpose and circumstances of the action to be taken or avoided and on the entire commercial context of the agreement. If the reasonableness standard applies, a party is not required to fix, at peril
                        of breach, a performance that is in fact reasonable in the unforeseeable judgment of a later trier of fact. Under general requirements of good faith, effective communication by one party to the other of a proposed time limit or
                        other interpretation of a reasonable performance calls for a response so that a failure to reply in a timely manner creates an inference of acquiescence to the proposal. If the recipient of the proposal objects or if no proposal
                        is made, a demand for assurance on the ground of insecurity may be made pending further negotiation. Only if a party insists on undue delay or unreasonable performance or rejects the other party’s commercially reasonable proposal
                        does a question of breach arise.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals with interpretation of a license, establishing the basic premise that a license should be interpreted in a commercially reasonable manner and providing several specific interpretation rules that reflect commercial
                            practice.

                            License Grant. Subsection (a) provides that as a matter of interpretation a license gives the contractual rights expressly granted and, in appropriate cases, limited implied rights to the extent necessary to use the expressly granted rights in the information.
                            A license of software expressly allowing the licensee to create visual presentations for use in public speaking incorporates a right to publicly display images from the software in such presentations because that right is necessary
                            to the expressly granted right.  On the other hand, under both copyright law and this section, a contract granting a right to publish a work as part of a particular compilation does not convey any implied right to reproduce
                            that work in another medium or form.  See Tasini v. The New York Times Co., Inc., — U.S. — (2001). Also, the implied rights apply only to rights within the control of the licensor at the time of the contracting. For example,
                            a license to use a photograph in a digital product implies a right to transform that photograph into digital form assuming that this right was within the licensor’s control at the time the contract was made.

                            Exceeding the Grant. Subsection (b) resolves the interpretation of a license that gives the licensee a right “to do X” when the licensee does an act that exceeds or differs from “X.”  When the contract limit is express, as in stating a right “only to
                            do X”, actions different from the expressly limited grant are a breach.  This refers to the grant as interpreted, including consideration of course of dealing and usage of trade.  When the license is less explicit, subsection
                            (b) provides that there is an implied limitation that the licensee will not use the information other than as described in the contract and subsection (a). Uses outside these terms are a breach. This rejects case law that requires
                            express limiting language for this result, such as requiring a license to state that the licensee may “only do X”.  If the word “only” or its equivalent does not appear, some patent cases hold that uses not covered by the grant
                            infringe the patent, but may not breach the license. As a matter of contract law, a rule that hinges on the use or failure to use the word “only” provides a trap that is avoided in subsection (b) by adopting the ordinary understanding
                            that an affirmative grant implicitly excludes uses that exceed or are not otherwise within the grant.

                            Improvements and Design Material. Under subsections (c) and (d), unless the contract clearly indicates otherwise, neither party has a right to receive subsequent modifications or improvements made by the other, or a right of access to design and confidential
                            material. Arrangements for such material as modifications, improvements, source code or designs entail separate relationships handled by express contract terms.  In the absence of express terms, the contract gives no rights
                            to such material to either party.  This contract law principle does not, of course, supplant intellectual property rules on derivative works. Section 105(a) [§ 59.1-501.5(a)].

                            Grant Clauses. Subsection (e) states that ordinary commercial contract principles apply to interpreting a license grant.  As a state law rule, of course, it is subject to contrary federal policy which, some courts hold, requires interpretation of a grant
                            in favor of the licensor. See Comment No. 2 above.

                        This subsection does not create an implied license, but merely states a reasonable commercial interpretation of a contract. It can be over-ridden by the agreement. Also, the implied rights pertain only to information and material provided to the licensee.
                        They do not require that the licensor transfer additional materials (such as source code) unless that transfer was agreed by the parties. The rights must be necessary and not merely convenient to enable the express grant. They
                        do not include rights merely because the licensee desired them, merely because the rights pertain to uses made possible by possession of a copy, or merely common or even helpful rights, unless such rights are necessary to utilize
                        the expressly granted rights. Express terms creating greater rights or lesser rights, of course, override this subsection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) expresses a contract law interpretive rule. Some cases hold that federal policy requires interpretation of a license against the licensee and in a manner that withholds any use not expressly granted. SOS, Inc. v. Payday, Inc., 886 F.2d
                        1084 (9th Cir. 1989). The better view is that expressed in cases such as
                        <i>
        Bourne v. Walt Disney Co.,
       </i> 68 F.3d 621 (2d Cir. 1995), which treat interpretation as an ordinary commercial contract question. Of course, to the extent a mandatory federal policy precludes different state law, that policy overrides subsection
                        (a). Section 105(a) [§ 59.1-501.5(a)].

                    <p>
                        The implied limitation, however, does not yield a breach if the use would have been permitted by law in the absence of the limitation. Thus, scholarly use of a quotation from licensed material not subject to trade secrecy restraints, if a fair use under
                        federal law, would not conflict with the implied limitation. However, a licensee that does something that is not included in that grant and that is not protected such as by fair use breaches the contract. A license for use in Peoria
                        implies the lack of a right to do so in Detroit, just as a contractual right to use information for 100 users implies a lack of a right to use it for 101 or more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) provide guidance on important license terms. Subsection (e)(1) establishes a uniform rule on when a grant covers future technologies and rights. Use of statutory or similar language that creates a broad scope without qualification
                        should be sufficient to cover any and all rights as well as present and future media (such as print, television, on-line and other modes of distribution). This is subject to other rules in this Act, including for example, the premise
                        that the licensee does not receive any rights in enhancements made by the licensor unless the contract expressly so provides. The interpretation rule does not encourage or discourage use of such broad grants, but merely gives guidance
                        on what language achieves what result when agreed by the parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (e)(2) clarifies that an exclusive license that does not otherwise deal with the issue, conveys exclusive rights that include restrictions on the licensor. The licensor may not license or itself use the information within the scope of the exclusive
                        license, and affirms that it has not granted any other subsisting license covering the same scope and will not grant any future license covering the same scope that takes effect during the duration of the exclusive license. This
                        Act does not change the definition of what is an “exclusive license” for copyright law recordation purposes, it merely deals with the interpretation given to a contract that provides that it is an exclusive license.

                            Scope of Section. This section deals only with cases where the agreement provides that the acceptability of a required performance is to be judged based on the satisfaction of the party receiving the performance (e.g., where the parties agreed to a “to
                            the satisfaction” clause). This often occurs in licenses where a work is to appeal to aesthetic sensibilities or taste.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a03s59.1-503.9-officialcomment.1ol12">
                            Basic Rule. Subsection (a) follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 228. Contract terms that define acceptability in terms of “to the satisfaction” of a party are ordinarily interpreted as requiring an objective or reasonable person standard. Refusal
                            is not allowed if the tender would be acceptable to a reasonable person. This rule is supplemented by the general obligation of good faith that applies to all contracts.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a03s59.1-503.9-officialcomment.1ol13">
                            Subjective Standard. As subsection (b) indicates, there are cases where a subjective standard of satisfaction is appropriate. The most obvious is when the contract so states. Subsection (b)(1) provides language that indicates a subjective satisfaction
                            standard. Of course, the agreement may expressly reject a subjective standard and that agreement would control.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b)(2) presumes a subjective standard if the contract involves informational content evaluated on aesthetics, appeal, or the like. See Locke v. Warner Brothers, Inc., 66 Cal. Rptr.2d 921 (Cal. App. 1997). (Under California law the applicable
                        standard is that it is to be to the “honest satisfaction” of the party). As the subsection makes clear, this refers to cases where evaluation reflects subjective criteria and judgment. A reasonable person standard in such cases
                        is nonsensical since the nature of the required evaluation presumes the exercise of personal judgment.

                                    Party Making the Warranty. When the computer information is part of the normal business subject matter with which the licensor deals and is provided in the normal course of its business, it is the licensor’s obligation to see that no third party claim
                                    of infringement of an intellectual property right or of misappropriation will affect the delivered information. As in Article 2, however, a transfer by a person other than a dealer in information of the kind raises
                                    no implication of such a warranty.

                                    Delivered Free of Infringement. Subsection (a) requires delivery free of rightful claim of infringement or misappropriation.  The mere assertion of a claim does not breach this warranty; the claim must be valid.  As in Uniform Commercial Code Section
                                    2-312 (1998 Official Text), the warranty refers to circumstances and claims existing as the information exists at delivery.  This does not cover future events, such as a subsequently issued patent, or extend to use
                                    of the information, such as infringement claims resulting from a licensee’s decision to use multi-functional software in a manner that is an infringing use, or to combine the licensed information with other information
                                    where the composite infringes a third party right. Chemtron, Inc. v. Aqua Products, Inc., 830 F. Supp. 314 (E.D. Va. 1993) and Motorola v. Varo, Inc., 656 F. Supp. 716 (N.D. Tex. 1986) frame the issue correctly.  For
                                    example, in a license of a spreadsheet program, the warranty is that the program itself does not infringe another person’s rights, not that uses of the program that may involve employing the program’s capability to
                                    create particular functions will not infringe the rights of another. See, e.g., Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc.. v. West Pub. Co., 158 F.3d 693 (2d Cir. 1998) (no infringement even if program could be used to recreate
                                    copyrighted work).  Under Section 805 [§ 59.1-508.5], the limitations period for breach begins when breach was or should have been discovered, rather than on tender of delivery of the information.

                                    Patent License. Subsection (c)(3) makes the subsection (a) warranty inapplicable to patent licenses.  This refers to a party licensing a patent per se.  Most such patent licenses are not within this Act, but if the license is within this Act, subsection
                                    (c) adopts the prevailing rule in patent licensing: a patent license does not warrant that the licensee can use the licensed technology, but merely affirms that the licensor will not sue for use of its rights.  On the
                                    other hand, if a party licenses computer information, the subsection (a) warranty is breached if the information as delivered infringes a third party patent.  If a licensor gives a license to the patent itself, subsection
                                    (a) does not apply.

                                    Specifications and Hold Harmless. No warranty from the licensor is implied when the licensee orders computer information to be assembled, prepared, designed or manufactured on the licensee’s detailed specifications and methods; in such cases liability
                                    runs from the licensee to the licensor. There is an implicit representation by the licensee that the licensor will be safe in following the detailed specifications and method that the licensee requires. See Bonneau
                                    Co. v. AG Industries, Inc., 116 F.3d 155 (5th Cir. 1997) (rule under Article 2).

                                    Non-Infringement and Passive Transmission. The warranty in subsection (a) is only made by licensors of information.  It does not apply to persons who provide communications or transmission services even if such service falls within this Act.  Those service
                                    providers do not, for purpose of contract law, engage in activities that reasonably create the inference that they assure the absence of infringing information. That obligation could be expressly undertaken by the contract
                                    but is not created by this Act. This Act takes no position and has no effect on what constitutes copyright infringement in such situations. Whether a party is a licensor of information for contract law depends on its
                                    position with respect to affirmatively providing the information as part of its ordinary business.  This has no bearing on whether a passive transmission provider is liable for infringement to the owner of intellectual
                                    property rights.

                            Interference Warranty. The warranty of quiet possession was abolished in Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 for sales of goods but reestablished in Uniform Commercial Code Article 2A for leases of goods. Paragraph (b)(1) follows Article 2A.  It creates
                            a warranty that no act or omission of the licensor will result in a third party holding a claim (other than infringement) that interferes with enjoyment by the licensee of its contractual interest.  “Enjoyment” refers to authorized
                            exercise of contract rights in use of the information.  The warranty is limited to interfering claims or interests that arise from the licensor’s acts or omissions. As in Article 2A, this limitation enables the licensor to
                            assess risks. Infringement and misappropriation claims are excluded because they are dealt with in subsection (a).  The warranty reflects that the nature of a license  results in a need of the licensee for protection greater
                            than that afforded to a buyer of goods. The warranty represents a tacit commitment by the licensor that it will not act during the duration of the contract in a manner that detracts from the contractual grant. Under Section
                            805 [§ 59.1-508.5], the limitations period for breach begins when delivery of the information is tendered, not when breach was or should have been discovered. This follows U.C.C. Article 2-312 (1998 Official Text, Comment 2)
                            (breach of warranty of good title occurs when tender of delivery is made since the warranty is not one which extends to future performance).

                            Exclusivity. Subsection (b)(2) deals with exclusive licenses. When a license purports to be exclusive, it engenders two implied assurances that are not relevant for non-exclusive licenses. The first concerns the validity of the intellectual property rights.
                            An exclusive licensor warrants that the rights conveyed are not in the public domain.  If this condition is not met, the licensor cannot convey exclusive rights.  The second involves whether a portion of the rights covered
                            by the license are vested in another person because co-authors or co inventors were involved, or a prior license exists. In an exclusive license, the licensor implicitly warrants that this is not true. The reasoning on both
                            points is similar: if the implied circumstances are not present, the meaning of “exclusivity” is altered. A similar concern does not exist for non-exclusive licenses because such a condition does not alter the licensee’s ability
                            to use the licensed rights as described.

                            International Issues. Intellectual property rights extend only within the territory of the jurisdiction that creates them, although some deference internationally occurs through multi-lateral treaties. Subsection (c)(2) provides that implied exclusivity
                            and infringement warranties extend only within this country and a country specifically mentioned in the warranty. This latter extension refers to statements made with express reference to the warranty, such as “Licensor warrants
                            non-infringement worldwide.”  Other references in a license may not be intended to create a warranty. A grant of a license for worldwide use may be no more than a permission to use the information worldwide without lawsuit
                            by the licensor, rather than a warranty that worldwide use will not infringe others rights.  In the case of a “worldwide warranty,” the obligation extends only to countries that have intellectual property rights treaties with
                            the United States. In the absence of such relationships, rights created under United States law cannot create rights in the other country and, thus, it is assumed that the parties did not intend it to extend there.

                            Disclaimer. Subsection (d) derives from U.C.C. § 2-312 (1998 Official Text) and goes further to provide illustrative language for disclaimer of the licensee’s hold harmless obligation.  The infringement and other warranties in this section are not implied
                            warranties and cannot be disclaimed except as provided in this Section.  Under subsection (d), this requires specific language or circumstances indicating that the warranties are not given; illustrative language is provided
                            for clarity. Subsection (d) limits the conditions under which the warranty can be disclaimed or modified; it does not limit or preclude disclaimer or modification of a hold harmless obligation that might arise under subsection
                            (a).

                        The circumstances for this rule do not arise merely because the licensee assists and advises in developing the computer information and even suggests alternative approaches to development. In such cases, the licensor remains in control. More generally,
                        the licensee is entitled to rely on the technical expertise and judgments of the licensor. That is reversed only when the agreement makes clear that the licensee has undertaken to specify what must be done and how it must be done
                        in detail sufficient to eliminate the licensor’s choices. When this occurs, there is a tacit assurance from the licensee that there will be no infringement claim resulting from relying on that mandate. For this rule to apply, then,
                        the specifications and method must be specific or detailed, rather than general, and compliance must be required by contract. The “hold harmless” obligation does not exist if infringement is caused by or arises out of optional
                        choices of the licensor that may result in infringement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A licensor presented with required specifications and methods has an obligation to adopt, or notify the licensee of, non-infringing alternatives of which it has reason to know. The “hold harmless” obligation is eliminated if the licensor had reason to
                        know of a non-infringing alternative and failed either to choose it or notify the licensee of it, such as when an experienced designer of banking systems knows that alteration of a specification would allow use of an alternative
                        that will avoid infringement of a financial systems patent. Only a non-infringing alternative of which the licensor has reason to know is required; the section does not impose a duty of investigation. Reason to know for this purpose
                        must exist at the time that the contract is performed. Since we are dealing with contractually required performance, however, it is enough that the licensee be notified of the non-infringing alternative — the licensor cannot unilaterally
                        rewrite or ignore the contractual requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A special rule governs patents. When the exclusivity warranty applies at all, it is restricted to the licensor’s knowledge. The warranty is inapplicable to patent licenses excluded under subsection (c)(3).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exclusivity and validity are warranted only to the extent recognized in law applicable to the rights in question. Thus, the licensor of a trade secret warrants that it has not granted rights to another person, but does not warrant that no other person
                        independently has the information. A trade secret gives no rights against independent discovery. If no right of publicity is recognized in a particular jurisdiction, then the licensor does not warrant exclusivity there with respect
                        to such rights. Subsection (c)(1) reinforces this theme. If under applicable law, the rights are subject to compulsory licensing, public access or use, the warranty is limited by the terms of those rights. For example, a licensor
                        of rights in information which must be licensed to any and all parties for a specified fee, does not warrant exclusivity. If an exclusive right is limited in law by a privilege granted to public use, such as “fair use,” the licensor
                        does not warrant against such use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (e) recognizes an alternative form of disclaimer in commercial cases. Reference to a grant of a “quitclaim” in this context is relatively common is some areas of business and indicates that the licensor is not undertaking any assurance about
                        the nature or scope of the rights it holds or conveys.

                            Scope and Basis of Section. This section follows Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text), except with respect to published informational content, where it preserves current common law. “Express” warranties rest on “dickered” aspects
                            of the individual bargain and go to the essence of that bargain. “Implied” warranties, on the other hand, rest on inferences from a common factual situation or set of conditions so that no particular language is necessary to
                            create them.  They exist unless disclaimed.

                            Basis of the Bargain. Subsection (a) generally adopts the “basis of the bargain” test from U.C.C. §§ 2-313; 2A-210 (1998 Official Text).  This allows courts and parties to draw on extensive case law distinguishing express warranties from puffing and from
                            other unenforceable statements, representations or promises.  The concept of the “basis of the bargain” standard is that express affirmations or promises are express warranties if they are within the matrix of elements that
                            constitute the bargain of the parties, but that they are not express warranties if they are not part of the basis for the contract.  This does not require that a licensee prove actual reliance on a specific statement in deciding
                            to enter into the contract, but does require proof that the statement played a role in the bargain. The issue is whether statements of the licensor to the licensee have in the circumstances and in objective judgment become
                            part of the basic deal. However, an express warranty concerns a bargain; this does not convert all statements a licensor makes about information into an express warranty.

                            Advertising as an Express Warranty. Paragraph (a)(1) expands current Article 2.  It clarifies that advertising by the licensor may create an express warranty if it otherwise meets the standards for an express warranty under this section.  A warranty exists
                            only if the advertising statement becomes part of the bargain and a bargain between the person making the statement and the person acquiring the product actually occurs. Under this Act, and particularly Section 613 [§ 59.1-506.13],
                            a contract may exist between the end user and a dealer who makes the statement, or, or as well as, separately between the end user and a publisher who makes the statement; neither is responsible for the other’s statement, however.
                            The affirmation of fact in advertising must be known by the licensee, and must influence and in fact become part of the basis of the bargain between the licensee and warrantor and under which the licensee acquired the computer
                            information.  If this does not occur, there is no express warranty.  Also, statements made in advertising that are puffing or mere expressions of opinion do not create an express warranty.  In appropriate cases, there may be
                            liability for false advertising, but that does not arise under contract law.  This section does not create a false advertising claim under the guise of contract law.

                            Descriptions. Paragraph (a)(2) is a specific application of when a description becomes an express warranty.  The description need not be by words. Technical specifications, blueprints and the like can afford more exact descriptions than mere language
                            and, if made part of the basis of the bargain, become express warranties.  Of course, all descriptions by merchants must be read in light of applicable trade usage and in light of concepts about merchantability that may resolve
                            any doubts about the meaning of the description.  The description requires a commercially reasonable interpretation.

                            Samples and Models. Samples, models and demonstrations are treated no differently than statements. However, in mercantile experience, the mere exhibition of a “sample”, a “model” or a “demonstration” does not of itself show whether it is intended to “suggest”
                            or to “be” the character of the subject-matter of the contract.  That distinction is recognized in reported cases and in this Act.

                            Puffing and Expressions of Opinion. Subsection (b) makes it clear that puffing or mere statements of opinion do not form an express warranty.  The law distinguishes between an actionable representation and puffing is well-developed.  The distinction requires
                            a determination based on the circumstances of the particular transaction.  The policy that requires this distinction to be made is that in common experience some statements and predictions cannot fairly be viewed as entering
                            into the bargain.  To hold each party to every statement made would contradict common experience and stifle discourse about products and proposals. Of course, whether or not a statement is an express warranty does not affect
                            whether the statement established a cause of action under the law of fraud or misrepresentation.

                            Relation to Disclaimers. Express warranty rules focus on determining what the licensor agreed to provide. Descriptions of an information product, if made part of the bargain, are express warranties.  If an express warranty is made, the obligations created
                            ordinarily cannot be easily deleted.  A general contract term disclaiming “all warranties, express or implied” is not given literal effect as to express warranties under Section 406(a) [§ 59.1-504.6(a)].  This does not mean
                            that parties cannot make their own bargain, including a bargain that does not include a purported express warranty. But to do so requires that the particular description or promise not become part of the bargain. In determining
                            what was the actual agreement, consideration should be given to the fact that the probability is small that a real price is intended to be exchanged for a pseudo-obligation. For example, a license of a “word-processing program”
                            that contains a general disclaimer of all warranties is nevertheless a contract for a product that satisfies the basic description of a “word-processing program.”

                            Published Informational Content. Subsection (c) preserves current law for published informational content. This section does not change express warranty rules for such content and does not preclude the imposition of any obligation under other law or the
                            creation of an express contractual obligation.  Despite it being law for over fifty years, no reported case law on published informational content uses the Article 2 “basis of the bargain” standard. Joel R. Wolfson, Express

                            and general public policies that favor encouraging public dissemination of information. Courts that deal with liability pertaining to published informational content must balance contract themes with these policies.

                            Electronic Agents. This section does not deal with “representations” made by electronic agents in an automated negotiation.  It deals with representations by a licensor. Human beings, with rich contextual understandings, can often distinguish between
                            “falsity” and “white lies” or “puffing.”  Electronic agents are rarely capable of recognizing the difference. See Stuart Russell &amp; Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (1995).

                        As in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text), no specific intent to make a warranty is necessary if the indicated representations, promises or affirmations are part of the basis of the bargain. In practice, affirmations of fact
                        describing the information and made by the licensor about it during the bargaining are ordinarily part of the bargain unless they are mere puffing, predictions, or otherwise not an enforceable commitment. No specific reliance on
                        the specific statement need be shown in order to weave it into the fabric of the agreement. Of course, when statements are made by an agent, the effect of the representations to bind the principal are governed by ordinary standards
                        about the scope and effect of agency.

                        If language is used after the closing of the deal (as when the licensee on taking delivery asks for and receives an additional assurance), the assurance may become a modification of the contract. An agreed modification requires no consideration to be
                        binding. Section 303 [§ 59.1-503.3]. Alternatively, under the layered contracting recognized in Section 208 and 209 [§§ 59.1-502.8 and 59.1-502.9], in appropriate cases the assurance may be a further elaboration of terms of the
                        contract if the parties, at the outset, had reason to know this would occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of representations created by demonstrations and models must be gauged by what inferences would be communicated to a reasonable person in light of the nature of the demonstration, model, or sample. Showing a sample of a keg of raw beans consisting
                        of a cup-full of beans communicates one inference (most beans will be similar), while demonstration of a complex database program running ten files creates an entirely different inference if the intended use of the system is to
                        process ten million files (the inference is not that actual use will be identical to use of the sample). This difference also applies to beta models of software, which are used on a test or a demonstration basis and may contain
                        elements that are not carried forward into the ultimate product. Ordinarily the parties understand that what is being demonstrated on a small scale or tested on a beta model is not necessarily representative of actual performance
                        or of the eventual product. As with any other purported express warranty, any model or demonstration must be interpreted in a reasonable fashion that reflects the circumstances of the test or demonstration. See NMP Corp. v. Parametric
                        Technology Corp., 958 F. Supp. 1536 (S.D. Okla. 1997). The 2002 amendments deleted a redundancy created by the word “reasonably” without there being any substantive change.

                        Paragraph (b)(2) identifies a common setting where the issue about how to treat a statement arises. It refers to statements or demonstrations pertaining to aesthetics and the appeal (including market appeal) of informational content as a form of puffing
                        or opinion that does not create an express warranty. Aesthetics, as used here, refers to questions of the artistic character, tastefulness or beauty of informational content, not to statements pertaining to how a person uses the
                        informational content or its essential nature. For example, a statement that a clip art program contains useable images of “working people” may create an express warranty that the subject matter of the program includes working
                        people and that the images are usable. Neither the statement, nor a selected display of part of the program creates an express warranty that they are tasteful or artistically pleasing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cases treat obligations for published informational content as questions of express contractual obligation, rather than warranty. A promise to provide an electronic encyclopedia obligates the party to deliver that type of work, but that is simply
                        a matter of defining the basic contractual promise. When focusing on the quality of informational content, most courts conclude that the level of risk vis a vis published informational content and the potentially stifling effect
                        that contract liability might have on the dissemination of speech encourage limiting or excluding liability. See Daniel v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., 520 N.Y.S.2d 334 (N.Y. City Ct. 1987). This section rejects the seemingly simple,
                        but ultimately inappropriate step of merely adopting the basis of the bargain concept from sales of goods to this much different context. However, if a contract obligation is breached with respect to published informational content
                        in a transaction covered under this Act, remedies of this Act apply and replace remedies under the common law. This includes all provisions of Part 8 of this Act [§ 59.1-508.1 et seq.].

                            Scope of the Section. This section adapts the implied warranty of merchantability from Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) to computer programs. This expands the scope of that warranty since, under prior law, in many transactions
                            Article 2 does not apply and there are no other implied warranties. The warranties in subsection (a) arise only if the licensor is in a contractual relationship with the indicated party or if Section 409 [§ 59.1-504.9] so provides.
                            See Section 613 [§ 59.1-506.13], Comment 3(b). Disclaimer or modification of the implied warranty is dealt with in Section 406 [§ 59.1-504.6]. Obligations regarding informational content are in Section 404 [§ 59.1-504.4].

                            Background and Policy. The implied warranty of merchantability comes from one of three different legal traditions associated with computer information transactions. The first , the source of this warranty, is the Article 2 world of the sale of goods and
                            focuses on the quality of the result (product) delivered, establishing an implied assurance that this product will conform to ordinary standards for products of that type.  The second , from common law dealing with licenses,
                            services and information contracts, focuses on the process or performance effort, rather than the result, establishing standards such as that the work will be performed in a workmanlike manner.  The third , from common law,
                            pertains to services and information contracts in some States, rejecting any implied obligation in a contract other than one involving a special relationship of reliance.

                            Merchantability. Merchantability sets out an implied obligation based on expectations about ordinary meanings and ordinary transactions in commerce. The warranty runs between the immediate parties in contractual privity. Under this Act, and particularly
                            Section 613, a contract may exist between the end user and the dealer, or as well as separately between the end user and the publisher. The extent to which persons other than ones in a direct contract relationship with each
                            other receive the benefit of the implied warranty under contract law is discussed in Section 409 [§ 59.1-504.9].

                                    Fit for Ordinary Purposes. In transactions with end users, under subsection (a)(1), the program must be fit for the ordinary purpose for which programs of that description are used. To be fit for ordinary purposes does not require that the program be
                                    the best or most fit for that use or that it be fit for all possible uses. To an extent greater than for goods, computer programs are often adapted and employed in unlimited or inventive ways or ways that go well beyond
                                    the uses for which they were distributed.  The focus of the implied warranty is on the ordinary purposes for which such programs are used. Use of ordinary, mass-market programs in highly sensitive or commercial applications
                                    does not change the warranty into one of fitness for purposes of that use.

                                    Distribution. If the transfer is to a person acquiring the program for re-distribution, the program must be honestly capable of re-distribution. Subsection (a)(2) sets out two criteria under which this can be gauged — adequate packaging and even quality

                                    Labels. Under subsection (a)(3), merchantability includes conformance to descriptions of fact contained on labels or containers, if any.  As under U.C.C. Article 2, this follows from the general obligation of good faith which requires that a licensee
                                    should not be placed in the position of using, or sublicensing  when allowed, information that is mislabeled. With respect to descriptions, the statements must be statement so of fact, not mere puffing.  The implied
                                    warranty arises from facts that often also constitute an express warranty, in which case the rules for express warranties also apply. The meaning of any descriptive statement must be interpreted in light of the commercial
                                    context.

                            Disclaimer. In Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text), the implied warranty of merchantability may be disclaimed pursuant to the fundamental policy that the agreement of the parties controls.  That principle is implemented in Section
                            406 [§ 59.1-504.6].  The right to disclaim is central to the right of a party to determine what it agrees to sell or license and how the parties allocated commercial risks.  The law in some states prohibits disclaimer of implied
                            warranties in consumer cases. This Act does not alter that law. Similarly, although one can disclaim all implied warranties under this Act and under Article 2, disclaimers are ordinarily not effective with respect to express
                            warranties of description or otherwise.

                            Informational Content, Aesthetics. Merchantability does not apply to information intended to be communicated to a human being (“informational content”), including the aesthetics of a product.  This follows case law under the Uniform Commercial Code. Aesthetics
                            refers to questions of the artistic character, tastefulness, beauty or pleasing nature of informational content.  These are matters of personal taste. On the other hand, merchantability can be relevant to whether the computer
                            program is what it purports it to be.  For example if a  claim about images created by a computer program is that they are not attractive or well-executed, merchantability does not apply.  If the complaint is that the program
                            does not function properly and that thus the images are distorted, an issue of merchantability exists. A statement that a clip art program contains images of “horses” gives assurance that the subject matter of the program is
                            horses, but does not purport to state that the images are tasteful or artistically pleasing or whether they are brown, white or green.

                            Cause of Action for Breach. As in other law, in a cause of action for breach of warranty it is necessary to show not only the existence of the warranty, but that the warranty was breached and that the breach was the proximate cause of the loss sustained.
                            In such an action, e.g., in complex computer systems involving different hardware and software, that loss must be caused by defects in the computer program for which breach is claimed.  Proof that losses were not so caused
                            or were caused by events after the program was installed and unconnected to it, operate as a defense here as in other law.

                        This and the following two sections reflect the combined influence of these traditions, making distinctions between computer programs, on the one hand, and information, informational content or services, on the other. The implied merchantability warranty
                        and the warranty in Section 404 [§ 59.1-504.4] pertaining to the accuracy of data may both apply to the same transaction. The one (merchantability) applies to the computer program, while the other (accuracy) applies to the informational
                        content and data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The substantive meaning of the implied warranty turns on the ordinary meaning for the kind of computer program as recognized in the applicable business, trade or industry. As in the Uniform Commercial Code, the implied warranty is made only by all merchant-licensors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Merchantability does not require a perfect program, but only that the subject matter be generally within the average standards applicable in commerce for programs having the particular type of use. The presence of some defects may be consistent with merchantability
                        standards. Uniform Commercial Code § 2-314 (1998 Official Text) explains the concept in terms of “fair average,” i.e., goods that center around the middle of a belt of quality — some may be better and some may be worse, but they
                        cannot all be better and need not all be worse. That approach applies here. While perfection is an aspiration, it is not a requirement of an implied warranty for goods, computer programs or any other property. Indeed, a perfect
                        program may not be possible at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the late 1990’s, a popular operating system program for small computers used by both consumers and commercial licensees contained over ten million lines of code or instructions. In a computer, these instructions interact with each other and with code
                        and operations of other programs. This contrasted with a commercial jet airliner that contained approximately six million parts, many of which involved no interactive function. Of course, the market price of the airliner and the
                        program are materially different. Typical consumer goods contain fewer than one hundred parts and a typical book has fewer than one hundred fifty thousand words. Most computer programs not only have many lines of code, but must
                        utilize and interact with code in third-party programs, further multiplying the possible interactions. It is often literally impossible or commercially unreasonable to guarantee that software of any complexity contains no errors
                        that might cause unexpected behavior or intermittent malfunctions, so-called “bugs.” The presence of minor errors is fully within common expectation. The question for merchantability is not whether errors exist but whether, the
                        program still comes within the middle belt of quality in the applicable trade or industry, i.e., whether it is reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such programs are used in accordance with average levels of quality
                        and reasonable standards of program capability. A great deal of theoretical and practical work is currently focused on techniques to reduce the time and cost needed to determine program “correctness.” Professional standards also
                        exist for software quality evaluation. Commercially reasonable use of existing testing techniques can be one benchmark of whether a computer program is merchantable in law. As industry standards evolve, what constitutes a merchantable
                        program will evolve along with those standards.

                            Accuracy. This warranty is based on the expectation of a person receiving data in a special relationship of reliance that the data are not made inaccurate because of the provider’s lack of reasonable care in performing the contract. The warranty is limited

                            Reliance Relationship. The computer information must be provided by a merchant in a “special relationship of reliance” between the licensor and the licensee. In the absence of such relationship, the mere fact that one person contracts to provides information

                                    Reliance Relationships in General. The requirement of a special relationship of reliance is fundamental to balancing protecting client expectations while not imposing excessive liability risk on informational content providers in a way that might chill
                                    information-providing activities. This stems in part from cases applying Restatement (Second) of Torts § 552. The special element of reliance comes from the relationship itself, a relationship characterized by the provider’s
                                    knowledge that the particular licensee plans to rely on the data in its own business and expects that the provider will tailor the information to its needs. The obligation arises only with respect to persons who possess
                                    unique or specialized expertise and who are in a special position of confidence and trust with the licensee such that reliance on the inaccurate information is justified and the party has a duty to act with care.  See

                            Disclaimer. This section creates a new warranty. The obligation may be disclaimed. Section 406 [§ 59.1-504.6]. See Rosenstein v. Standard and Poor’s Corp., 636 N.E.2d 665 (Ill. App. 1993). Subsection (c) makes clear that disclaimer of the warranty is
                            not subject to the general rule that duties of reasonable care cannot be disclaimed.  See Section 115(a)(1) [§ 59.1-501.15(a)(1)]. That general rule is inapplicable here: what is disclaimed is a warranty related to the accuracy
                            of the content, not the exercise of reasonable care. No duty of reasonable care is created under this section.

                    <p>
                        What constitutes reasonable care depends on the commercial circumstances and the contracted for duties. For example, in a contract to transmit computer information, there is no duty to screen or vouch for accuracy, but merely to avoid a lack of reasonable
                        care in the transmission that causes inaccuracies. A data provider in a context where major loss of human life is possible has a higher degree of care than a provider in other settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The presence of an inaccuracy is also affected by what the data purport to be under the agreement. This section follows cases such as Lockwood v. Standard &amp; Poor’s Corp., 175 Ill.2d 529, 689 N.E.2d 1140, 228 Ill. Dec. 719 (Ill. App. 1997). A contract
                        to estimate the number of users of a product in Houston does not imply an obligation to provide an accurate count, but merely requires an estimate. That estimate, if honestly made, does not breach this warranty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The relationship also requires that the provider make the information available as part of its own business of providing such information. The licensor must be in the business of providing that type of information. This adopts the rationale of cases holding
                        that information provided as part of a differently focused commercial relationship, such as the sale or lease of goods, does not create protected expectations about accuracy except as might be created under express warranty law.
                        A.T. Kearney v. IBM, 73 F.3d 238 (9th Cir. 1997) describes many of the relevant issues. See also

                        A fundamental aspect of a special reliance relationship is that the information provider is specifically aware of, and personally tailors information to the needs of the licensee. A special relationship does not arise for information made generally available
                        to a group in standardized form even if those who subscribe to the information service believe it is relevant to their commercial needs. The information must be personally tailored for the recipient. A special reliance relationship
                        does not require a fiduciary relationship, but does require indicia of special reliance.

                        The implied warranty in this section thus does not apply to published informational content. By definition, such content is information transferred other than in a reliance relationship. Published informational content is informational content made available
                        to the public as a whole or to a range of subscribers on a standardized, not a personally tailored, basis. This includes a variety of commercially important general distribution or subscription services providing informational
                        content such as an Internet web site that lists information about local restaurants, their prices and their quality, as well as services that provide data about current stock or monetary exchange prices to subscribers.

                        A person collecting, summarizing or transmitting third party data as a conduit does not create the same expectations about performance as does a direct information provider. Whatever expectations arise focus on the third party. The third party may not
                        be contractually obligated to the licensee. The conduit’s obligation and the licensee’s reasonable expectations with respect to it do not entail an obligation regarding the accuracy of the third party data. Concerning the policy
                        issues in dealing with conduits, see Zeran v. America On-Line, Inc., 129 F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997). On the related issue of tort liability for publishers who are not authors, see

                            General Approach. Subsection (a) applies when a licensor has reason to know of the licensee’s particular purpose in the transaction and that the licensee is relying on the licensor’s expertise in selecting or developing information suitable for that purpose.
                            The subsection resolves a conflict in case law.  Some cases, relying on Article 2, apply a standard which creates an implied warranty that the product will be suitable to the purpose.  Others, treating a contract as one for
                            services, hold that no enhanced obligation exists unless there are express terms creating it.  This section uses the first standard in some cases but subsection (a)(2) applies a reasonable effort standard for cases where the
                            relationship appears to concern services-like obligations. Under prior law, the decision was based on whether a court viewed the transaction as a sale (result) or services (effort) contract.

                            Warranty of Fitness. Subsection (a)(1) applies to cases analogous to transfers involving products and adopts Uniform Commercial Code § 2-315 (1998 Official Text). Whether or not this warranty arises is a question of fact determined by the circumstances
                            at the time of contracting.  A “particular purpose” differs from the ordinary purpose for which the information is used in that it envisages a specific use by the licensee peculiar to the nature of its business, while the ordinary
                            purposes for which the computer information  is used are contemplated under the concept of merchantability.  Normally, this fitness warranty arises only if the licensor is a merchant with appropriate skill or judgment.

                            Services Warranty. Subsection (a)(2) applies if the transaction more closely resembles services contracts; it applies the type of obligation most appropriate to such cases.  A skilled service provider does not guaranty a result suitable to the other party
                            unless it expressly agrees to do so. Milau Associates v. North Avenue Development Corp., 42 N.Y.2d 482, 398 N.Y.S.2d 882, 368 N.E.2d 1242 (N.Y. 1977).  Subsection (a)(2) provides a standard to determine when a contract calls
                            for services and effort, rather than result.  The test centers on whether the circumstances indicate that the service provider would be paid for time or effort, regardless of the fitness of the result.  Such payment terms typify
                            a services contract. Other factors may also indicate that the parties intended a services obligation as delineated in subsection (a)(2). What constitutes reasonable effort depends on the project and other circumstances of the
                            relationship. Micro Manager, Inc. v. Gregory, 147 Wisc.2d 500, 434 N.W.2d 97 (Wisc. App. 1988).  Subsection (d) makes it clear that this warranty may be disclaimed.  See Comments to Section 404 [§ 59.1-504.4].

                            Aesthetics and Published Information. The warranty does not apply to aesthetics and the like. Subsection (b) repeats a theme of the Act, which is that implied warranties do not apply to the aesthetics of informational content. Aesthetics refers to the
                            artistic character, tastefulness, beauty or pleasing nature of informational content. These are matters of personal taste, rather than elements susceptible to implied warranty.

                            System Integration. Subsection (c) creates a new implied warranty regarding system performance in cases of systems integration contracts. The warranty is that the selected components will function as a system. This does not mean that the system, other
                            than as stated in subsection (a), will meet the licensee’s purposes, that it is an optimal system, or that it will not infringe third party rights. The warranty is merely that the system will functionally operate as a system.
                            Thus, if the agreement requires the licensor to select a computer, printer and five software applications, the warranty is that the five applications will run on the computer selected and that the printer will work with the
                            computer and the software. Whether these components were the best choice or will meet the actual needs of the licensee is not within these subsection (c) warranty.

                            That general rule is inapplicable here: what is disclaimed is a warranty related to the accuracy of the content, not the exercise of reasonable care. No duty of reasonable care is created under this section.

                        The warranty does not exist if there is no reliance in fact or if the particular purposes are not made known to the licensor. For this warranty to arise, the needs of the licensee must have been particularized and the licensor made aware of them, and
                        the licensor must implicitly undertake to fulfill them.

                    <p>
                        No exclusion is made for cases where the information product is identified by a trade name. The designation of an item by a trade name, or indeed in any other definite manner, is only one of the facts to be considered on the question of whether the licensee
                        actually relied on the licensor, but it is not of itself decisive of the issue. If the licensee insists on a particular brand, it is not relying on the licensor’s skill or judgment — and no warranty arises. But the mere fact that
                        the information has a trade name is not sufficient to indicate nonreliance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warranty obligates the licensor to meet known licensee needs if the circumstances indicate that the licensee is relying on the provider’s expertise. There are many development contract and other settings where no reliance exists, including where the
                        licensee provides contract performance standards, rather than relying on the licensor or where both are knowledgeable. The express terms of the agreement may then require that the product meet the specifications, but no reliance
                        exists on whether meeting the specifications meets the licensee’s purposes.

                            General Structure and Policy. This section deals with disclaimer or limitation of warranties, except Section 401 [§ 59.1-504.1] statutory warranties that may only be disclaimed under Section 401 [§ 59.1-504.1].  This section generally corresponds to Article
                            2 and Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text).  Those statutes refer to “negating” or “limiting” warranties. This Act reflects modern terminology, referring to “disclaiming” or “modifying” warranties.
                            No substantive change is intended. This Act does not alter consumer protection statutes that may preclude disclaimer of implied warranties in consumer cases, or federal law that may in some cases prevent disclaimer of implied
                            warranties for consumer products.  The section follows  the Uniform Commercial Code and common law holding that implied warranties are default rules that parties may disclaim or limit by agreement.

                            Express Warranties. General language of disclaimer cannot exclude express warranties.  While courts should construe contract terms of disclaimer and language of express warranty as consistent whenever reasonable, in cases of inconsistency, express warranty
                            language controls.  An express warranty cannot be disclaimed, but a representation that might otherwise be an express warranty can be excluded from the bargain by the agreement. Language of the agreement, including a disclaimer,
                            may indicate that a purported warranty did not in fact become part of the bargain and is not, therefore, an express warranty.  This may occur when the language of the agreement contradicts the alleged express warranty or where
                            the agreement expressly precludes reliance on representations outside the authenticated record.

                            Disclaimers and Fraud. This Act does not alter the law of fraud. If the licensor makes an intentional misrepresentation of an existing material fact on which the licensee reasonably relied, it may be liable for fraud even if a disclaimer eliminates contractual
                            liability.  A failure to disclose known material problems in a product may constitute fraud if the elements of fraud are met and an obligation to disclose exists under law.  See e.g., Strand v. Librascope, Inc., 197 F. Supp.
                            743 (E.D. Mich. 1961). While general language of disclaimer does not generally foreclose liability for intentional fraud in most states, disclaimers specific to particular facts or categories of risk or other risk-shifting
                            language may foreclose a fraud claim by eliminating reasonable reliance on a misrepresentation.

                            Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. Subsection (b) states rules for disclaimer of implied warranties. These are subject to subsections (c), (d) and (e).  The purpose of disclaimer rules is to provide a means by which the parties can clearly achieve their
                            intended result in either disclaiming or retaining a warranty, and yet a procedure to assure that the party against which the disclaimer operates has fair notice of its terms.

                                    When a Record is Required. This Act follows Uniform Commercial Code § 2-316 (1998 Official Text). Disclaimer of implied warranties of merchantability (Section 403 [§ 59.1-504.3]) or by analogy accuracy (Section 404 [§ 59.1-504.4]) need not be in a record.
                                    Disclaimer of the “fitness” warranty must be in a record.

                                    Merchantability and Accuracy. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), under subsection (b)(1), to disclaim the warranty of merchantability or accuracy, a disclaimer is sufficient if it mentions “merchantability”, “accuracy”, or uses words
                                    of similar import and, if a record is used for disclaimer, the language is conspicuous.  These rules follow Uniform Commercial Code § 2-316 (1998 Official Text). Alternative words must reasonably achieve the purpose
                                    of clearly indicating that the warranty is not given. The rules here are subject to the general disclaimer language in subsection (b)(3) and to the other rules of subsection (c), (d) and (e).

                                    must be in a record and conspicuous.  This applies the rule in Article 2 for the “fitness” warranty to both this Act’s “fitness” warranty and the new systems integration warranty.

                                    Disclaimer of All Warranties. In some cases all implied warranties are disclaimed.  Subsection (b)(3) sets out language that is sufficient for this purpose. This general disclaimer language must be in a record and be conspicuous so as to assure fair notice
                                    of its terms.

                                    created under this Act.  The purpose is to avoid a trap for the unwary when, in common understanding, the parties have reason to know that all implied warranties were disclaimed.

                            apply to implied warranties and do not exclude express warranties.

                                    “As is” Disclaimers. Terms such as “as is” and “with all faults” in ordinary commercial usage are understood to mean that the transferee takes the entire risk as to the quality of the information involved. Typically, such expressions are not accompanied
                                    by extensive express warranties.  As in Uniform Commercial Code Article 2, recognition of the effectiveness of these terms here is a specific application of rule in subsection (e) which provides for exclusion or modification
                                    of implied warranties by usage of trade. The terms also accommodate electronic commerce that may require summary terms because of limited space in records or displays. The language need not be in a record.

                                    Inspection. Subsection (d) follows Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 (1998 Official Text). Implied warranties may be excluded or modified where the licensee examines the information or a sample or model of it before entering into the contract. The examination
                                    or opportunity to do so must occur before the contract is made. “Examination” is not synonymous with inspection before acceptance of information tendered pursuant to a contract.  It goes to the nature of the responsibility
                                    assumed by the licensor in the contract.  If the buyer discovers a defect and goes ahead to make the contract, or if it unreasonably fails to examine the information before making the contract, there is no basis to
                                    imply a warranty on a subject which examination did reveal or should have revealed.

                                    Detailed Specifications. As in Article 2, if a licensee gives detailed specifications for computer information, implied warranties may be excluded.  The warranty of fitness will not normally apply because there is no reliance on the licensor.  The warranty
                                    of merchantability must be considered in connection with Section 408 [§ 59.1-504.8] which, as in Article 2, provides that express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties. If the licensee gives detailed specification,
                                    neither the implied warranty of fitness nor the implied warranty of merchantability normally will apply.

                    <p>
                        While express warranties may survive general disclaimers, as in Article 2, the licensor is protected against unfounded claims of oral express warranties by the provisions of this Act on parol or extrinsic evidence and by the other terms of its contract.
                        It is protected against unauthorized representations by agency law. Remedies for breach of warranty are dealt with in other sections of this Act and may be modified in accordance with this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a transaction to be within subsection (d), it is not sufficient that the information merely be available for inspection. There must be a demand or offer by the licensor that the licensee examine it. This puts the licensee on notice that it is assuming
                        the risk of defects examination ought to reveal. On the other hand, if the offer of examination is accompanied by words giving assurance about their merchantability or about specific attributes and the licensee indicates clearly
                        that it is relying on those words rather than on an examination, the words may create an express warranty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The licensee’s skill and the normal method of examining information in the circumstances determine what defects are excluded. A failure to notice obvious defects cannot excuse the licensee. However, an examination made in circumstances which do not permit
                        extensive testing would not exclude defects that could be ascertained only by extensive testing. Nor are latent defects excluded by a simple examination. A merchant licensee examining a product in its own field assumes the risk
                        for all defects which a merchant in that field ought to observe, while a non-merchant licensee assumes the risk only for such defects as an ordinary person might be expected to observe.

                            Scope and policy of Section. This section deals with the effect of modifications by the licensee to computer programs if the modifications are not made using an aspect of the program intended for that purpose. The section provides that such modifications
                            eliminate performance warranties with respect to the modified copy. This rule applies only to a modified copy. Responsibility for defects in an unmodified copy is not altered. The warranties affected by a modification do not
                            include title and non-infringement warranties. The policy flows from the complexity of computer programs; even small changes may cause unanticipated and uncertain results. It often is not possible to prove to what extent a
                            change in one aspect of a program altered its performance as to other aspects.

                            Application. The section covers cases where the licensee makes changes that are not in the program options. If a user employs a menu of options to tailor a computer program, this section does not apply. However, if the user modifies code in a way not
                            intended by program options, modification eliminates performance warranties as to the altered copy. This section does not apply to modifications that occur where the parties jointly develop a program, with each authorized to
                            change code created by the other.

                            Cumulative Warranties. No warranty is created except by some conduct by the licensor. Therefore, the presumption is that all warranties are cumulative unless this construction is impossible or unreasonable, or the terms of the agreement otherwise indicate.

                            Inconsistent Warranties. Paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) give interpretive rules for determining the intent of the parties as to which of several inconsistent potential warranties prevail. These rules do not displace concepts of estoppel, but apply where
                            the licensor in good faith engaged in conduct or made representations that might establish warranties which are inconsistent. If the licensor led the licensee to believe that all the inconsistent warranties can be performed,
                            the licensor may be estopped from setting up any inconsistency as a defense.

                    <p>
                        The rules in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) ascertain the intent of the parties by reference to what probably claimed their attention in the first instance. Thus, express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties and exact or technical specifications
                        displace any inconsistent sample. In both cases, the more specific or explicit terms define the agreement. This rule may be changed by evidence showing that conditions at the time of contracting make that construction inconsistent
                        with the agreement or unreasonable in light of it.

                            11 Cal. Rptr. 2d 51, 834 P2d 745 (1992) and A.T. Kearney v. IBM, 73 F.3d 238 (9th Cir. 1997). It expands both as to the licensee’s household.  The section does not create a warranty, but deals with the question of, given a
                            contractual obligation to one party, when does that obligation extend to others.

                            Liability to Third Parties. Liability is restricted to intended third parties and those in a special relationship with the information provider. Intent requires more than that the person be within a general category of those who may use the information

                            The Restatement (Third) on Products Liability notes that informational content is not a product for that law. The only reported cases that impose product liability on information involve air flight charts. Most courts specifically
                            decline to treat informational content as a product, including the Ninth Circuit, which decided two of the air flight chart cases, but later commented that public policy accepts the idea that information once placed in public
                            moves freely and that the originator does not owe obligations to remote parties who obtain it. Winter v. G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 938 F.2d 1033 (9th Cir. 1991); Berkert v. Petrol Plus of Naugatuck, 216 Conn. 65, 579 A.2d 26 (Conn.

                            Household and Family Use. Subsection (b) expands the intended beneficiary concept to include individuals in the family of a consumer licensee. This covers both personal injury and economic losses and applies to consumer use by the indicated persons. The
                            use by the family member must be authorized under the license and the licensee must be an individual (a human being), not a corporation. The section assumes that the licensor had some reason to anticipate that the information
                            would be used in the licensee’s household. If a household member uses a commercial system licensed to a professional, this section does not extend warranties to that household member because the predicate transaction was not
                            a warranty to a consumer. On the other hand, a licensor of mass-market word processing software might reasonably expect acquisition of it by a consumer for use at home.

                            Limitation by Contract. The rules in this section establish beneficiary status, not product liability. Under subsections (c) and (d), a disclaimer or a statement excluding intent to affect third parties excludes liability under this section. This follows
                            current law. See Rosenstein v. Standard and Poor’s Corp., 636 N.E.2d 665 (Ill. App. 1993). Restrictions on the ability to limit damages for personal injury is treated in Section 803 [§ 59.1-508.3].

                        To impose liability under contract law, the information provider must have known of and clearly intended to have an effect on the third party. This requires a conscious assumption of risk or responsibility for particular third parties. Even then, courts
                        should not aggressively find the requisite intent. Information has a unique role in our culture. It is also uniquely difficult to show or disprove a causal connection between a release of informational content and harmful effects
                        to third parties. This section reflects that placing excessive liability exposure on information providers without their express undertaking may chill the dissemination of information.

                        As in transactions in goods, there may be a tension between the idea of merchantability in this Act and its role in product liability law. The primary source of tension arises from disagreement about whether the concept of defect in tort and the concept
                        of merchantability in contract are coextensive where personal injuries are involved (i.e. if a product is merchantable under warranty law can it still be defective under tort law, and if a product is not defective under tort law
                        can it be unmerchantable under warranty law?). The answer to both questions should be no. Any tension between merchantability in warranty and defect in tort when personal injuries are involved should be resolved as follows: (1)
                        when recovery is sought for injury to person or property, whether goods are merchantable is determined by applicable state products liability law; and (2) when a claim for injury to person or property is based on an implied warranty
                        of fitness or an express warranty, this Act determines whether an implied warranty of fitness or an express warranty was made and breached, as well as what damages are recoverable.

                            Scope and Effect of Section. This section provides that there are no implied warranties of non-infringement or of merchantability in transactions where a licensor does not intend to profit from the distribution of the copy or engage generally in seeking
                            commercial gain by controlling the reproduction, use, modification or redistribution of copies. The effect of coming within this section is that no disclaimer or limitation is needed for those warranties because they will not
                            be implied by this Act in such transactions.

                            Non-commercial Transactions. Under this section, transactions in computer programs do not give rise to implied warranties if they are non-commercial in nature. Thus, transactions among “shareware” providers and users, or among contributors to the development
                            of so-called ‘open source‘ software do not involve the implied warranties when the transactions are not for commercial gain. Many such transactions may not involve a contractual relationship and would, on that basis, fall outside
                            of the scope of this Act. See Section 105(d) [§ 59.1- 501.5]. Some involve licensors who do not meet the requirements necessary for certain of the implied warranties, such as warranties only provided by licensors who merchants
                            or merchants who deal in information.

                            Commercial Context as Disclaimer. Even if a transaction does not come within this section, implied warranties may be excluded by course of dealing, trade use, or the like. Section 406(e) [§ 59.1-504.6]. For example, a conveyance of program code between
                            academic entities as a voluntary part of the development of free software may occur in a setting where none of the parties anticipate implied warranties and, as a result of a trade use to that effect, may have no such warranties
                            regardless of whether this section applied or whether an effective disclaimer was made.

                            Mixed Objectives. The touchstone lies in whether the transferor intends to profit from distribution of the copy (e.g., obtain a price for the transfer that exceeds the cost of the copy), or to obtain commercial advantages from controlling use, reproduction,
                            modification or redistribution. In many cases, the circumstances are clear; a pure, voluntary, noncommercial transfer entails no implied warranties under this section. Other cases may be less clear. The issue does not depend
                            on labels used in the transaction. Thus, a transfer of a copy of a program as part of a computer system is not within this section simply because the price paid by the end user does not include a fee designated for the copy.
                            The restrictions on use of the copy and the general commercial nature of the transaction in such case means that this section does not apply. Similarly, a charge of $200 for a transaction involving a copy of a program does
                            not come within this section simply because the licensor designated the charge as being for support, rather than for delivery of the copy. On the other hand, if a provider of software makes the program freely available with
                            no restrictions or cost from a website, but also offers support and other services that the licensee may obtain or refuse, and the licensee obtains the software from that website without being required to purchase a tangible
                            copy or a computer into which the online version can be loaded, this section would exclude implied warranties for the program. However, if the economic reality of the transaction is that the program is distributed for commercial
                            gain because it has no real viability absent procurement of the service contract, then this section would not apply.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This section excludes implied warranties in cases where they would not otherwise be excluded on the foregoing bases. The exclusion depends upon the absence of intent for commercial gain from transfer or the copy or from controlling its use. In such transactions,
                        the expectations of the parties do not parallel that of commercial transactions. The imposition of an implied warranty would put an undue burden on such transactions and the methods of software development and distribution they
                        involve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exclusion covers a wide range of transactions as long as they occur without commercial profit objectives associated with distribution of the copy or controlling its use. Truly free software distribution involves no implied warranty, whether or not
                        source code is made available. For example, the section excludes implied warranties for a computer program posted on the Internet to be freely downloaded with no restrictions on use, reproduction, or distribution of additional
                        copies. On the other hand, a program provided free for a limited period of time with no right to make or distribute copies is not within the exclusion of this section if, after the limited period, the licensor expects to obtain
                        a paid license from the licensee to enable its further use of the program.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with contractual transfers of ownership of intellectual property rights. It is subject to federal law, such as the requirement of a written conveyance under copyright law. Section 105 [§ 59.1-501.5]. If copyright
                            law on work for hire applies, it controls to the extent of any inconsistency.

                            Copy vs. Rights Ownership. Ownership (title) to a copy is distinguished from ownership of intellectual property rights. This distinction is fundamental in intellectual property law and made explicit in the Copyright Act and other law. It is acknowledged
                            in subsection (b). While obtaining ownership of a copy may give the copy owner some rights with respect to that copy, it does not convey ownership of the underlying intellectual property rights in a work of authorship, a patented
                            invention or other intellectual property. The copy is merely a conduit for use, but not ownership, of rights.

                            Rights Ownership. Subsection (a) deals with when ownership of informational rights transfers as a matter of state law. The section is confined to cases where there is an intent to transfer ownership of informational rights as compared to a license to
                            use such rights or an intent to merely transfer title to a copy.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        The agreement controls. The terms of agreement may be found in express terms or usage of trade, course of dealing, or the circumstances of the particular transaction. In the absence of agreed terms, transfer of ownership of informational rights does not
                        hinge on delivery of a copy. It occurs when the information and the rights come into existence and are identified to the contract. The subsection thus reverses In re Amica, 135 Bankr. 534 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992) to the extent that
                        case suggests that ownership cannot pass until delivery of the completed work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Identification to the contract requires both completion to a sufficient level to separate the information from other information of the transferor and an indication by the transferor that the particular information is that which will be transferred under
                        the contract. In re Bedford Computer, 62 Bankr. 555 (D.N.H. 1986) provides guidance on the relevant issues. The term “identification to the contract” is used in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and
                        should be interpreted in light of that use. Early drafts or working copies are ordinarily not “identified” to a contract that provides only for a transfer of ownership of rights in a completed program because the interim drafts
                        and working copies are not intended for the licensee in fulfillment of the contract. However, if the agreement is that the licensee will own all work in progress and working drafts, then those are the contractual subject matter.
                        They are identified to the contract when created if creating the work in progress is connected to the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In many cases, an agreement provides that ownership does not vest in the transferee until it performs all of its obligations. In such cases, a material failure to perform an obligation such as to pay or provide other consideration due, precludes transfer
                        of ownership until the obligations are met. If payment or other consideration is deferred under the agreement until after ownership clearly vests, a court may reasonably conclude that receipt of that consideration was not a condition
                        precedent to the transfer of title.

                            Ownership of a Copy. Subsection (a) applies only to licenses. The basic rule is that the agreement controls. If the agreement does not provide for a transfer title to a copy, title to the copy remains in the transferor. In this Act, however, title to
                            the copy has only limited significance. Thus, subsection (a)(2) notes that the ability of a licensee to possess or control a copy does not depend “solely” on title to it — obviously, the agreement of the parties is the most
                            relevant source.

                                    Copy Ownership. In a license, title to the copy depends on the terms of the license. As in Uniform Commercial Code Article 2A (1998 Official Text), this Act does not presume a transfer of title occurs on delivery. If the license is silent, determination
                                    of whether there was an intent to transfer title to the copy to the licensee may require consideration of the context of the transaction. In general, title does not vest in the licensee if the license imposes restrictions
                                    on use of the information on that copy that are inconsistent with ownership of the copy. DSC Communications Corp. v. Pulse Communications, Inc., 170 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999) , cert. den. 528 U.S. 923 (1999).

                                    Right to Possession. Paragraph (a)(2) clarifies that the license governs rights to possession or control of a copy and that those rights do not depend solely on who has title to the copy. This corresponds to ordinary commercial expectations.

                                    Effect of Reservation of Title. Under paragraph (a)(3), reservation of title to a copy implies a reservation of title in all copies of it made by the licensee. That rule is altered if the transaction contemplates that the licensee will make copies for
                                    sale. Thus, a license of a manuscript to a publisher contemplating production of the manuscript for sale to others, reserves title only to the delivered copy and not the digital copies produced by the publisher. This
                                    rule does not apply where the licensee will transfer copies to others subject to a license mandated by the licensor. In that case, the distribution contemplated is in the form of a license and not a sale. In any case,
                                    of course, the agreement controls; express terms displace the rule in paragraph (a)(3).

                            When Title to a Copy Passes. Subsection (b) deals only with contracts where the parties agree to transfer title to a copy. The subsection states presumptions relating to when title passes, but the general rule is that the terms of the contract control.
                            In the absence of agreed terms, this section distinguishes between physical and electronic transfers. The rule for physical transfers of a tangible copy parallels Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 (1998 Official Text). Title
                            transfers when the licensor completes its obligations regarding tender of delivery, which obligations are spelled out in Section 606 [§ 59.1-506.6]. The rule for electronic transfers is the same, but explicitly defers to federal
                            copyright law. Some argue that even if there is an intent to transfer title to a copy, an electronic transfer of a copy of a copyrighted work is not a first sale because it does not involve transfer of a copy from the licensor
                            to the licensee. Under subsection (b), state law expressly coordinates with resolution of that issue in federal law.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with transfers of contractual interests.  It concerns transferability when the agreement is silent and the effect of a term prohibiting or limiting transfer. With respect to some transfers, Article 9 of the Uniform
                            Commercial Code applies and, to the extent it contains provisions that conflict with this section, Article 9 governs.  See Section 103(c) [§ 59.1-501.3(c)].

                            Transfer of Contract. The term “transfer” when used with respect to a contractual interest refers to what in many contexts is described as an “assignment of a contract.”  Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2].  The term as used in this Act does not refer to a “transfer
                            of a copyright” or similar intellectual property interest.  A transfer of the contract differs from performing the contract through a delegate in that, when a delegate is used, there is no change to or addition of parties to
                            the contract.

                            Transferability in the Absence of Contract Restrictions. Subsection (a) adopts the principle that, in the absence of contrary contract terms, contractual interests are presumed transferable unless the transfer adversely affects the interests of the other
                            party. This parallels common law and Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text).  This promotes an optimal open market in contractual rights, enhancing their value to the contracting parties.

                                    Federal Policy and Other Law. Paragraph (1) recognizes two limitations on the rule that, when an agreement does not otherwise indicate, transfer of contractual interests may be made without consent of the other party.  The first is when other law prevents
                                    transfer.  In licensing, the other source of law may very well come from a federal intellectual property policy that precludes transfer of a non-exclusive copyright or patent license without the consent of the licensor.
                                    In re Catapult Entertainment, Inc., 165 F.3d 747 (9th Cir. 1999); Everex Systems, Inc. v. Cadtrak Corp., 89 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 1996); Harris v. Emus Records Corp., 734 F.2d 1329 (9th Cir. 1984); Unarco Indus., Inc.

                                    Act also precludes the rental of a copy of a computer program by the owner of a copy without the permission of the licensor. 17 U.S.C. § 107. See Central Point Software v. Global Software &amp; Access, 880 F. Supp.
                                    957, 965 (E.D.N.Y. 1995).

                                    Material Harm to Other Party. The second limit when the contract is silent is that the contract cannot be transferred without consent, if transfer would impair the other party’s position or its expectation of performance. In addition, in some cases, a
                                    transfer may be cause for insecurity and a demand for assurance of future performance. Section 504 [§ 59.1-505.4].

                            Contractual Restrictions. Under paragraph (2) terms prohibiting transfer of a contractual interest are enforceable. This rule follows general common law and the approach of the Restatement.  As the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 322 notes, policies
                            that disfavor restraints on the alienation of property have little significance with respect to contractual interests.   For contractual interests, the dominant policy recognized in the Restatement is the ability of the parties
                            to determine the nature and scope of their contract. When they do so expressly, that choice will be recognized.  In reference to licenses, this rule also reflects the importance of the retained interest of the licensor.  The
                            rule in paragraph (2) parallels the rule for transfers made without licensor consent in copyright and patent law. Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y. 1994);  Major League
                            Baseball Promotion v. Colour-Tex, 729 F. Supp. 1035 (D. N.J. 1990); Microsoft Corp. v. Grey Computer, 910 F. Supp. 1077 (D. Md. 1995).

                            Transfer Ineffective. A prohibited transfer is ineffective, rather than merely a breach. “Ineffective” means that the transfer creates no contractual rights or privileges in respect to the relationship of the transferee and the party to the original license
                            who did not participate in the transfer.  Between the transferor and its transferee, the transfer does create contractual rights and obligations. While an ineffective transfer creates no rights against the licensor, that does
                            not mean that the transfer automatically creates a cause of action for infringement by the licensor against the transferee. Whether an infringement action exists is determined by other law.  Copyright law might permit a claim
                            of infringement against the transferor and against the transferee if their conduct infringes exclusive rights under copyright. If information is not protected under copyright, trademark, patent  or other informational rights
                            law, the fact that the transfer is ineffective does not necessarily expose the transferee to liability under this section or otherwise. Thus, in trade secret law, a good faith transferee without notice may have a right to use
                            information it receives with respect to claims under this body of law.  That rule is not changed by the contract rule stated here.  The rule making a prohibited transfer ineffective merely indicates that the transferee does
                            not receive contractual rights against or from the party who did not participate in the transfer.

                            Payment Streams. Paragraph (2)(B) allows transfer of payment streams despite a contrary contractual provision unless the transfer of the payment stream would make a material change of the other party’s position and therefore be precluded under subsection
                            (1).  In cases where Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code applies, this Act does not affect the Article 9 rule that, in itself, a contract term or statutory rule cannot preclude such transfer of a payment stream. Uniform
                            Commercial Code § 9-406(d)(c) (1999 Official Text). Article 9 governs in the case of conflict with this Act.  Section 103(c) [§ 59.1-501.3(c)].

                            Donations and the Like. Paragraph (2)(C) creates an exception to enforceability of no-transfer clauses that does not exist in any other law. The exception enables gifts to certain non-profit entities and non-commercial transfers between consumers. Federal
                            policy precludes non-consensual transfers in many situations. The exception here pushes against that policy, but restricts the invalidation of the no transfer clause to cases that are within Section 117 of the Copyright Act,
                            a section that allows transfers of a copy by its owner under certain restrictions stated in that section.

                            Mass Market Licenses. Subsection (c) provides that a term prohibiting transfer of a mass-market license must be conspicuous. This refers to terms that prohibit transfer. It does not refer to terms that control the scope of use under the license or to
                            whom warranties or other obligations extend.

                    <p>
                        When applicable, these federal rules preempt contrary state law, including paragraph (1). The federal policy on transfers flows in part from the fact that a nonexclusive license is a personal contractual privilege that does not create a property interest.
                        It is also embedded in policies of encouraging innovation and reserving to the rights owner control over to whom and when a license is granted. See, e.g., Everex Systems, Inc. v. Cadtrak Corp., 89 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 1996). This
                        Act does not change that policy.

                        These rules correspond to Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 317. Impairment may occur if the transfer is made by a party owing executory or ongoing performance and the transfer
                        shifts that performance to a third party or otherwise undermines its occurrence. Material harm should be interpreted in light of the commercial context and the original expectations of the contracting parties. The issue is not
                        only whether there will be actual harm, but whether there is a material impairment of an expectation of return performance. A continuing sense of security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due is an important
                        feature of a bargain — parties do not bargain merely for a promise or for the right to win a lawsuit. The federal policies noted above are relevant. Also, as noted in Article 2A, “[The] lessor is entitled to protect its residual
                        interest in the goods by prohibiting anyone other that the lessee from possessing or using them.” Section 2A-303,

                        Computer information transactions involve different background policy and underlying property considerations than Article 2 contracts for sales of goods and this may lead to different decisions about whether a transfer has a material adverse effect. Many
                        non-exclusive licenses may be non-transferable without the licensor’s consent. In some commercial licenses, the subject matter includes confidential information that is protected by enforceable contractual use restrictions. In
                        such cases, the party disclosing the confidential information contracts in large part on the basis of the reliability of the particular other party. The presence of confidential information may foreclose non-consensual transfers
                        because the transfer jeopardizes the other party’s enforceable interests in confidentiality and would place the confidential material in the hands of a person to which the licensor never agreed. The fact that the interest can be
                        protected by a lawsuit for damages due to wrongful disclosure does not alter the reality that the transfer itself adversely affects the contractual interest. In some cases, a similar conclusion might be reached in the absence of
                        confidential information. For example, a licensor might agree to license one company, but refuse to license a competitor that otherwise may not have access to the information. In such cases, allowing the licensee to transfer the
                        license without consent adversely affects the licensor’s interests as expressed and protected in the original license and given the intangible nature of the property and the ease of its reproduction, in effect places a licensee
                        in direct competition with the licensor as a source of the information. Of course, in some cases, refusals to license may violate other law, but that possibility is outside the scope of this Act. Similarly, a transfer that places
                        information in the hands of a competitor or a person who will engage in greater commercial or other use may be precluded if a license for such greater use would ordinarily have required additional terms or consideration.

                        Mass market licenses may present a different context. Transfer of the license will frequently not materially increase the burden or risk imposed on the other party. Even though a mass-market licensee may or may not be an owner of a copy, a transfer complying
                        with Section 117 of the Copyright Act, which allows an owner of a copy to transfer that copy so long as it transfers or destroys all copies in its possession, will often be permissible in the absence of contractual restrictions.
                        Thus, if a consumer licensee transfers his license for word processing software to another consumer and keeps no copy, there may be no impairment under this section. In other cases, however, a transfer may impair the licensor’s
                        interests. For example, if a mass market license for income tax reporting software includes a promise by the licensor to indemnify the licensee against IRS penalties incurred because of any defects in the software calculations,
                        repeated transfers of the license multiple times during a tax preparation season may increase the licensor’s burden or risk. A transfer of a license along with a single copy by a licensee that retains other copies subject to the
                        same license may also have an adverse impact (in addition to being a copyright infringement).

                        As between the transferee and the party that did not participate in the transfer, if the rule were otherwise (e.g., the prohibited transfer is effective, but a breach of contract), there would be a potentially significant period of time in which the transferee
                        might be protected by the license before the license could be canceled in litigation. During that time, there could be serious adverse impact on the non-transferring party, despite its contractual effort to limit transferability
                        of the license.

        Illustration.
       </b> Assume a license for $5,000 that allows Small Licensee (SL) (a five employee company) to make “as many copies as needed for use in licensee’s business”; the license is expressly not transferable. SL transfers the license
                        to AT&amp;T, a company with 300,000 employees. If the transfer is merely a breach, AT&amp;T may be permitted to make as many copies as it needs for 300,000 employees until licensor learns of the breach and cancels the license against
                        SL. The rule making the transfer ineffective preserves the original bargain. As between SL and AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T would be entitled to refund of the consideration paid for the transfer.

                            Scope of Section. This section follows Articles 2 and 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text). It describes the effect of a transfer of contract rights. It is not a comprehensive statement of the law on assignment and delegation. Issues
                            not addressed here are left to other law.

                            Subject to Contract Terms. An effective transfer of a contract constitutes a transfer of contract rights and, unless the agreement or the circumstances otherwise indicate, a delegation of contractual duties. The transferee, by accepting the transfer,
                            promises to perform the contract. It is bound by the terms of the original contract, including contractual use terms. The transferee’s obligation can be enforced by the other party to the original contract. In effect, as between
                            the transferee and the other party to the original contract, the transfer places the transferee into the position held by its transferor.

                            Transfers in General and for Security. Subsection (b)(2) recognizes a general rule of construction distinguishing between a commercial assignment of a contract, which puts the transferee into the position of the transferor as to rights and duties, and
                            other transfers that might be for a different purpose such as a transfer to create a security interest under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. When the latter occurs, the transfer constitutes neither an outright transfer
                            of rights of the transferor nor a delegation of the transferor’s duties to the secured party.

                            Assurances. Subsection (c) recognizes that the non-transferring party has a stake in the reliability, identity or other aspects of the person to whom the contract is transferred. In part, that stake is protected under Section 503 [§ 59.1-505.3]. Subsection
                            (c) also gives the non-transferring party a right to demand adequate assurances of future performance and to proceed under Section 708 [§ 59.1-507.8] to protect its interest in performance of the contract. See Comments to Section
                            503 [§ 59.1-505.3].

                        However, as between the transferor and the other party to the original contract, paragraph (b)(4) follows current law, providing that the transfer does not alter the transferor’s obligations to the original contracting party in the absence of an express
                        consent by that party to a novation. Mere transfer does not create a novation or eliminate the otherwise enforceable contractual rights created between the original parties.

                            Performance Through a Delegate. Performance through a delegate or subcontracting of performance occurs when a party to the original contract uses a third party to make an affirmative performance under a contract. While the performance may be by the delegate,

                            Effect of Contract. The ability to delegate is subject to terms of the agreement to the contrary. Those terms may be direct or indirect. For example, a contract might expressly preclude delegation or it might restrict use of licensed information to a
                            named person or entity and thus indirectly preclude delegation of the rights or duties to any other person. A contract whose terms are confidential might have the same effect because to disclose contract terms to the delegate
                            (in order to ensure appropriate performance of the contract) might breach the duty of confidentiality.

                            Delegation in the Absence of a Contract Restriction. In the absence of a contractual limitation, delegation can occur unless the other party has a substantial interest in having the original party perform or control the performance. Obviously, a party
                            has a substantial interest in having the original party perform if the delegation triggers the restrictions in 503, but it may also have such an interest in other cases. Thus, for example, a contract for software to be developed
                            by an internationally known individual software developer might ordinarily not permit that individual to delegate the development entirely to a third party of lesser stature.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with the effect of a transfer of a licensee’s contractual interest. If there is a conflict between this section and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Article 9 governs. See Section 103(c) [§ 59.1-501.3(c)].

                            Transferee Interests. Subsection (a) provides that a transferee of the licensee acquires only the rights that the license and this Act allow. This rule applies to purchasers of contractual interests, including persons who acquire an interest for the purposes
                            of financing, and to transferees that acquire the transfer by involuntary means, such as enforcement of a judgment. This rule reflects the simple fact that what is transferred is the contract and that the transfer cannot change
                            that contract. This principle holds true even if the transfer includes physical manifestations of the computer information that is subject to the license. The recipient of an effective transfer takes subject to the terms of
                            the license.

                            Transfers and Underlying Property Rights. Subsection (b) provides that as a general rule, a licensee’s transferee acquires only those contractual or other rights that the licensee was authorized to transfer. There is no principle of bona fide purchaser
                            of a mere contract right.

                        Similarly, neither copyright nor patent recognize concepts of protecting a buyer in the ordinary course (or other good faith purchaser) by giving that person greater rights than were authorized to be transferred even if the transfer includes delivery
                        of a copy associated with the contract. Transfers that exceed or are otherwise unlicensed by a patent or copyright owner create no rights of use in the transferee. Indeed, such transfers may in themselves be an infringing act.
                        A transferee that takes outside the chain of authorized distribution does not benefit from ideas of good faith purchase and its use is likely to constitute infringement. See Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics,

                        Subsection (b) recognizes the major exception to this principle, which allows a bona fide purchaser in reference to trade secret claims to the extent that body of law confers such rights. Trade secret law enforces confidentiality. If a party takes without
                        notice of such confidentiality restrictions, it may not be bound by them; it is in effect a good faith purchaser, free of any obligations under that law. This section does not define when or to what extent this is true, but defers
                        to applicable rules under that body of law.

                            Scope of the Section. This Act recognizes two different positions in which a financier may become involved in financing related to a license. The first involves a financing relationship where the financier does not become party to the license. The second
                            is where the financier does become a party to the license and transfers the contractual rights to the party ultimately intended to use the computer information. This latter arrangement resembles a “finance lease” as dealt with
                            in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, but concerns licensed computer information, rather than leased goods. This section deals with circumstances in which a financier in a transaction with a licensee does not become
                            a licensee of the license as part of the transaction.

                            Financier. A “financier” is a person who makes a financial accommodation to a licensee under a financial accommodation contract. Because a contract that creates or provides for a security interest governed by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code cannot
                            be a financial accommodation contract under the definition of that term, a financier does not include a secured party under Article 9. Nor does the term include a licensor. A secured party’s position is governed by Article
                            9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.

                            Rights of Financier. If the financier does not become a party to the license, it obtains neither the benefits nor the burdens of the license. Under paragraph (2)(c), the financial accommodation contract between the financier and the licensee may add additional
                            conditions to the licensee’s right to use the licensed information or rights, but these terms are solely between the licensee and the financier. This enables this form of financing by enforcing conditions to support it. In
                            effect, to the extent conditions are established in the financial accommodation contract, the licensee contracts away its own contractual right to act under the license, but does not alter or convey any part of, or interest
                            in, the license itself.

                            Relationship to Licensor. Paragraph (2) makes clear that, notwithstanding any private arrangement between the licensee and a financier, the contractual and other rights of the licensor are dominant with respect to the licensed information. Thus, the financier’s
                            contract cannot expand any of the licensee’s rights under the license. The financier’s contract cannot alter any of the rights of the licensor.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with “finance licenses.” A “finance license” is analogous to the finance lease in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, but involves different subject matter and different practical expectations. The transaction
                            involves a license to the financier and an immediate transfer to the financially accommodated licensee. Subsection (a) describes when the retransfer of the license is effective. Subsection (b) deals with some of the resulting
                            substantive conditions among the parties.
                        </li>

                            Transfer for Financial Purposes. The basic transaction occurs when a license is made to a financier who then transfers the license to the accommodated licensee. Paragraph (a)(1) sets out two sets of conditions for when this transfer is effective. The
                            first is when a transfer of contractual interests is allowed by Section 503. This occurs when there is no impairment of the licensor’s interests and the license does not preclude transfer. The second, provided for in paragraph
                            (a)(1)(B) creates a new method of transfer limited to this context and providing for enhanced opportunities to engage in license-based financing. This paragraph establishes a notification procedure requiring clear notice to
                            the licensor, but otherwise enabling an efficient system of allowing the financier’s transfer to its client. The notice must be in a record and received by the licensor before the information is delivered or the license granted.
                            It must clearly indicate the intended purpose and name the eventual licensee. Under these conditions, if the accommodated licensee adopts the terms of the license, the transfer or sublicense to it is effective even if there
                            is no formal consent by the licensor.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a05s59.1-505.8-officialcomment.1ol13">
                            Licensee’s Rights. Given an effective transfer, paragraph (b)(1) makes clear that the licensee’s position with respect to the licensed information is governed primarily by the terms of the license and is subject to the licensor’s informational rights.
                            The license is the dominant contractual relationship. The financier and the licensee, however, may agree on additional conditions between themselves. These are enforceable against the licensee even though the primary rights
                            and limitations regarding the information will come from the license and will be the licensor’s rights.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a05s59.1-505.8-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Warranties. Under paragraph (b)(2), as in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, a financier does not make implied warranties to the accommodated licensee, except for the warranty of non-interference. As to substantive performance issues pertaining
                            to the licensed information, the financier is outside the structure pertinent to the polices that support merchantability and other warranties.

                    <p>
                        Under paragraph (a)(2), the de facto consent created through this notification procedure covers only the single, designated transfer of contractual rights in the license. Of course, if the contract between the financier and its licensee creates a right
                        to payment to the financier under the license, the financial accommodation contract, or otherwise, a transfer of that payment right is not affected by this rule. In many cases, the transfer of the payment right will be governed
                        by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The focus is on transfers by the financier of other rights under the license, such as the right to use or disclose the licensed information.

                            Scope of the Section. This section applies irrespective of whether the financier becomes a licensee. It adopts a principle recognized in common law and in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code that allows the creation by contract of irrevocable rights
                            that are independent of otherwise available defenses. As in Article 2A, this principle does not extend to consumer contracts, leaving the issue in such cases to other law.

                            Hell or High Water. This section extends the benefits of the classic “hell or high water” clause to a finance license that is not a consumer license. However, the “hell or high water right” must be a term of the contract. This section makes promises in
                            a financial accommodation contract irrevocable and independent due to the function of the financier in a three party relationship: the licensee is looking to the licensor to perform essential covenants and warranties. On the
                            licensee’s acceptance of the license, the licensee’s promises to the financier under the financial accommodation contract become irrevocable and independent. While the accommodated licensee must perform with respect to the
                            financier even if the licensor’s performance is not in accordance with the license. The licensee may have and pursue a cause of action against the licensor.

                            Scope of the Section. The primary relationship between the financier and the licensee is based on their financial accommodation contract. This contact may grant enforcement rights to the financier on breach of that contract. Subsection (a) sets out aspects
                            of the financier’s rights on breach. A premise of this section is that, notwithstanding the rights created under the financial accommodation contract, exercise of those rights is subject to the predominant rights of the licensor
                            under the license.
                        </li>

                            Rights in the Event of Breach. Subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) recognize the enforceability of the financial accommodation contract. Those rights may be subject to the overriding rights of the original licensor, however, as indicated in paragraphs (a)(3)
                            and (a)(4). Under subsection (a)(4), the remedies in the financial accommodation contract are the only remedies that a financier may exercise if the financier did not become a licensee. This includes the right to enforce contractual
                            rights preventing further use of the information. However, such a right does not give this type of financier a right to possession, control or use of the information itself. That right remains controlled by the license and
                            the licensor.

                            Finance Licenses (subsection (a)(3)). Where the transaction involves a finance license in which the financier acquires a license for purposes of transferring it to the licensee, on breach of the financial accommodation contract the financier has the remedies
                            under this Act, subject to restrictions of this Act. These remedies are the remedies provided by this Act for breach, not remedies that may be in the license. The financier may also exercise remedies in the financial accommodation
                            contract or allowed by other law as applicable.
                        </li>

                            Other Financiers (subsection (a)(4)). Subsection (a)(4) deals with cases where the financier did not become a licensee. It recognizes that, as between the financier and licensee, on breach of the financial accommodation contract the financier has a right
                            to enforce a term in that contract preventing further use of the information. However, that does not give this type of financier a right to possess, control, or use the information, or to transfer the license. Transfer is not
                            appropriate because the financier did not become a licensee and thus has nothing to transfer. However, a provision of the financial accommodation contract allowing the financier to take possession of or to use information may
                            or may not be a transfer of a contractual right that would invoke Section 503 [§ 59.1-505.3]. Subsection (a)(4) requires compliance with both Section 503 [§ 59.1-505.3] and subsection (b).

                            Relationship of License and Accommodation Contract. Subsection (b) sets out additional restrictions on the subsection (a) remedies. The protections are like those in Section 503 but do not necessarily involve, as does Section 503, a transfer of contractual
                            rights. The basic premise is that actions of the financier and the licensee should not impair the rights of the licensor without appropriate consent. Thus, notwithstanding any contrary rights under the financial accommodation
                            contract, the financier cannot take possession of or use the information if doing so would adversely affect the licensor. Similarly, except as expressed in paragraph (b)(2), the financier cannot transfer the license or the
                            information. In cases where the license is royalty-bearing, the principle that the licensor’s expectation and return performance cannot be seriously impaired by exercise of remedies under the financial contract may preclude
                            any remedy by the financier preventing use by the licensee without the licensor’s consent to that step.

                            Effect on Licensor. While this Act expands the ability of parties to establish financier interests related to a license, subsection (a) makes clear that creating a financier’s interest places no obligations on the licensor, nor does it alter the licensor’s
                            rights. For example, the licensor can, despite the existence of the financier’s relationship with the licensee, exercise rights to cancel or otherwise enforce the license. The licensor’s position is not affected by the financier’s
                            involvement unless the licensor has otherwise expressly agreed to alter it. A financier’s relationship to a licensee, as is true with a secured creditor’s relationship, is dependent and conditional on the terms of the license.
                            A decision by a licensor to cancel the license can be exercised entirely with reference to the financier’s contractual position. Once the license is canceled, of course, it no longer provides a basis for the financier’s recovery
                            of its loans, but that is inherent in the nature of the relationship itself.

                            effect in a record. Such consent may be in a license or in another record.

                            Scope of the Section. This section brings together general principles of contract performance. Where performance involves a tender of a copy, under subsection (d), this section is supplanted by specific sections on tender, acceptance, and refusal of copies.
                            This section and Parts 6 and 7 generally, use the term “refusal” in circumstances where Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code would use the term “rejection.” The concepts are similar, although the differences between information
                            and goods precludes rote application of Article 2 rules.

                            Duty to Conform. A party must conform to its contract. A failure to conform gives the aggrieved party a right to a remedy, subject to concepts of waiver. Under this Act, what remedies are available depends on the agreement and, in absence of agreement,
                            on whether the breach was material. Under the Restatement view, and as adopted here, a party’s duty to perform is contingent on the absence of an uncured prior material breach by the other party. Restatement (Second) of Contracts
                            § 237. This contingent relationship described in subsection (b) does not refer to restrictions in contractual use terms. A breach by one party does not allow the other to ignore those restrictions even if the aggrieved party
                            has a duty to mitigate loss. A breach by the licensor, for example, does not give the licensee rights to act in derogation of use restrictions or to ignore the intellectual property rights that may buttress them.

                            Material Breach. Subsection (b) follows the Restatement (Second) of Contracts and common law. It adopts the standard of material breach for determining the nature of the remedies available for breach by the other party. The concept of material breach
                            is applied throughout contract law and has been relied on by courts for generations. It holds that a minor defect in performance does not warrant rejection or cancellation of a contract: the remedy lies in recovery of damages.
                            The policy is to avoid forfeiture for small errors. Often, truly perfect performance cannot even be expected. If the parties desire to create a more stringent standard, they must do so in their agreement. The material breach
                            standard applies to performances of both the licensor and licensee. A licensor that receives imperfect performance cannot cancel the contract for a minor problem, nor can the licensee.

                            Conforming Tender: Mass Market. Under subsection (b)(1), the material breach standard does not apply to delivery of a copy in a mass-market transaction. See Section 704(b) [§ 59.1-507.4(b)]. Instead, this Act adopts the rule in Article 2 and Article 2A
                            of the Uniform Commercial Code, which allow rejection of a copy that does not conform to the contract in one situation: a delivery not part of an installment contract. This “conforming tender” rule (sometimes described as the
                            “perfect tender” rule) for cases involving delivery of a copy in mass-market transactions As in Article 2, what is a conforming tender is restricted by considerations regarding merchantability, a right to cure, and usage of
                            trade and course of dealing. It is further limited by principles of waiver. As one leading treatise comments: “[we have found no case that] actually grants rejection on what could fairly be called an insubstantial non-conformity

                            Duty to Accept and Tender. Subsection (c) brings together general rules from the Restatement and Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 (1998 Official Text) regarding the sequence of performance where mutual performances are to be exchanged. The primary principle
                            is that tender of performance entitles the tendering party to acceptance of that performance. If the tendered performance is a material breach, the party receiving it is not required to perform. As subsection (d) indicates,
                            where the performance is delivery of a copy, these general rules are subject to the more specific rules on tender and acceptance of copies in sections 606 through 610 [§§ 59.1-506.6 through 59.1-506.10], and 704 through 707
                            [§§ 59.1-507.4 through 59.1-507.7].

                            Refusing a Performance and Cancellation. An important distinction exists between the right to refuse a particular performance and the right to cancel the entire contract. A party may refuse a performance if it is a material breach as to that performance.
                            Whether that breach also allows the party to cancel the entire contract depends on whether the breach is material to the entire contractual relationship. In contracts where the entire performance is delivery of a single copy,
                            a right to refuse the copy corresponds to the right to cancel the contract. In more complex situations, a single breach may not be material to the whole agreement.

                        The reference to contractual use terms is a reference to the restrictions in such terms. If a licensor breaches, the licensee is the aggrieved party and need not perform, e.g., the licensee need not make a payment. However, if the contractual use terms
                        include a restrictions such as “business use only,” that restriction continues to apply because breach does not change the nature of the contract. If a licensee breaches, the licensor is the aggrieved party and need not perform,
                        e.g., the licensor need not provide access to a licensee under an access contract. However, if the access was to data of the licensee that the licensor agreed to hold in confidence, the licensor remains bound by that contractual
                        use term restriction. Again, breach does not change the nature of the contract.

                            Scope of the Section. This section states and defines the licensor’s general obligation to enable use of the information or access that it provides to the licensee. The licensor’s obligation in most cases consists of two elements: making the information
                            available (if necessary) and giving authority or permission to use the information. Of course, this is subject to contrary agreement.

                            No Acts Required. A licensor may or may not be required to deliver anything. In many cases, it suffices to authorize use of information that the licensee obtained from other sources or to authorize access to information. Paragraph (b)(1) recognizes that
                            fact and the role of mere authorization of use or access in such cases (e.g., when a party is already in possession of a photograph that it desires to use in a digital multi-media work, but must obtain permission to do so from
                            the photographer holding the copyright).

                            Tender of Copy. Paragraph (b)(2) deals with cases where enabling use requires providing a copy of the information. The rule it states parallels existing law concerning goods. The obligation is to tender delivery of the copy to the licensee.

                            Access Material. Subsection (b)(3) requires the licensor to supply necessary authorization codes or other access materials to obtain the agreed access. It is limited to items unique to that access such as a password; the fact that access may assume use
                            of generic items such as a computer or a particular kind or version of software browser does not make those items “access materials” or require the licensor to supply them in order to enable use.

                            must cooperate in completing that recording.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with situations where rules on the sale of goods, involving tender, acceptance and rejection of the goods, are not appropriate because the agreement calls for submissions of informational content to the satisfaction
                            of the receiving party. The section deals only with contract law and does not address rights under other law or equity principles.

                            Tender-acceptance Rules Not Applicable. Under paragraph (1), rules regarding tender, acceptance and rejection of copies do not apply if the transaction involves information submitted under terms providing for approval to the satisfaction of the licensee.
                            These rules are modeled on rules for the sale of goods. There, the focus is on making immediate decisions about the particular item. In computer information transactions of the type described here, a submission triggers a process
                            that centers around the commercial expectation that the recipient has the right to reject if the submission does not satisfy its expectations, but that immediate acceptance or rejection will often not occur. A process of revision
                            and tailoring more commonly occurs. The rule here corresponds the law to ordinary commercial expectations.

                            Express Choices. Acceptance or refusal of the submission is not to be implied from delay and silence alone. Consistent with ordinary practices, paragraph (3) makes clear that only explicit refusal or acceptance suffices since the agreement is conditioned
                            on the satisfaction of the receiving party. However, until acceptance, the recipient cannot “use” the submitted information. This refers to commercial exploitation and does not prevent use for the purpose of reviewing, correcting,
                            or otherwise adjusting the information to meet the recipient’s satisfaction if permitted by the agreement.

                            commercial standards associated with the applicable context.

                            Inspection. In transactions governed by this section, merely viewing or receiving the information transfers significant value to the licensee which cannot be returned. Given that fact, subsection (3) clarifies that inspection rights are limited to media
                            and packaging. A person that joins a fee-based celebrity chat room cannot participate (e.g., receive the performance) before deciding whether to accept or not accept it. The participation itself transfers the value and that
                            value cannot be returned. A person licensing the formula for Coca Cola cannot view the information and potentially memorize the formula before being bound to the contract and its performance under the contract. Of course, in
                            these and all other cases, if the performance when received does not conform to the contract, the aggrieved party is entitled to remedies for breach.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with electronic or physical limitations on use of information that enforce contract terms by preventing breach, by preventing uses that are inconsistent with the contract, or by implementing a contracted-for termination
                            of rights to use the information. The section does not deal with devices used to enforce rights in the event of cancellation for breach or with enforcement concerning information outside the subject matter of this Act. The
                            restraints here derive from contract terms and limit use consistent with the contract.

                            Nature of a Restraint. The idea of a “restraint” is analogous to the concept in the Copyright Act of a technological measure restricting access to a copyrighted work, but is related to contract terms, rather than copyright protection. 17 U.S.C. § 1201
                            (1999). It does not refer to situations in which the formatting, language or other characteristics of the computer information itself by their nature limit how access to or use of information can occur, nor does it create an
                            affirmative obligation to prepare or transform information in a manner so that it will be accessible by other systems — incompatibilities are not a restraint as used in this section. Rather, “restraint” refers to a technological
                            or physical measure whose intended purpose is to create a limitation to conform use of the information to the contract, such as a device that restricts access at the end of the duration of a license. An analog in a physical
                            world would be the timing device that limits a laundromat dryer to 30 minutes use if only a 30 minute duration was purchased.

                            Bases for Use. The basic principle is that a contract can be enforced and that it may be appropriate to do so through automated means. Subsection (b) states alternative bases that permit use of automated restraints. The alternatives are coequal; satisfying
                            any one supports use of the restraint under this section. The list is not exclusive and does not limit federal or other law (including other contract law) allowing use of limiting devices (restraints). The enforceable terms
                            of the agreement must support the restraint. A restraint inconsistent with the contract is a breach of contract.

                                    Contract Authorization. Subsection (b)(1) applies if the agreement authorizes the party to use the restraint. The authorization must be in addition to the contract term that the restraint enforces. Thus to be within subsection (b)(1) in a contract for
                                    30 minutes of use, an agreement must also contain a term authorizing use of a restraint to enforce that limitation of duration of use.

                                    Passive Restraints That Prevent Breach. Subsection (b)(2) provides that a restraint can be used without notice or specific contract authorization if it merely prevents use inconsistent with contract terms or the intellectual property rights of the party
                                    using the restraint. All the restraint may do is prevent use; if it does more than that, it is not authorized by this subsection, but must find support in other law. For example, if a license restricts the licensee
                                    to only one back-up copy, this subsection authorizes a restraint to enforce that limitation so long as the restraint does not destroy the licensed information. However, an agreement that limits use to a particular location
                                    may allow destruction of the copy set up at an unauthorized location if the licensee still retains the copy at the appropriate location. Of course, this presumes that the agreement limits the location at which the information
                                    could be used. Determining what is the agreement depends on the relevant considerations applicable under this Act. Restraints enforce contracts, but do not impose a penalty for attempted breach. Thus, if an enforceable
                                    contract term limits use of a copy of digital information to a single concurrent user, a restraint precluding multiple concurrent users is authorized. A restraint that deletes the authorized digital copy if the licensee
                                    attempts to allow multiple concurrent users is not authorized by this subsection.
                                </li>

                                    Enforcing Informational Rights. Subsection (b)(2) also allows use of passive devices that preclude infringing informational rights. Merely preventing the infringing act does not require a contract term or notice. Thus, a contract that grants a right to
                                    make a back-up copy and to use a digital image, is silent on the right of the licensee to transmit additional copies electronically, although such may be precluded by intellectual property law absent fair use. A device
                                    that precludes communication of the file electronically, but does not alter or erase the image in the event of an attempt to do so, is authorized under (b)(2).

                                    Enforcing Termination. The restraints authorized in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) enforce termination, which ends the contract for reasons other than breach. Subsection (b)(3) allows restraints that end use upon expiration of a stated term or number of
                                    uses. At termination, the restraint may do more than merely prevent use because, at the end of the contract period, the party no longer has any rights in the information under the license. Thus, a machine allowing a
                                    single video game play can automatically discontinue use or delete the game when that game is completed. A license for a time-limited use of downloaded software fragments allows erasure of those elements when the limited
                                    time for use expires. Consistent with general contract law rules on termination, no prior notice is required for such termination. In contrast, subsection (b)(4) requires prior notice if the restraint implements termination
                                    other than on the happening of an agreed event.

                            Licensee’s Information. Under subsection (c), nothing in this section authorizes active devices that affirmatively limit the licensee’s ability to access or use its own information through its own means (means other than by continued use of the licensed
                            subject matter itself). Thus if a licensee storing data on its own Internet server contracted to use spreadsheet application X for 30 minutes with that data, a restraint in the spreadsheet may terminate its use after 30 minutes
                            but may not block access to the data. If the licensee obtains a license to use spreadsheet application Y, it may access its data with the new spreadsheet but may not continue to use spreadsheet X to do so (absent a license
                            for additional use). Use of a restraint that prevents the licensee from accessing its information through means other than the licensed subject matter is a breach of contract and may be a basis for liability under other law
                            if applicable.

                            Proper Use. Subsection (d) confirms that if use of a restraint is consistent with enforceable terms of the license and permitted under this section, there is no liability in contract from its use. If the restraint misfunctions and causes damage to, or
                            deletion of, property of the licensee that is outside this section, there may be liability for such loss in contract or under other law. This section does not alter law in such cases. Similarly, if use of the restraint violates
                            another promise, such as a warranty that no restraints were in the software, that breach of contract and any resulting damages are not affected by this subsection.

                        under this section since it depends on breach of contract. If, however, after the license reaches the end of the contracted year a restraint turns off and deletes the software, such does not depend upon breach and is valid under
                        this section.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with how tender of delivery of a copy is made. It corresponds to Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) with changes that reflect information as the subject matter. As with the other section
                            in Part 6, [§ 59.1-506.1 et seq.], Subpart B of this Act, this section deals only with delivery of a copy, not with the license to use the information. The effect of a defective tender is discussed in Part 7 [§ 59.1-507.1 et
                            seq.], Subpart B of this Act.

                            Shipment vs. Destination Contracts. Subsection (a) maintains the distinction between shipment and destination contracts as that rule exists under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and also the underlying doctrine about when
                            a contract is a shipment or a destination contract. The norm is a shipment contract; destination contracts are the exception which require an explicit agreement, such as by use of destination contract terms. For illustrative
                            cases, see California State Electronics Assoc. v. Zeos International Ltd., 49 Cal. Rptr. 2d 127 (Cal. App. 2 Dist. 1996) and Windows, Inc. v. Jordan Panel Systems Corp., 38 UCC Rep. Serv. 2d 267 (2d Cir. 1999).

                            Tender of a Copy. Subsection (b) provides default rules regarding what constitutes tender of delivery of a copy. These rules generally correspond to Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 (1998 Official Text) and to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. A
                            tender requires that the copy be put and held available at the appropriate place and that the other party be notified of the tender. A physical or electronic tender not made through a carrier must be at a place to which the
                            party receiving tender has access for purposes of obtaining the copy.
                        </li>

                            Electronic Tender. Subsection (b)(2)(B) recognizes that electronic tenders of a copy may or may not involve transmission by the tendering party itself. That party may instead contract with the equivalent of an electronic carrier who is better suited to
                            make transmissions, such as secure transmissions. In that event, putting the copy into the hands of, or otherwise making it available to, the electronic transmitter has the same effect as putting a physical copy into the hands
                            of a traditional carrier or the like.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The strong presumption is that the licensor is not required to deliver to a particular destination unless the agreement explicitly so provides. Thus, the obligation in the absence of a contrary agreement, is to make the copies available at the licensor’s
                        site (in Incoterms 2000, the Group “E” terms (EXW-Ex Works)) or, if shipment is agreed, to tender them per the licensee’s instructions for carriage or to a transmission facility making appropriate arrangements for their transport
                        or transmission, with fees payable by the licensee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Merely designating a place to which shipment will be made does not create a “destination” contract or alter the presumption that a “shipment contract” is intended. U.C.C. examples of shipment contract terms include “F.O.B. point of shipment” (U.C.C. §
                        2-504), “C.I.F.”, “C.I.F. destination” and “C.&amp;F.” (U.C.C. § 2-320). Under the international Incoterms 2000, shipment (departure) contracts include the Group “F” terms and the Group “C” terms such as “FCA” (Free Carrier), CIF
                        (Cost, Insurance and Freight), but not the Group “D” terms such as “DAF” (Delivered At Frontier). The Group “D” terms are destination contracts, also known as “arrival” contracts. Customs of ports and regions, as well as trade
                        usage, can also influence the meaning of trade terms.

                            Scope of the Section. This section brings together a variety of rules from Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and from the Restatement (Second) of Contracts as applicable. It deals only with transfers involving delivery of a
                            copy.

                            Basic Rule. The basic approach follows Article 2. A tender of delivery of a copy is a condition to the duty to accept the copy and to the obligation to pay for that copy. This is subject to contrary agreement, including the effect of applicable usage
                            of trade. In many transactions, the commercial context and the agreement alters this expectation. For example, an agreement that involves payment of royalties alters the rule — royalties cannot accrue until use of the licensed
                            information. In such contracts, payment is due as agreed.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with the right to inspect a copy and its relationship to acceptance of the copy and the duty to pay. It follows Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) with changes that reflect computer information
                            as the subject matter.

                            Relationship to Acceptance. An opportunity to inspect a copy is ordinarily a condition to acceptance of it. Acceptance in this sense refers to acceptance of the copy and not to accepting the terms of an agreement or adopting contract terms. Where payment
                            occurs before an opportunity to inspect the copy, subsection (d) makes clear that payment is not acceptance of the copy. Thus, for example, the licensee may nevertheless refuse the copy because of a defect once an opportunity
                            to inspect is had. This is the same rule as in Article 2.

                            Type of Inspection. The type of inspection permitted depends on the commercial context, including the agreement of the parties. This follows Article 2 and cases decided under Article 2 are applicable in interpreting this section. If the parties agree
                            to an extended or extensive procedure of pre-acceptance testing, that agreement supplants the general standard of this section. In the absence of agreement, the standard is that inspection must be in a reasonable time and manner.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.8-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Confidentiality Obligations. Under subsection (a)(4), if a party is under an obligation of confidentiality, its inspection of a copy is subject to that obligation. The requirement that the obligation be existing requires that it be in the contract giving
                            rise to the inspection or another agreement, including agreements formed by course of dealing, usage of trade and the like. However, the inspecting party is not required to infer or presume an obligation of confidentiality.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.8-officialcomment.1ol15">
                            Defects Not Discovered. As in Article 2, a failure to inspect or a failure to discover all defects during an inspection does not necessarily alter the party’s remedies for the undiscovered defect. If a latent defect exists which was not known to the accepting
                            party, acceptance of the copy does not alter that party’s right to a remedy for the defect when eventually discovered. Section 610 [§ 59.1-506.10]. The right to inspect should be contrasted to the rule stated in Section 402
                            which deals with the effect of an examination of the copy on the existence of an express warranty. Both rules conform to Article 2 (1998 Official Text). “Examination” as a means of establishing or precluding contract terms
                            or warranties infers a more extended opportunity to analyze the copy than does the right to inspect before acceptance of a copy under this section.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with what constitutes acceptance of a copy. The effect of acceptance of a copy is stated in Section 610 [§ 59.1-506.10]. This section derives from Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 and Article 2A (1998 Official
                            Text). It does not deal with “offer” and “acceptance” as they pertain to formation of a contract or adoption of terms.

                            Nature of Acceptance. Acceptance of a copy is the opposite of refusal of a copy. Under Section 610(a) [§ 59.1-506.10(a)], acceptance precludes refusal and, if made with knowledge of any nonconformity, may not be revoked because of it unless acceptance
                            was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance puts the burden on the party accepting the copy to prove any breach with respect to that copy. See Section 601 [§ 59.1-506.1]. However,
                            while acceptance of a copy precludes refusal of it, acceptance does not in itself impair any other remedy for nonconformity, including revocation of acceptance.

                            What Constitutes Acceptance. Subsection (a) provides guidance on what constitutes acceptance of a copy. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) conform to Uniform Commercial Code Article 2-606 and to Article 2A (1998 Official Text). Acts as well as communications
                            may signify acceptance. Similarly, a failure to reject constitutes acceptance, even if there has been no communication to that effect to the other party. These rules must be read in connection with subsection (b) which indicates
                            that the referenced acts or communications are not acceptance unless they occur after a reasonable opportunity to inspect, if it had a right to inspect the information or copy under the agreement or this Act.

                                    Commingling. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) focus on two circumstances significant in computer information that differ from cases involving goods. Paragraph (a)(3), reflects that it is inequitable or impossible to reject data or information after having
                                    commingled it. The commingling party retains its remedies for breach, but commingling renders inappropriate the remedy of refusing the copy. To refuse a copy or revoke an acceptance of it, the refusing party must return
                                    or keep it available for return to the other party: commingling precludes this. Commingling includes blending the information into a common mass in which it is indistinguishable. It also refers to software integrated
                                    into a complex system in a way that renders removal and return impossible and to information integrated into a database from which it cannot be separated.

                                    Non-returnable Benefits. Subsection (a)(4) treats as acceptance the receipt, use or exploitation of a value of the information provided by the licensor. In many instances merely being exposed to data or other material transfers significant value. See
                                    Comments to Section 604 [§ 59.1-506.4]. Often, use of the information does the same. Refusal is not a useful paradigm as a remedy. The recipient can sue for damages for breach and, depending on the nature and extent
                                    of breach, either obtain reimbursement of the price or avoid paying a price that would otherwise be due.

                                    Ownership. Paragraph (a)(5) follows the rule in Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 (1998 Official Text). In Article 2, the rule is that, even if the buyer did not explicitly accept the goods, acts inconsistent with the seller’s ownership constitute acceptance
                                    if ratified by the seller. This gives the seller an option to either treat the acts as acceptance, or as a rejection followed by acts of conversion or the like.

                            Delivery in Stages. Subsection (c) deals with an agreement in which the intended final product is delivered and accepted in segments or modules. This is not an installment contract where the modules are and will remain separate, but a delivery in stages
                            of a single information product. In such cases, acceptance of each module is a separate event, but this subsection provides that each acceptance is implicitly conditional on eventual acceptance of the whole. While this rule
                            can be varied by agreement, it represents the most likely expectation of the parties in such ongoing development contexts.

                        In information transactions, the options are less clear, since a licensee can avoid express acceptance of the information, but act in a manner that would be outside the contract terms, even had it accepted the tender. Paragraph (a)(5) gives the licensor
                        a right to elect where the inconsistent acts are within contractual use terms. It recognizes that, if the licensor decides to treat the acts as acceptance, it need not also ratify acts of a licensee that would, in any event, be
                        outside the contract terms and constitute infringement. For example, if a licensor provides a conforming copy of educational software for use in a single school district and the district, while not signifying acceptance of the
                        copy, distributes the software throughout the country, the licensor can either: 1) treat the silence as refusal of the tender and sue for breach of contract and infringement, or 2) treat the actions as acceptance and sue for the
                        price, ratifying uses within the contractual authority, but also sue for infringement as to uses or distribution outside the contract terms.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals only with treatment of copies and focuses on the effect of acceptance of a copy. It derives from Article 2 and Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) with changes reflecting the nature of
                            computer information.

                            General Effect of Acceptance. Acceptance of a copy is the reverse of refusing the copy. Acceptance obligates the accepting party to pay and render any other agreed performance with respect to that copy. Generally, however, as indicated in subsection (a),
                            unless acceptance occurs with knowledge of a defect under circumstances causing a waiver, acceptance of a copy does not waive the accepting party’s remedies. If there is a material, undiscovered defect in the copy or the information,
                            the licensee may have a right to revoke acceptance. Whether or not that is true, the licensee retains the right to sue for damages. The rule conforms to Article 2.

                            Burden of establishing. A party that has accepted a copy has the burden of establishing the breach. “Burden of establishing” has the meaning set forth in Uniform Commercial Code Article 1 (1998 Official Text), which is that the party must persuade the
                            trier of fact that the existence of the fact (e.g., breach) is more probable than its non-existence.

                            Notice of Breach. Subsection (c)(1) follows U.C.C. Article 2 (1998 Official Text) and provides that the party accepting the copy must notify the other party of the defect within a reasonable time or be barred from any remedy. This is a rule of fairness,
                            reflecting that the accepting party is in control of the copy and controls any issues with respect to it. It is also a rule of closure. At some point, the other party is entitled to conclude that the transaction has reached
                            a successful end. In the case of latent defects, the notice must be given within a reasonable time after the defect was or should have been discovered. What is a reasonable time is discussed in Section 117 [§ 59.1-501.17].

                            Nature of an Access Contract. There are many types of access contracts. In one there is no on-going relationship. This kind of access contract is like visiting a store: the customer is bound by the contractual rules in effect on the date of the visit.
                            There is no continuing relationship — if the customer visits the store again or obtains access again, the new visit is not part of the prior contract.

                            Basic Obligations. The basic obligation in a continuous access contract is to keep the system available in a manner consistent with contract terms and industry practices.

                                    Content Changes. Absent agreement to the contrary, an access contract does not bind the licensor to holding available particular computer information. Access is granted to the information or other resources provided as they exist at the time of the particular
                                    access. Databases may be added, modified or deleted consistent with this core obligation. Paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that. However, if the agreement was to make available specific information as indicated in an express
                                    term of the agreement, removing that information may breach the contract under paragraph (a)(2). A change that so totally alters the content of the access information that the licensee receives something entirely different
                                    from what the parties bargained for may be a breach if is not done in good faith. On the other hand, subsection (a)(2) confirms that good faith changes of content are a breach only if they conflict with an express term
                                    of the agreement giving assurance that no such changes would occur.

                                    General Standards of Availability. As indicated in subsection (a)(4), availability is subject to contract terms, but in the absence of such, the appropriate reference is to general standards of the industry involving the particular type of transaction.
                                    A contract involving access to an information service would have different accessibility expectations than would a contract to provide remote access to systems for processing air traffic control data. See Reuters Ltd.

                                    Use of Received Information. The access contract may or may not restrict use of the information obtained. If there are no restrictions in the agreement, subsection (a)(3) indicates that the information is received on an unrestricted basis, subject to
                                    intellectual property rights and any separate agreement concerning that information. For example, if an access contract enables access to news articles, but does not limit their use by the licensee, no limit exists
                                    other than under copyright or other applicable law (e.g., publicity rights).

                            Downtime. Subsection (b) indicates that, unless the agreement provides otherwise, occasional unavailability is expected as part of contracts of this type. Of course, this can be altered by agreement. Subsection (b) provides several common situations in
                            which unavailability can be expected; subsection (b)(2)(A) focuses on scheduled unavailability such as a period during which online activity may be suspended during a scheduled reconciliation of online account activity.

                        In a second, a continuous access contract, the licensee has a contractual right to access at times of its own choosing within periods of agreed availability or at times established in the contract. This relationship occurs in on-line services that operate
                        on a subscription or membership basis. The typical agreement is not only that the transferee receives the access or information, but that the resource be accessible on a continuing basis. A continuous access contract is unlike
                        installment contracts under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which are segmented into multiple tender-acceptance sequences. In continuing access contracts, a licensor merely keeps the system available for the licensee
                        to access when it chooses within the agreed times for access. This is a modern application of licensed use of resources.

                    <p>
                        If the access contract or a separate agreement place limitations on use of information obtained, those license terms would be governed under this Act. They are interpreted and enforced pursuant to other provisions of this Act and the terms of the agreement.
                        Once information is received by the licensee, the relationship is simply a license, if any, at that point. For example, if licensee uses the access provided by its access contract with ABC to acquire a copy of a spreadsheet program,
                        when the program is received by the licensee, the rights and remedies of the parties with respect to use of the program are governed by the agreement with respect to that program and, in the absence of agreed terms, by the rules
                        of this Act. As to the software, the relationship ceased to be an access contract when the software was received by the licensee. The terms of the license may be found in the agreement establishing the access contract or in a separate
                        agreement concerning the licensed information.

                        Restrictions are not necessarily based on a license. In some cases, a copyright notice restricts use of the information obtained through on-line access. Storm Impact, Inc. v. Software of the Month Club, 13 F. Supp.2d 782 (N.D. Ill. 1998).

                            Nature of Obligation to Correct Problems. There are three types of agreements that involve correction of performance problems. One arises where, as part of an effort to cure an existing breach, the vendor agrees to make specific corrections. That agreement
                            and the general concept of cure are not covered in this section. The second is where, as part of the original agreement, the licensor provides a limited remedy of replacement or repair of defects. That agreement is covered
                            under subsection (a)(1), which provides that the contractual obligation is to conform the product to the original contract. The third setting is where, as a separate undertaking, the licensor agrees to provide ongoing maintenance
                            services correcting problems which may or may not have been a breach of the original contract. This type of services agreement is covered in subsection (a)(2). These are contracts where a vendor agrees to be available to attempt
                            to correct problems in software for a fee. The contract is analogous to a maintenance or repair contract for goods. An agreement to provide updates or new versions, on the other hand, is like an installment contract to deliver
                            new versions as developed and made available. New versions may cure problems in earlier versions, but an update agreement deals with new products, while a maintenance contract entails correcting problems in an older product.
                            The standards by which the distinction is made focus on the factual context, the terms of the agreement, and general industry standards.

                            Services Obligation. Subsection (a)(2) deals with agreements for repair and maintenance of computer information. Most such agreements are services contracts. In the absence of contrary agreement, the rule on the contract obligation is stated in subsection
                            (a)(2). It parallels the obligation that any services provider undertakes: a duty to act consistently with the standards of the business to complete the task. A services provider does not guaranty that its services will yield
                            a perfect result, but rather that its performance will be characterized by a particular quality and effort to correct the problems. This section measures that by reference to standards of the relevant trade or industry. Of
                            course, if a particular problem covered by such an agreement is a breach of the original license agreement, this standard does not change that result.

                            Services in Lieu of Warranty. In some cases, an agreement to correct performance problems is part of a limited remedy or warranty and the promissor agrees to a particular outcome, such as a limited express warranty that includes a duty to repair the defective
                            product. The agreements are under subsection (a)(1). In these cases, the obligation is to repair the product such that it conforms to the contract. What performance conforms to the general contract to which the remedy relates,
                            of course, hinges on the terms of that agreement as interpreted in light of usage of trade, course of performance and the like. If the performance fails to yield a conforming product, the remedy for that failure depends on
                            other terms of the agreement, such as any right to provide a refund as an alternative to repair or replacement options and the rules in this Act.

                            Support Agreements. A support agreement is an agreement to provides advice or consulting services relating to the information. Subsection (b) provides a default rule regarding support agreements. The first sentence of subsection (b) is subject to the
                            existence of any warranty that might, in a particular transaction, establish an obligation to provide instruction materials or other support as part of the basic agreement. As a services contract, the appropriate standard is

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with three-party retail relationships involving a publisher, dealer, and end user. It only applies to retail distribution of tangible copies.

                            Parties. Subsection (a) contains three definitions that apply solely within this section. A “dealer” is a retailer or other distributor that receives information for redistribution, e.g., a retail store that stocks its shelves with copies of computer
                            information products. The term does not include a mere intermediary, such as a service provider, that creates an environment (electronic or otherwise) in which publisher and the end user deal directly to establish a license
                            or other transaction directly. The “end user” is the consumer or other person who acquires for use as opposed to re-distribution. A “publisher” is a licensor other than the dealer, e.g., the copyright owner who licensed the
                            dealer to distribute the information. For example, if a licensor of a word processing program distributes physical copies to Store for license to consumers, the licensor would be the “publisher,” the Store would be the “dealer,”
                            and the consumer would be the “end user.”

                            Dealer and End User. Subsection (b) addresses the dealer’s relationship with the end user. While the end user acquires the copy from the dealer, whether the dealer has authority to grant a right to use the work under copyright or other law is determined
                            by its contract with the publisher. In many retail distribution systems, that contract allows distribution only under specified conditions, which may include a requirement that the end user’s rights are subject to a publisher’s
                            license with the end user. Unlike in sales of goods law, under copyright law, the end user’s rights do not flow simply from delivery of the copy to it, but depend on the dealer’s compliance with the distribution license and
                            on the end user’s license from the publisher. Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Computers &amp; Electronics, Inc., 846 F. Supp. 208 (ED NY 1994). The rights to make and distribute copies are exclusive rights of the copyright owner
                            (the publisher), they do not pass to the transferee simply by delivery of a copy. Subsection (b) does not concern a case where the publisher sold or authorized sale of copies not subject to a license.

                                    Contracts Separable. Paragraph (b)(3) makes clear that the dealer is not bound by, nor does it benefit from, a contract between the publisher and end user unless the dealer and end user adopt those terms as part of their agreement. This follows case law
                                    on manufacturer warranties in other contexts, although that rule is overridden in some states and this Act does not alter those rules. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1791 (“as is” disclaimer). Warranties or other obligations
                                    of a dealer to the end user are not affected if the publisher’s license is accepted by the end user.

                                    Dealer as Licensor. The dealer is a “licensor” with respect to the end user. It has contractual obligations under this Act from its agreement with the end user; this does not mean that the dealer has the rights of the publisher that it can pass on to
                                    the end user. That the dealer has the obligations of a licensor as to the end user corresponds to ordinary retail expectations. As a result, the end user licensee may have recourse against two different parties, the
                                    dealer and, if the end user agrees to the license, the publisher.

                                    Conditional Rights. Under subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2), the dealer’s agreement with the end user hinges on the end user’s ultimate rights to use the information supplied. This depends on the license between the publisher and the end user. If the end user
                                    declines the publisher’s license, can obtain a refund from the dealer. This is a right, rather than merely an option.

                            Dealer and Publisher. Often the publisher’s agreement with the dealer is a license that retains ownership of copies in the publisher and permits distribution only subject to an end user license. The legislative history of the Copyright Act indicates that,
                            whether or not there was a sale of the copy, contractual restrictions on use are appropriate under contract law. “[The] outright sale of an authorized copy of a book frees it from any copyright control over . . . its future
                            disposition . . . . This does not mean that conditions . . . imposed by contract between the buyer and seller would be unenforceable between the parties as a breach of contract, but it does mean that they could not be enforced
                            by an action for infringement of copyright.” H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 79 (1976). See DSC Communications v. Pulse Communications, 170 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999), cert. den. 528 U.S. 923 (1999).

                    <p>
                        The agreement may create different relationships. One might treat the publisher’s license as part of the dealer’s contract which the end user and dealer understood from the outset would be provided to complete the terms of the relationship. This is an
                        application of the right, recognized in commercial law, of parties to make a contract leaving it to one party to supply particulars of performance after the initial agreement, with the specifications in this case coming in the
                        publisher’s license. Where the arrangement is that assent to these later particulars is required and the end user rejects the terms, it in effect is also rejecting the contract with the dealer and is entitled to return the copy
                        and receive a refund. Agreement here, as in other respects, does not depend solely on express terms, but can be found or inferred from the circumstances surrounding the contracting, applicable usage of the trade, in course of dealing
                        and the like.

                            Scope of the Section. This section applies to risk of loss of copies; it does not apply to access contracts and does not deal with other risks of loss, such as loss of the information itself or of informational rights. The section does not alter rules
                            of this Act about passage of title or tender of delivery.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.14-officialcomment.1ol12">
                            Basic Approach. Which party bears the risk of loss is determined by the agreement and, in the absence of agreement, by standards that focus on the transaction rather than on title to copies or tender of delivery. This rule is subject to variation by agreement.
                            Agreement may be found in express terms, course of dealing, usage of trade or inferred from the circumstances of the contracting. Absent contrary agreement, risk of loss generally lies with the person in possession or control
                            of the copy. It passes from one party to the other on receipt of the copy or control of it, unless another rule governs under this section or the agreement.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.14-officialcomment.1ol13">
                            Electronic Transfer. If a copy is transferred electronically, risk of loss passes to the recipient when the copy is received. The recipient should have no risk regarding the loss of a copy that has not yet been received where electronic transmissions
                            are, in effect, virtually instantaneous. The risk of loss during transmission is on the sender. The transferor who sends the copy electronically also retains a copy that could be used for retransmission. This rule does not
                            concern when tender of delivery occurs.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.14-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Delivery of Physical Copies. Subsection (b) deals with transactions involving transfer of a tangible copy to be shipped. The rules are from U.C.C. Article 2 (1998 Official Text). They distinguish between a shipment contract (Section 606(b)(2)) [§ 59.1-506.6(b)(2)]
                            and a destination contract (Section 606(b)(3)). Most shipments of tangible copies are shipment contracts. “Duly delivered” in a shipment contract requires that the sender tender the copy to the carrier pursuant to an appropriate
                            contract with the carrier.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a06s59.1-506.14-officialcomment.1ol15">
                            Delivery without Moving the Copy. Subsection (c) deals with transfers accomplished without moving a copy. Risk of loss transfers when the transferee receives the ability to control the copy or when it receives access materials to access the copy. These
                            rules correspond to U.C.C. Article 2 (1998 Official Text) but are updated for where the transaction entails electronic access from which a copy can be obtained.

                            Nature of Excuse. Subsection (a) conforms to Uniform Commercial Code § 2-615 (1998 Official Text) and adopts the policies reflected in that section, but applied to both parties. A party is excused from timely performance of a contractual obligation if
                            that performance becomes commercially impracticable due to unforeseen events not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. The standard of excuse does not apply to an obligation to pay or to follow
                            restrictions in contractual use terms. See Section 601 [§ 59.1-506.1], Comment 2 and 3. The requirement to perform payment obligations does not displace general law on the effect of governmental regulations as an excuse for
                            a payment obligation. The section does not address that issue, leaving its resolution to common law.

                            Allocation Rules. Subsections (c) and (d) are based on Article 2 and limited to contractual obligations to deliver copies. Under subsection (c), the licensor is required to make an allocation of the copies available for delivery among its customers and
                            its own requirements. A licensor that has a partial excuse under this section must fulfill its contract to the extent that the overriding contingency permits. If the events affect its ability to supply its customers generally,
                            this section allows the licensor to take into account the needs of all customers and of itself when fulfilling its obligation to one customer as far as possible. This may include customers not then under contract. However,
                            good faith requires that, in cases of doubt, current contract customers should generally be favored. Except for such considerations, the standard here is intended to leave open reasonable business leeway to the licensor.

                            Rights of Other Party. The interests of a party faced with a material or indefinite delay are protected in subsection (d). The party may either accept the proposed allocation or treat the contract as terminated as to executory obligations. The latter
                            option does not allow treating the case as involving a breach, but merely permits termination. If the party fails timely to accept the proposed modification, under subsection (e), the contract lapses as to the relevant performance.

                        Increased cost does not excuse performance unless the increase is due to an unforeseen contingency that alters the essential nature of the performance obligation and that cannot reasonably be viewed as within the contingencies that were foreseeable in
                        the original agreement. A rise or a fall in the market or market prices is not in itself a justification. Market and cost fluctuations are the type of business risk which commercial contracts cover. Similarly, if the agreement
                        calls for development of new technology, no excuse arises if the agreed development itself proves to be technologically impossible or excessively costly. That risk is inherent in a development agreement and is assumed to be allocated
                        in the basic contract. However, if both parties proceeded on the assumption that a third-party technology would be completed, but this does not occur and renders the project impossible, the agreement may have been based on an assumed
                        fact or occurrence that did not ensue and an excuse may be appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Excuse doctrine does not apply if, under the agreement, the party seeking to claim an excuse agreed to assume the risk. Such agreement can be found not only in express terms of the contract, but in the circumstances of the contracting, trade usage, course
                        of dealing and the like. The exemptions of this section do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently foreshadowed at the time of contracting to be included among the business risks which are fairly to be regarded
                        as part of the contract terms, either consciously or as a matter of reasonable commercial interpretation from the circumstances.

                            Scope of the Section. Termination means ending a contract other than for breach. This section describes the effect of termination and lists some obligations that survive termination unless otherwise agreed. The list is not exclusive.

                            Executory Obligations. An executory obligation is one that is not fully performed on both sides. If the prior performance of one party earned a reciprocal performance (e.g., payment or delivery), termination does not affect that earned reciprocal performance.
                            If the obligations of one or both parties are partly, but not fully completed, the obligation is executory for purposes of this section if the unperformed part is such that a failure to perform it would be a material breach
                            excusing the other party’s obligation to perform. Minor remaining acts typically would not leave an obligation executory, but material remaining performance does.

                            Survival Rules. Subsection (b) lists terms and rights that survive termination. The list presumes that the surviving obligation was created in the agreement and identifies terms that parties ordinarily would designate as surviving. The intent of this
                            list is to provide background rules, reducing the need for specification in the contract. Of course, the parties may delete or add terms by agreement, which agreement can be found in express terms or in the circumstances surrounding
                            the contracting, in trade usage, in course of dealing and the like. Upon termination, various other rights may be vested and not executory: these also survive by application of the standard in subsection (a).

                            Termination on the Happening of an Event. No notice is required for termination based on an agreed event (e.g., the end of the stated license term). This follows Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and common law. The parties
                            are charged with awareness of agreed terms; in cases covered by this rule, they agreed that the contract would expire on the happening of an objectively ascertainable event. No notice is needed when this event occurs.

                            Notice in Other Cases. Except as stated in subsection (b), termination based on discretion of one party, such as an “at will termination”, requires that reasonable notice be given. What notice is reasonable varies with the circumstances. For example,
                            where the reason for termination involves suspected unlawful conduct or a desire to prevent harmful acts, notice at or promptly after termination will ordinarily suffice; in such cases, notification may consist of the inability
                            to further access the computer information. In less exigent or harmful circumstances, giving prior notice ordinarily may be required. The notice requirement when there are no exigent circumstances and there is no material breach
                            gives the other party an opportunity to make other arrangements and to avoid use of the information after termination that may result in breach of contract or infringement of intellectual property rights.

                            Access Contracts. Under subsection (c), termination of an access contract does not require notice even if based on exercise of discretion by the terminating party. Of course, the termination must be allowed by the contract. An access contract gives contractual
                            rights to access a resource owned or controlled by the licensor. When the contract terminates, the access privilege terminates. This rule is consistent with common law for a license of this type. This section provides a limited
                            exception to the common law rule, when the access contract involves information that is provided to the licensor and owned by the licensee, such as when a licensee has provided its employee list for storage on a computer of
                            the licensor that is accessed under license to the licensee. In that case, notice is required. What is meant here is ownership of the information. Thus if a customer provides information to effect a transaction, or if the customer
                            has previously provided information to the licensor for other transactions, the customer transactional information is not owned by the customer to whom it refers and the exception does not apply.

                            Contract Modification. Subsection (c) corresponds to U.C.C. Article 2 (1998 Official Text). Under subsection (c), a notice requirement may be waived or the terms, timing and other aspects of notice may be specified by agreement. The subsection places
                            two restrictions on this principle.

                        The party terminating the contract must give notice, but a requirement that notice be received would create uncertainty that is undesirable where the terminating party is merely exercising a contractual right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, an agreed waiver of notice is enforceable only if enforcement of the term is not unconscionable. This rule permits contractual waivers of notice, but allows a court to police exercise of the right thus created if that exercise is unconscionable.
                        The focus is not on the term in this context, but on its operation. This rule does not apply where the agreement sets standards for notice of termination. For an application of this concept, see Intergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp.,
                        195 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Zapatha v. Dairy Mart, Inc., 381 Mass. 284, 408 N.E.2d 1370, 1375 (Mass. 1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, standards set by agreement for notice of termination are enforceable unless they are manifestly unreasonable. This rule permits flexibility in an agreement, but allows a court to reject clearly abusive terms. It does not allow invalidation simply
                        because application of the standard causes an undesirable result when viewed in retrospect.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with obligations arising on termination of a license. The section does not deal with cancellation for breach or with transactions other than a license. For cancellation, see sections 802, 815 and 816 [§§ 59.1-508.2,
                            59.1-508.15 and 59.1-508.16].

                            Obligation to Return. Subsection (a) states the unexceptional principle that, on termination of a license, a party (licensor or licensee) is entitled to return of any materials that it owns or that the contract requires to be delivered at the end of the
                            relationship. This is a contract right. The obligation is to use commercially reasonable effort. In some cases, circumstances may delay return. A reasonable effort, however, does not encompass intentional or knowing retention
                            of copies. Similarly, subsection (b) makes clear that use of the information after the contract terminates is a breach of contract, the remedy for which survives the termination.

                            Terminating Rights of Use.  Termination of the license ends all rights of use pursuant to the license except those rights that by agreement survive or are irrevocable. This rule corresponds to prior law and reflects the conditional nature of the rights
                            established under a license. Continued use not authorized by the license breaches the contract. If intellectual property rights are involved, such use may also be an infringement. Since termination does not entail actions in
                            response to a breach of contract, no provision is made for limited use to mitigate damages. Compare Section 802 [§ 59.1-508.2].

                        Whether a party is in breach of contract is determined by the agreement or, in the absence of agreement, this chapter. A breach occurs if a party without legal excuse fails to perform an obligation in a timely manner, repudiates a contract, or exceeds

                            Material Breach and non-material Breach. This Act follows common law: a party’s contractual remedies are determined by whether a breach is material or immaterial. Both types of breach entitle the aggrieved party to remedies, but a material breach gives
                            a right to cancel the contract.

                            What is a Breach? What is a breach of contract is determined by the agreement or, in the absence of agreement, this Act. A party must conform to the contract. A breach occurs if a party acts in a manner that violates the agreement or fails to act in a
                            manner required by the contract. This includes but is not limited to a failure timely to perform, a breach of warranty, a repudiation, non-delivery, wrongful disclosure, uses in violation of the contract, exceeding restrictions
                            in contractual use terms, and other breaches.

                            What is a material breach? Parties are entitled to the performance for which they bargain. Any breach of contractual obligations entitles the other party to damages as appropriate. Beyond that, this Act adopts the rule in common law and international
                            law distinguishing between material and immaterial breaches. Some breaches are so immaterial that they do not justify cancellation of the contract. In such cases, it is better to preserve a contract despite minor problems than
                            to allow one party to cancel and thereby risk an unwarranted forfeiture or unfair opportunism. Materiality depends on the agreement; the agreement can either define a type of breach as material or it can simply state that the
                            remedy of cancellation exists. Failing contract delineation, what is a material breach depends on the circumstances. A failure fully to conform to promises about the capability of software to handle 10,000 files may not be
                            material if the licensee’s use will not exceed 4,000 files and the software is able to handle 9,000 files. Materiality is judged from the aggrieved party’s perspective in light of the nature of the bargain and the benefits
                            expected from performance of the contract.

                            Contract Terms. An agreement may determine what is a material breach by express terms that either give a right to cancel for a particular breach or provide that a particular type of breach is material. Of course, a court must interpret that agreement
                            in light of general principles. Thus, a term providing that any failure to conform to any contract term permits cancellation should be interpreted in light of commercial context that includes usage of trade, course of performance,
                            or course of dealing, unless clearly refuted by the circumstances. Section 116(c) [§ 59.1-501.16(b)]. That context may indicate that minor breach of some terms are nonetheless not adequate for cancellation.

                            What Remedies Apply? If a party’s performance breaches the contract, the aggrieved party is entitled to its remedies. The remedies depend on the nature of the breach and any remedy limitations. All remedies are generally available for material or non-material
                            breach, except the remedy of cancellation. The aggrieved party can cancel the contract only if the breach was material as to the entire contract. For either type of breach, there is an intermediate remedy in that a party whose
                            expectations of future performance are impaired may suspend performance and demand adequate assurance of future performance from the other. Section 708 [§ 59.1-507.8].

                            Relation to Intellectual Property Rights. Subsection (a) makes it clear that this Act does not alter intellectual property rules about whether a breach also constitutes an infringement or misappropriation. Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 188
                            F3d 1115 (9th Cir., 1999) (distinguishing scope and breach of a covenant). In an appropriate case, where there is no double recovery, a party may have remedies under both contract and intellectual property laws. Kepner-Tregoe
                            Inc. v. Vroom, 186 F.3d 283 (2nd Cir., 1999).

                    <p>
                        A statute cannot define materiality with precision, but can give appropriate reference points. Subsection (b) provides three: contract terms defining materiality, a substantial failure to perform an essential term, and a breach causing substantial harm
                        to the aggrieved party or a denial of a reasonably expected significant benefit. This last consideration, of course, refers to substantiality in context of the agreement itself. Thus, in a contract for a ten dollar software license,
                        a breach causing ten dollars of harm would be material even though, in a thirty million dollar license, a ten dollar loss should be immaterial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The list in subsection (b) is not exclusive. When the contract is silent this section should be interpreted in light of common law and the Restatement. See
                        <i>
        Rano v. Sipa Press,
       </i> 987 F.2d 580 (9th Cir. 1993);
                        <i>
        Otto Preminger Films, Ltd. v. Quintex Entertainment, Ltd.,
       </i> 950 F.2d 1492 (9th Cir. 1991). Common law concepts preclude forfeiture for minor breaches; thus in the absence of agreement about a term, materiality hinges on substantial denial to the aggrieved party of the advantages
                        (consideration) it sought from the transaction. The
                        <i>
        Restatement (Second) of Contracts
       </i> § 241 (1981) lists five factors: 1) the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit he or she reasonably expected; 2) the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for the
                        benefit of which the party will be deprived; 3) the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture; 4) the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure
                        the failure, taking into account all the circumstances, including any reasonable assurances; and 5) the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and
                        fair dealing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The agreement might indicate that conforming to a specific requirement is a precondition to the performance of the other party. That condition should be enforced. The express condition defines part of the remedy: breach allows the aggrieved party not
                        to perform simply because the express condition for its performance is not met.
                    </p>

                        <b>
        Illustration:
       </b> In a software development contract, the contract expressly conditions acceptance of the product on its meeting ten conditions. One condition is that it must operate at “no less than 150,000 rev. per second.” The software
                        does not meet that condition. Failure to meet the condition justifies refusal of the product.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with waivers. A “waiver” is a voluntary relinquishment of a known right. The section brings together rules from common law and from Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text).

                            Waivers in a Record. Waivers made in a record to which a party agrees, including by a manifestation of assent, are enforceable without consideration. This follows modern law. See Uniform Commercial Code § 2A-207; Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 277.
                            The rule in subsection (a) does not preclude other forms of waiver, but merely confirms that waivers within it are effective.

                            Waiver by Accepting a Performance. Subsection (c) deals with waivers resulting from accepting a performance without objecting to known deficiencies in it. Waiver stems from conduct and knowledge of the defect coupled with silence beyond a reasonable time.
                            This type of waiver does not apply if the party merely knows a performance is not consistent with the contract. The defective performance must have been tendered to and accepted by that party. Failure to object to uses that
                            violate a license but pertain to performance not delivered to the other party is not a waiver. In some cases, of course, it may result in an estoppel.

                        <li id="t59.1c43a07s59.1-507.2-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Failure to Particularize. Refusal of a performance does not place the refusing party at risk if it does not state reasons for its refusal. There is no requirement that the party particularize the reasons for the refusal. Under subsection (d), however,
                            a waiver results from a failure to particularize if the other party could have cured the problem had it been seasonably given the basis for refusal, or, between merchants, if the breaching party asks for a specification in
                            a record of the reasons for refusal and a basis for refusal is not listed among the reasons. This adopts Uniform Commercial Code § 2-605 (1998 Official Text) and should be interpreted to correspond to that section. The rule
                            is grounded in fairness: the aggrieved party is obligated to provide notice to the other party of defects reasonably known to the aggrieved party, but the aggrieved party does not waive defects that were later-discovered.

                            Scope of Waiver. Under subsection (e), absent express agreement or circumstances clearly indicating to the contrary, a waiver applies only to the specific breach waived and does not alter remedies for future breaches. This principle does not alter estoppel
                            concepts; a waiver may create justifiable reliance as to future conduct in an appropriate case.

                            Retracting a Waiver. A waiver cannot be retracted with respect to past events whose consequences were waived. This principle is important in continuing relationships. It allows aggrieved parties to waive particular defects in performance without forfeiting
                            rights as to future performances.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        A party presented with deficient performance is not required to elect between accepting or entirely refusing it. Subsection (c) permits the party to preserve its rights by (1) giving notice of objection to the deficiency within a reasonable time, or accepting
                        the performance and giving prior notice that it does so while reserving its rights. The first option comes from Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text). The second is from Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial
                        Code (1998 Official Text). Of course, the party in appropriate cases may simply refuse the performance.

                        A waiver as to future events supported by consideration cannot be unilaterally retracted. Such waivers constitute a bilateral agreement. On the treatment of waivers supported by consideration, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 84, comment f. All
                        other waivers as to executory portions of a contract may be retracted as to future events unless retraction would be unjust in view of a material change in position in reliance on the waiver. See Section 303 [§ 59.1-503.3], Comment

                            Scope of the Section. This section establishes an opportunity to cure a breach and retain a contractual relationship. For licensees, cure often involves acts to correct missing or delayed payments or failure to timely give required accounting or other
                            reports. For licensors, cure often focuses on timeliness of performance and adequacy of a delivered product. This section sets limits on the opportunity to cure that balance the goal of preserving contract relationships and
                            the goal of giving the injured party the full benefit of its bargain. Subsection (b) creates a new, limited duty to cure in cases where the injured party was required to accept a copy because the breach was not material as
                            to that copy.

                            General Idea of Cure. The idea that a breaching party may preserve the contract if it acts promptly to eliminate the effect of breach is embedded in modern law. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 237. However, there is significant disagreement about
                            the scope of allowed cure, reflecting different balances drawn between the policy of allowing a party to preserve a contractual relationship and policies that protect the valid expectations of the aggrieved party. Compare UNIDROIT
                            International Principles of Commercial Contract Law art. 7.1.4; Convention on the International Sale of Goods art. 48.

                            Right to Cure. This section generally allows cure if it is prompt and avoids harm to the aggrieved party. Cure is not an excuse for faulty performance, but rather an opportunity to avoid loss and retain the benefits of the contract for both parties. Cure

                                    Expectation that performance would be acceptable. A party in breach has an opportunity to cure if it had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the original tender would be acceptable. Thus, payment of eighty percent of the amount due would create an opportunity
                                    to cure only if, from prior performance, the tendering party had reason to believe that tender would be acceptable. That reason can arise from prior course of dealing, course of performance or usage of trade, as well
                                    as the particular circumstances surrounding the contract. The party is charged with knowledge of factors in a particular transaction which in common commercial understanding require strict compliance with contractual
                                    obligations, but can also rely on course of dealing and usage of trade regarding variation of performance unless these have been clearly refuted by the circumstances, including the terms of the agreement. If the other
                                    party gives notice either implicitly through a clear course of dealing, or through terms requiring strict performance, those indications control this section. Requirements in a standard form that are not consistent
                                    with trade usage or the prior course of dealing and are not called to the other party’s attention may be inadequate to make unreasonable any expectations consistent with trade usage or course of dealing.

                                    Cure subject to other person’s actions. Outside of the settings described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), the opportunity to cure is limited by the aggrieved party’s right to insist on performance and, under paragraph (a)(3), cure must occur before the
                                    aggrieved party cancels the contract. This puts control in the aggrieved party. As indicated in subsection (c), the aggrieved party is not required to withhold cancellation simply because of a notice of intent to cure

                            What is a Cure. Cure requires the completion of acts that put the aggrieved party in essentially the position that would have ensued on conforming performance. Cure requires a party to perform the contract obligation and to compensate fully for loss.
                            Monetary compensation may be required, but money is a cure only if provided in addition to full performance, such as tender of a conforming copy or tender of a late payment with any required late payment charges. Cure does
                            not occur merely because one party announces its intention to cure, even if that intention is held in good faith. Cure only occurs when or if the proposed compensatory and conforming actions are completed.

                            Effect of Cure. Cure of a breach does not mean that the aggrieved party must accept without remedy less than conforming conduct. The effect of cure is that a contract cannot be canceled based on the cured breach. The aggrieved party retains its remedies
                            under the agreement or this Act.

                            Duty to Cure. Subsection (b) applies to cases outside the mass market where a licensee must accept a copy because there is no material breach even though breach occurred. It creates an obligation to attempt to cure. The defect must, of course, constitute
                            a breach of contract. Failure to undertake a required effort to cure is a breach of contract, but failure to correct the problem having attempted to do so is not a breach. The obligation to attempt a cure is limited by proportionality.
                            No obligation exists if it would entail costs disproportionate to the direct damages caused by the nonconformity. Thus, if a party delivers a one thousand name list for $500 that omits five non-material names in a context where
                            that omission is a breach and where the omission reduces the value of the list by a small amount, the party has no obligation to cure if obtaining those additional names would be disproportionate to the direct damages. In such
                            case, the proper remedy is the difference in value (if any) of the copy rendered and the performance promised.

                    <p>
                        There is a right to cure before the time for performance expires. Paragraph (a)(1). A party whose early performance was a breach can make a good tender within the contract time. What is the time for performance is determined by the agreement at the time
                        of performance, including any enforceable modifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cure requires seasonable notice of an intent to cure. The closer that the time of the breach is to the contractual time for performance, the greater is the necessity for promptness in notice and completing the cure. What is seasonable notice depends on
                        the context, including the importance of the expected performance and the timing and difficulty of obtaining substitutes. The notice is not the cure. Cure occurs when conforming performance is tendered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In mass market cases governed by Section 704(b) [§ 59.1-507.4], refusal of the single copy that forms the basis of the transaction may be cancellation because the entire transaction focused on rights in that copy. No special notice or words of cancellation
                        are required. Even if refusal is not, in the circumstances, equivalent to cancellation, a defect in a copy provided under Section 704(b) [§ 59.1-507.4] gives a right to cancel. If the provider, when notified of refusal, gives notice
                        that it intends to cure, under subsection (a)(3) the licensee can either agree to allow that or can refuse to do so and at that point cancel by refusing any offered cure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some contract breaches cannot be cured. This is true, for example, if a party breaches a contract by publicly disclosing licensed trade secret information. In such cases, the damage done cannot be reversed and cure is inapplicable. A similar condition
                        may arise where the agreement demands performance on a specific date or hour, but the party materially fails to meet the deadline. Cure is an opportunity to avoid ending a contract relationship by bringing the performance into
                        line with the other party’s rightful expectations. It does not allow a breaching party to avoid the consequence of breaches that have significant irreversible effects.

                            (the copy). Acceptance of a copy does not generally waive the party’s rights to a remedy for breach. What is acceptance of a copy is dealt with in Section 609 [§ 59.1-506.9].

                            appropriate standard for cancellation; the rules of subsection (a) and Section 601 [§ 59.1-506.1] apply.

                            Effective Refusal. Under subsection (c), refusal of a tender is ineffective if the refusing party does not timely notify the other party of its refusal. This precludes arguments that silent refusal can be effective or coupled with use of the information.
                            The rule corresponds to waiver rules in common law and this Act. The refusal is effective if it occurs within a reasonable time after any permitted, but ineffective effort to cure. Refusal is not permitted after breach has
                            in fact been cured.

                            Refusal and Cancellation. Many transactions involve commitments that go beyond delivery of a particular copy. Subsection (d) confirms that an aggrieved party that refuses tender of a copy may cancel the contract only if the breach is a material breach
                            of the entire contract or the agreement so provides. Cancellation of the entire contract requires breach that is material as to the entire agreement, or a contract term that allows cancellation.

                    <p>
                        Refusal is the reverse of “acceptance” of a copy. A decision to refuse a tender of a copy ordinarily requires refusal of all of the tendered copies. However, a licensee may accept some tendered commercial units (copies) and reject the rest, if the commercial
                        units are separable in light of the contracted performance. For example, if the licensor tenders thirty copies and ten are defective, the commercial unit is the copy and the licensee can accept the thirty and refuse the remainder.
                        On the other hand, tender of a copy of a single program with ten modules that are defective and thirty not, does not involve multiple commercial units; the tender must be refused in whole or not at all. This section does not permit
                        a party to disassemble an integrated or composite product. The part accepted (or refused) must be a commercial unit as intended by the party tendering it; the issue is not whether some of the product could have been provided separately,
                        but whether, as provided pursuant to the agreement, it was a separable commercial unit. As with all performance, partial acceptance must be in good faith and conform to standards of commercial fair dealing.

                    <p>
                        While sometimes described as a “perfect tender” rule, the “conforming tender” rule does not require tender of a “perfect” product, but merely one that conforms to the contract. What conforms to the contract depends on the agreement, including express
                        terms as interpreted in light of usage of trade, course of dealing and concepts of merchantability. The relationship between refusal under subsection (b) and the ability to cure a defect is discussed in Section 703 [§ 59.1-507.3],
                        Comment 4(b).

                            Scope of the Section. The section distinguishes (1) agreements where a grant to use informational rights vests independently of any copy, and (2) agreements where the purpose is to obtain informational or other rights associated with a copy. It applies
                            to the first context.
                        </li>

                            Effect of Breach. In transactions of this type, refusal of a defective copy does not necessarily permit cancellation of the contract. The contractual grant of rights (already vested) is an independent, performed part of the agreement; any particular copy
                            used to implement that grant is a mere conduit. If the defective tender of a copy does not materially breach the entire contract, the tendering party has a right to cure. That right is cut off only if tender and a failed or
                            delayed cure constitute a material breach of the whole agreement. Similarly, the aggrieved party has a right to retain its rights but refuse the copy: refusal of a copy does not alter the vested rights.

                            Nature of the Transaction. The section applies only if the contract vests the right to use informational rights without the transferee’s receipt of a copy. Whether this is the nature of a particular contract depends on the agreement. If there is a vested
                            rights transaction, the parties view a copy as a mere conduit to complete an already vested grant. In such cases, a defect in one copy is not necessarily material to the entire contract; a licensee can refuse the copy and retain
                            the contractual rights. In contrast, if the contract is only for rights associated with a copy, a licensee that refuses the copy is left solely with an action for damages; refusal in essence cancels the contract.

        Illustration 1.
       </b> IBM grants licensee (LE) the right to distribute twenty thousand copies of its software in the United States during one year. Several weeks later, IBM delivers a master disk of the software to LE. The master disk contains
                        a manufacturing flaw. The contract is within this section. LE can refuse the copy if the defect was material as to the copy, but cannot cancel the entire contract unless the defect and the delay was material to the entire contract.
                        IBM can cure by timely tendering a conforming copy. LE can recover damages, if any.

                        this section since there was no vested right to use informational rights independent of the copy to be delivered.

       </b> Prince D’s estate grants LE an exclusive license to show still photographs of Prince D on an Internet website for one week during the first anniversary of Prince D’s death, also giving LE the right to advertise the
                        exhibit. A copy of the photographs is to be delivered one week before the first showing. The copy is delivered several days late and is technically defective. It cannot be used. LE refuses the copy. The contract is within this
                        section because the grant of rights is independent of the copy.

                            Cancellation and Refusal. Refusal of a copy may or may not result in canceling the contract. Upon cancellation, Section 802 [§ 59.1-508.2] controls to the extent of any inconsistency with this section. If the contract is not canceled, this section applies

                            No Right to Use. In general, a refusing party has no right to use the refused copies or any copies made from them. Uses inconsistent with this section or the contract are a breach and may, in appropriate cases, be treated as acceptance of the tendered
                            copies. Despite this, limited use for mitigating loss due to the other party’s breach may be permitted. The use must be solely to mitigate and does not extend to uses more appropriately viewed as acceptance of the copy; use
                            also cannot entail disclosure of confidential information, violation of a restriction in a contractual use term, or sale, licensing, or other transfer of the copies. This section asks courts to reach the balance reached regarding

                            Handling Copies. The refusing party has no right to sell or otherwise dispose of information, documentation or copies under any circumstance. The information may be confidential or subject to overriding proprietary rights held by the other party. There
                            is no commercial necessity to sell that copy to a third party to avoid commercial loss because the copy is not the relevant value in the transaction; the transaction focuses on the information.

                            Restrictions in Contractual Use Terms. Both parties remain bound by restrictions in contractual use terms, including confidentiality obligations. See Section 812 [§ 59.1-508.12], Comment 4. It is not uncommon that each party have some such information
                            of the other; a mutual, continuing restriction is appropriate to the extent allowed by applicable trade secret or other law. The restrictions relate only to the information acquired under and subject to the license. This does
                            not restrict the party’s ability to obtain the same information from alternative lawful sources independent of the contract restrictions.

                            Relationship to Section 802 [§ 59.1-508.2]. On rightful refusal or revocation of acceptance of a copy, the Section 706 [§ 59.1-507.6] rules apply unless the contract has been rightfully canceled. In that event, the Section 706 rules apply to the extent
                            not inconsistent with Section 802 [§ 59.1-508.2].

                        Cancellation requires that both parties promptly disengage from the contract, returning any material previously received and refraining from any use that would have been allowed under the license. Cancellation ends the license. On the other hand, refusal
                        without cancellation presumes that the contract continues, although the refused copy and related material will be returned to the tendering party, or any defect cured. Of course, the continued effectiveness of the contract is subject
                        to the aggrieved party’s remedies for breach under this Act and the agreement.

                    <p>
                        The limited ability to use for purposes of mitigation is also subject to the requirement that the use not be contrary to instructions received from the other party regarding disposition of the information. Instructions that have the effect of preventing
                        use for purposes of mitigation are, in effect, a waiver of the right to insist that mitigation in this form occur. The instructions must, of course, be given in good faith and generally are subject to a standard of commercial reasonableness.

                            Scope of Section. This section corresponds to Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2A-516; 2-608 (1998 Official Text). It deals only with revocation of acceptance of a copy. Revocation returns the parties to the same position as if the copy had been refused. It
                            is equivalent to rescission. The revoking party is no longer liable for the price of the copy and, in appropriate circumstances, can obtain a refund. A “return” described in Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2] is not relevant in this
                            section because it refers to rights on rejecting a contract, not refusing a copy tendered pursuant to a contract.

                            Conditions for Revocation. Revocation is appropriate only for material defects that would have justified refusal had the defect then been known. This is true even in mass market licenses. Acceptance of a copy ordinarily establishes closure of the transaction
                            with respect to the copy. That expectation cannot be altered based on minor defects. For this purpose, the general standards of material breach apply. This rule follows Article 2 and Article 2A (1998 Official Text). Under subsection
                            (b), effective revocation requires notification of the other party.
                            <ol type="a">

                                    Expectation of Cure. Revocation may be permitted if acceptance was on the assumption of cure. See paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2). Parties may engage in a mutual effort to resolve problems within the contract, rather than by ending it.
                                </li>
                                <li id="t59.1c43a07s59.1-507.7-officialcomment.1ol12b">
                                    Adjustment and Effort to Cure. Paragraph (a)(2) deals with a common issue. In cases of joint continuing efforts to adjust the computer information to fit the contract or otherwise be acceptable to the licensee, both parties know that problems exist. This
                                    paragraph encourages and supports such joint efforts. The licensee willing to jointly participate in the effort may revoke acceptance if the effort fails within a reasonable time and if other conditions barring revocation
                                    do not arise.
                                </li>

                                    Latent Defects. Paragraph (a)(3) follows Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and permits revocation if the defect was not discovered before acceptance because of the difficulty of discovery or inducement by the other party that
                                    had the effect of delaying discovery.

                    <p>
                        Revocation is inappropriate if based on a defect in the copy or information of which the accepting party was aware when it accepted the copy. This follows Article 2. Acceptance with knowledge of a defect does not eliminate other remedies unless it creates
                        a waiver, but does bar revocation based on the defect unless conditions mentioned in subsection (a) are present. These deal with two different circumstances:

                        This section corresponds to Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) and should be interpreted in that light but with recognition of the different nature of computer information transactions. Subsection (2) refers to contractual use
                        restrictions. If the licensee is the aggrieved party, it may seek adequate assurances of performance and suspend its own performance. However, any restrictions in contractual use terms continue to apply. Insecurity does not change
                        the contract.

                            General Scope. This section states general rules on contract remedies. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, the effect of the rule can be varied by agreement.

                            Cumulative Remedies. Contract remedies seek to put an aggrieved party in the position that would have resulted if performance had occurred as agreed. The remedies in this Act are cumulative to the extent consistent with that general goal. This Act rejects
                            any concept of election of remedies. However, the parties by agreement may alter a remedy or make it unavailable. The agreement governs unless expressly invalidated by this Act.

                            Aggrieved Party Choice. In litigation, an aggrieved party chooses the remedy, subject to substantive limitations under this Act or the agreement.  The court does not control the choice.
                        </li>

                            Remedies Retained. This Act is supplemented by general law, including equitable remedies. Section 114 [§ 59.1-501.14:1]. Similarly, a remedy for contract breach does not displace a right under intellectual property law. Damage awards are limited by the
                            principle that prohibits double recovery for the same wrong, but often the two forms of recovery refer to different damages and are not a double recovery.

                            Contractual Use Terms. Breach does not eliminate restrictions in contractual use terms — both parties remain bound by them — but breach may end rights under the use terms. For example, a licensee licensed to distribute computer information cannot continue
                            to do so if the licensor cancels the license because of the licensee’s breach, but restrictions, such as limitations on disclosure, continue to apply. Those restrictions relate to information acquired under and subject to the
                            license and do not restrict the party’s ability to obtain the same information from alternative lawful sources independent of the contract restrictions.

                            Cancellation. “Cancellation” is a remedy under which one party ends the contract for breach. Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2]. Cancellation discharges executory obligations, but does not alter rights earned by prior performance or established by breach.

                            When Permitted. Cancellation is permitted if the agreement so provides or if there is a material breach of contract. What is a material breach depends on the agreement or the nature or effect of the breach. Section 701 [§ 59.1-507.1].  A material breach
                            does not require that the aggrieved party cancel.  That party may continue to perform, demand reciprocal performance, and collect damages.  If it does not cancel and the breaching party cures the breach, cure precludes cancellation

                            Notification. Subsection (b) requires notification to make the cancellation effective. Section 102(a)(49) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)(49)]. This contrasts to existing Article 2. Notification must be interpreted in light of the circumstances and does not require
                            proof that the notice is received. Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2].  The party harmed by the breach is not required at its risk to choose a fail-safe notification procedure. Notification is not required to cancel an access contract.

                            Effect on Use Rights. Many licenses permit the licensee to use, access or take other designated actions without being sued for infringement by the licensor. When a license is canceled, that defense dissolves. A licensee who continues to act in a manner
                            inconsistent with intellectual property rights of the licensor may face an infringement claim. Whether or when this occurs is determined by applicable information property and contract law. Sun Microsystems v. Microsoft Corp,
                            188 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 1999).

                            Obligations Regarding Copies. Cancellation ends the contractual permission to use information and, in a license, contractual permission to retain copies of licensed information. Subsection (c) sets out some of the consequences of that result. However,
                            subsection (c)(4) allows limited use by the licensee in a case where the licensee cancels because of the licensor’s breach. This right is solely for purposes of allowing mitigation. See comments to Section 706 [§ 59.1-507.6].
                            It does not create an implied license, but merely a limited contractual remedy premised on the principle that there is a duty to act reasonably to avoid loss in the event of breach. Use outside of that principle is wrongful.

                            Effect on Obligations. All obligations executory on both sides at the time of cancellation are discharged, but any right based on previous breach or performance and the rights, duties, and remedies described in Section 616(b) [§ 59.1-506.16(b)] survive
                            unless otherwise agreed. To survive, of course, the right itself must exist at the time of cancellation. Rights previously waived or excused because of breach do not survive. Section 601(b) [§ 59.1-506.1(b)].

                            “No cancellation” clause. Especially where information is licensed for inclusion in a product and significant investments are needed to create or distribute the product, contractual terms often provide that the licensor cannot cancel for breach. The clause
                            does not alter other remedies. Section 803 [§ 59.1-508.3], comment 4b. However, it ensures that if the licensee continues to distribute the product, it does not infringe. When parties agree to this type of remedy limitation,
                            that term should be enforced. In a consumer or other contract where the performance is delivery of an acceptable copy, a contract term that prohibits cancellation does not alter the consumer’s or other transferee’s rights,
                            since they still retain all rights to sue for damages and to refuse the tendered product.

                        If a party has a right to cancel, the equities favor the injured party, not the party in breach. Thus, no formalities of notice are required. It is sufficient that the aggrieved party by its actions or words communicate that the contract has ended. Thus,
                        in a contract calling for a single delivery of a copy, the decision to refuse the copy, return it, and demand a refund is sufficient notification. Commencing a judicial proceeding gives notice. The aggrieved party is not required
                        to use formal terminology or procedures or to give a notice prior to taking an act that itself gives notice.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with agreed limitations on remedies for breach.  It does not deal with the right to a return defined in Section 102 [§ 59.1-501.2] and used in Sections 113, 209 and 613 [§§ 59.1-501.13:1, 59.1-502.9 and 59.1-506.13].
                            That is not a remedy for breach, but a procedure on declining contract terms. “Return” as used in this section does not refer to that right, but to a remedy for breach and is not a “return” as in Section 102(a) [§ 59.1-501.2(a)].

                            Agreement Controls. Parties may by agreement fit their remedies to their particular deal. This is fundamental to contract practice and defines the cost of a transaction. A party that agrees to accept all liability for breach will charge more than a party
                            that contractually limits liability. Similarly, a party may not be willing to acquire a product unless it obtains particular remedies and recourse. How parties order these choices depends on the agreement, but no principle
                            of commercial contract law suggests that parties’ ability to control these issues should be precluded.

                            Exclusive Remedies. An agreed remedy may modify or replace otherwise available remedies, or it may give an additional right. To be an exclusive remedy that displaces other remedies, the agreement must expressly so provide. This follows Article 2 of the

                                    Replacement, Repair and Refund. Agreed limited remedies that refer to replacement, repair, or refund are common. The three different terms, however, indicate different remedies: replacement refers to supplying another copy of the same product, repair
                                    obligates the party to eliminate defects that cause nonconformance with the contract, and refund usually obligates it to return the price already paid for the defective performance. The purpose of a “replacement” or
                                    a “repair” obligation is to limit remedies, but also to provide the licensee with an information product that fulfills contract obligations. The purpose of a “refund” remedy is to reimburse the amount paid for the defective
                                    performance and to limit damages.

                                    No Cancellation. Subsection (a) refers to an agreed term that bars cancellation for breach, but allows exercise of other remedies. This is important for cases of a licensee that commits resources to develop and distributes a product based in whole or
                                    part on information rights licensed to it, or in other cases where continued use of the computer information is critical to the licensee. The ability to bar cancellation by agreement is important in this commercial
                                    environment where the licensee may devote great resources to development of a further product based on the originally licensed information or may predicate a business model upon it. Section 802 [§ 59.1-508.2], comment.
                                    The remedy limitation does not affect consumers since other remedies remain in force (refusal, recoupment, damages) that fully protect the consumer. This is also true for commercial end users. Waiver of a right to cancel
                                    does not bar enforcement of the license or other rights under it (such as the right to damages for breach or for specific performance).

                                    Failure of Remedy. Under subsection (b), if performance of an exclusive remedy causes it to fail of its intended purpose, it no longer limits the remedies of the aggrieved party. This is the rule in Article 2. Courts must ask what was the purpose of the
                                    agreed remedy. A different purpose exists for remedies limited to replacement or repair, and remedies that include a remedy consisting of a refund right. In the absence of a refund remedy, the purpose is to provide
                                    a functioning product. In cases where the remedy includes a right to a refund, the purpose is to return money that was paid for the defective performance. Performance by giving a refund fulfills the purpose of a refund
                                    remedy if a party that did not receive a conforming performance receives the agreed refund. This contrasts to an agreement in which the remedy requires replacement or repair, but not a refund. In that case, the agreed
                                    remedy contemplates a functioning product. Non-performance of the remedy leaves the licensee without what it bargained for under the contract, a functioning product.

                                    Related to Consequential Damage Limits. Subsection (c) deals with the effect that failure of a limited remedy has on agreed limits on consequential damages. The issue is whether one agreed term (exclusion of consequential damages) depends on, or is independent
                                    of, another agreed term (limited remedy). This section provides that the two terms are dependent on each other unless the agreement expressly indicates otherwise. This rule rejects cases under Article 2 of the Uniform

                                    expressly independent of the other limited remedy. If the agreement expressly states that the terms are independent, there is no reason in principle to preclude enforcement of that agreement.

                            Minimum Adequate Remedy. An agreed remedy provision does not fail because the court believes that the remedy does not afford a “minimum adequate remedy.” Doctrines of unconscionability, fundamental public policy and for determining whether mutuality of
                            obligation exists for a binding contract set a floor on what agreed terms are binding with respect to remedies.

                            Consequential Damage Limits. Disclaimer or limitation of consequential damages is generally enforceable. See U.C.C. Article 2-715, comment 3 (1998 Official Text). In consumer transactions involving defective computer programs embedded in consumer goods
                            that cause personal injury, however, this section follows Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998, Approved Draft) and makes disclaimer of personal injury damages prima facie unconscionable. Under Section 103(b), some
                            computer programs embedded in goods are not governed by this Act but by Article 2, which has the same rule. This section does not create liability that would not exist under other law. Most cases reject personal injury claims
                            against information providers even under tort law. This reflects that, for information products, courts balance public interests in encouraging distribution of information against interests in creating new sources of recovery.
                            This Act does not alter the analysis that courts using general theories of tort law should make under that body of law.

                        In many transactions, refund refers to the price paid for a single copy. Other transactions entail ongoing royalties or other fees, including fees for services additional to furnishing the product (such as support or maintenance). Nothing in this section
                        restricts the ability of parties to agree to a refund of a fixed maximum amount or portion of the expected contract fee or to exclude or include moneys paid for other services. Refund usually contemplates the payments for the product,
                        not payment to cover all value received.

                        Except as otherwise agreed, a consequential damage limitation covers all obligations and remedies under the contract. Remedy clauses are part of the overall transaction. A consequential damages limitation applies to all loss except as otherwise expressly
                        stated in the contract.

                        However, the essence of any contract is that parties accept the legal consequences of their deal and that there be at least a fair quantum of remedy in the event of breach. Contracts that do not do so may fail for lack of consideration or mutuality. This
                        does not mean that a court can rewrite the agreement or the agreed remedies. If a remedy is provided and is made exclusive, the fact that it does not fully compensate the aggrieved party is not a reason to allow that party to avoid
                        the consequences of its agreement. Remedy terms are agreed allocations of risks. For example, a contract that limits recovery for software defects used in a satellite system to the price of the software (e.g., $100,000) is not
                        unenforceable because the defect caused loss of a $1 million satellite. A decision to set a limit affects pricing and risk and cannot be set aside because the loss eventually fell on one party. On the other hand, a contract that
                        states “licensee will have no responsibility for any harm to licensor caused by licensee’s intentional breach of any aspect of the agreement” may lack mutuality to establish a contract.

                            Scope of the Section. This section deals with liquidated damages clauses. The basic rule is that agreed terms are enforceable unless unreasonable.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.4-officialcomment.1ol12">
                            General Standard. A liquidated damages contract term sets both a minimum and maximum recovery. A liquidated damages term is, in concept, no different than any other contract term. The presumption is that courts enforce agreed terms. Subsection (a) provides
                            that liquidated damages terms are enforceable if the amount is reasonable in light of 1) before-the-fact estimates of likely damages, or 2) after-the-fact actual damages, or 3) the difficulty of proof. Basically, the term is
                            enforceable unless there is no reasonable basis on which to sustain it. A liquidated damage clause chosen based on the parties’ assessment of risk and cost should be enforced. Courts should not revisit the deal after the fact
                            and disallow it because the choice later appeared to disadvantage one party. If the parties actually negotiated the clause, that clause is per se reasonable. Actual negotiation, however, is not essential to enforceability.

                            Remedies On Unenforceability. If a liquidated damage term is not enforceable, the aggrieved party may pursue the remedies it has under this Act in the absence of the term. Those remedies may be limited by other agreed terms. For example, if the contract
                            excludes consequential damages, the aggrieved party remains bound by that exclusion even if the liquidated damages term is unenforceable.

                            Other Terms. A term that is not a liquidated damage clause but a limitation on damages, is governed by Section 803 [§ 59.1-508.3], not this section. Thus, a term that provides: “In no event shall either party be liable for damages exceeding $1 million
                            dollars,” is a limitation on damages governed under Section 803 because it limits recovery but does not guaranty a recovery of any particular amount unless the facts support damages in that amount.

                            Limitations Period. Subsection (a) bars a cause of action brought more than four years after the breach occurs, but adopts a discovery rule that may extend the time for bringing a cause of action up to five years from the time of breach. The period to
                            bring the lawsuit is between four and five years, depending upon when breach occurred or should have been discovered.

                            Effect of Agreement. Subsection (b) limits the enforceability of agreements that modify the limitations period. The statute of limitations reflects public policy about how long of a period may be permitted before law concludes that no action may be brought.
                            Subsection (b) precludes agreements that permit a period of limitations longer than that stated in the Act. This does not prevent “tolling agreements” entered into during disputes. It only precludes extensions in the original
                            agreement.

                            Accrual of Cause of Action: Time of Performance. The four year term refers to four years from when the right of action accrues. This section applies two rules for when the cause of action accrues. The primary rule is subsection (c). The cause of action
                            accrues when the breach occurs or should have been discovered. For an alleged breach of warranty, this generally occurs on delivery of the information or service, even if the defect does not become apparent until much later.
                            Warranties are breached or not on delivery of the warranted subject matter.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.5-officialcomment.1ol15">
                            Traditional Discovery Rule. Subsection (d) describes cases in which the time of occurrence rule is replaced entirely by a traditional time of discovery rule. Each concerns circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to define breach as occurring
                            when performance is delivered because the breach is never manifested until later and because the assurances involved in the contract obligation go to events beyond the time of delivery.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) also precludes reducing the limitations period to less that one year. This does not affect contracts that limit a warranty to a stated period of less than one year (e.g., ninety days). Such agreements define the warranty itself. They state
                        the period during which discovery of a defect or the occurrence of its effect must occur (e.g., product has no defects manifested during the first ninety days). Unless the agreement so states, this does not limit the time in which
                        a lawsuit may be brought. However, such agreed terms control when the cause of action accrues and whether there is a breach since they provide that a defect that is not manifest during this time is not a breach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some cases, however, a warranty expressly “extends to future conduct.” For example, if a warranty is that there are no defects that affect performance during the first ninety days after delivery, subsection (c) gives the terms of this language their
                        effect. Breach of the warranty occurs if a defect appears within the stated warranty term. Subsection (c) rejects cases holding that such a warranty changes the limitations rule to a pure “discovery” rule, i.e., the cause of action
                        does not accrue until the defect is or should have been discovered. If the warranty is for a limited time (e.g., one year), the breach cannot occur later than the expiration of that stated time.

                            Scope of the Section. This section brings together general rules on computation of damages.  Specific rules for licensor damages (Section 808 [§ 59.1-508.8]) and licensee damages (Section 809 [§ 59.1-508.9]) are subject to the general principles stated
                            here.

                            Mitigation. Subsection (a) requires mitigation of damages and places the burden of establishing a failure to mitigate on the party asserting the protection of the rule. “Burden of establishing” means that the party with the burden must persuade the trier
                            of fact that the existence of the fact is more probable than its non-existence. Uniform Commercial Code § 1-201(8) (1998 Official Draft).

                            Published Informational Content. Subsection (b) excludes consequential damages for issues about the content of “published informational content.” Whether characterized as a First Amendment analysis or treated as a question of social policy, our culture
                            has a substantial interest in promoting the dissemination of information. This Act supports and encourages distribution of informational content to the public.

                            Speculative Damages. This Act does not require proof with absolute certainty or mathematical precision. Consistent with the principle of Article 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text) that there be a liberal administration of the remedies
                            of that Code, the remedies in this Act must be administered in a reasonable manner. However, this does not permit recovery of losses that are speculative or highly uncertain and therefore unproven. See Restatement (Second)
                            of Contracts 352 (“Damages are not recoverable for loss beyond the amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty.”). No change in law on this issue is intended; courts should continue to apply
                            ordinary standards of fairness and evaluation of proof. For an illustration in an information transaction, see Freund v. Washington Square Press, Inc., 34 N.Y.2d 379, 357 N.Y.S.2d 857, 314 N.E.2d 419 (1974).

                            Confidential Information. Subsection (c) confirms that one way of measuring loss in the case of confidentiality breaches is in terms of the value obtained by the breaching party. In essence, where a confidential relationship exists, the party to whom
                            the confidentiality obligation is owed has an expectation of the information not being misused and that expectation is entitled to protection. Compensation for such loss is important. However, if the breach of confidence gives
                            benefits to a third party that do not inure directly or indirectly to the party to the contract, recovery against the third party is under other law. The rule stated here, of course, is also subject to the prohibition on double
                            recovery. Section 801 [§ 59.1-508.1].

                            Market Value. If market value is part of a damages computation, subsection (d) requires that market value be determined at the time and place for performance. Where performance is delivery of a copy, the place is as indicated in the agreement or this
                            Act. In other cases, such as an Internet transaction that provides access to an information system, the nature of the subject matter makes geographic touchstones difficult to determine or inappropriate. In such cases, courts
                            may refer to rules on choice of law in Section 109(b) [§ 59.1-501.9(b)] this Act, which provide a stable reference point relevant to and protective of both parties.

                            Present Value. Subsection (e) provides that damages as to future events are awarded based on present value as of the date of judgment. The definition of “present value” corresponds to Uniform Commercial Code §§ 2A-103;

                            particular point in time. This requires, as to damages awarded for eventualities that are in the future, that courts do so based on a present value standard. As to losses and expenses that have already occurred, the present
                            value measurement does not apply. No change in law on pre-judgment interest is intended.

                        The idea that an injured party must mitigate its contract damages permeates contract law. Contract remedies are not punitive but compensatory. The injured party cannot act in a way that enhances loss and expect to have that loss compensated in damages
                        recoverable from the other party. This does not create an obligation of an aggrieved party to cover. The damages formulae in Sections 808 and 809 [§§ 59.1-508.8 and 59.1-508.9] contain various means of adjusting damages by statutory
                        measures that in effect are a surrogate for mitigation (e.g., the statutory formulae based on market value of the performance). If the formula is used to compute damages, whether there was a actual mitigation is not relevant.

                    <p>
                        The reference in subsection (a) to otherwise provided in the agreement includes contractual liquidation of damages. An enforceable liquidated damages term creates an agreed measure of damages. A court may not reduce or alter that contractual measure based
                        on its determination about whether actual damages were adequately mitigated or not.

                        As indicated in the definition of published informational content, the context is one in which the content provider does not deal directly with the data recipient in a special reliance setting. Information of this type is typically low cost and high volume.
                        Dissemination of such information would be seriously impeded by high liability risk. With few exceptions, modern law recognizes the liability limitations even under tort law. The Restatement of Torts, for example, limits exposure
                        for negligent error in data to intended recipients and to “pecuniary loss” which corresponds to direct damages.

                        The subsection does not exclude all consequential damage claims relating to published informational content. For example, if a party agrees to provide content for distribution over the Internet, but fails to deliver in a timely fashion, the resulting
                        damages claim does not pertain to the content itself, but to the failed performance. Whether consequential loss is recoverable is determined under the general standards of this Act, the agreement of the parties, and common law.

                        the data were incorrect. If C were in a relationship of reliance with D, consequential loss is recoverable. But this is published informational content, and C cannot recover alleged consequential loss.

                        In determining market value, due weight must be given to any substitute transaction actually entered into by a party, taking into account the extent to which the transaction involved terms, performance, information, and informational rights similar in
                        terms, quality, and character to the agreed performance. See Comments to Section 808(a) [§ 59.1-508.8(a)].

                            Scope of the Section. This section states how to measure damages for a licensor if the licensee breaches the contract. Under Section 807, damage awards related to events in the future are based on the present value at the time of the award.

                            General Approach. A licensor may choose any measure of damages described in subsection (b), subject to the limitation on double recovery. The basic approach assumes that the aggrieved party chooses the method of computation, subject to judicial review
                            of whether the choice creates double recovery. No order of preference is required. Subsection (b)(1) measures “direct damages” by the difference in value between performance promised and received. When appropriate, direct damages
                            also include reimbursement for value already given and for which payment has not yet occurred. The damages are capped by the contract fee for the performance and the market value of other consideration to be received. This
                            does not include the loss of expected benefits from use of the expected performance in other contexts. If recoverable, those are consequential, not direct damages.

                            Intangible Subject Matter: Substitute Transactions. Licensor remedies differ from remedies for sellers in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Article 2 focuses on an assumption that the seller’s loss lies in the sale of the particular item. For
                            computer information transactions, the particular copy is not ordinarily relevant. The basic issue is whether breach enables a substitute transaction that could not have otherwise occurred and which is properly considered in
                            determining direct damages.

                                            Recovery Measured by Contract Fee: Substitute Transaction Enabled. Under paragraph (b)(1)(B), damages are measured by unaccrued contract fees and other consideration less the value of any actual or hypothetical “substitute transaction” made possible by
                                            the breach. Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7] requires computation at present value for losses associated with events occurring after judgment. Speculative damages are not recoverable. Restatement (Second) of Contracts

                                            Recovery Measured by Lost Profits. Under paragraph (b)(1)(C), damage recovery is measured by lost profits caused by a failure to accept performance or by repudiation of the contract. Unlike in Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text),
                                            this Act does not require proof that alternative measures of damages are inadequate to compensate the licensor. The injured party chooses the method of computation. As with contract fees, lost profits must be
                                            proven with reasonable certainty and may not be speculative. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 352. Similarly, recovery is subject to the general duty to mitigate. See Section 807 and Krafsur v. UOP, (In re

                                    Consequential and Incidental Damages. The licensor is also entitled, in an appropriate case, to recover consequential and incidental damages. The section distinguishes between contract fees and royalties on the one hand (as direct damages) and consequential
                                    damages on the other. Section 102, comment 11. The damage recovery is also subject to the general provisions of Section 801 and 807 [§§ 59.1-508.1 and 59.1-508.7].

                            Remedies under Other Law. The licensor may have remedies under other law, including intellectual property law. Breach introduces the possibility of an infringement claim if, for example, (a) the breach results in cancellation of the license and the licensee’s
                            continuing conduct is inconsistent with the licensor’s informational rights, or (b) the breach consists of acting outside the scope of the license and in violation of the informational right. Remedies under informational rights
                            laws do not displace contract remedies provisions since they deal with different issues. The two remedies may raise dual recovery issues in some cases. The general rule is that all remedies are cumulative, except that double
                            recovery is not permitted.

                        Damages under this section are subject to the general principles of this Act. Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7] disallows recovery of consequential damages in some cases, including where claims are speculative or are for the content of published informational
                        content. Under Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7], also, recovery may be limited by the requirement that the aggrieved party act in a reasonable manner to mitigate loss.

                    <p>
                        The idea of a “substitute transaction” is a central concept. A transaction is not a substitute transaction simply because in it the transferor used a diskette that might have been used to deliver the same information to the original licensee. The focus
                        is on the information, not the tangible media, and on contractual use terms. To be a substitute transaction, the transaction must involve the same information under the same use terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To be a “substitute transaction” the transaction must have been made possible by the breach. This rule requires that a substitute transaction must be possible. If there is no market and no alternative licensee for the same information product under the
                        same terms, no substitute is possible. That will often occur when the contract is to develop software for a particular application of the licensee. Also, the rule requires that, if a transaction is possible, the licensor’s ability
                        to engage in it must be due to the breach and not simply because another transaction would have been possible in any event. For example, in the case of a breach of a non-exclusive access contract by the licensee, there would ordinarily
                        not be a substitute transaction because the licensor has almost unlimited capability to make access available to others. While another access contract may subsequently occur, that contract was not made possible by breach — the
                        new license would have occurred with or without the breach. More generally, in most non-exclusive licenses, breach does not enable a new transaction. On the other hand, cancellation for breach of an exclusive license to distribute
                        a work in a geographic area may enable the licensor to make a substitute license in that area that could not otherwise have been made because of the exclusive nature of the breached license.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recovery for unaccrued (future) fees and consideration is reduced by due allowance for proceeds of a “substitute transaction.” This is measured either by an actual substitute transaction or by the market value of a commercially reasonable
                        <i>
        hypothetical
       </i> transaction. The substitute transaction must have been made possible by the breach. If breach makes possible a substitute transaction, but no transaction actually occurs, recovery sought under this paragraph is reduced
                        by the market value (if any) of the hypothetical substitute transaction made possible by the breach. As with actual substitute transactions, market value must assume a market for the same use restrictions for the same information
                        over the same contract terms.

        Illustration 1:
       </b> LR licenses a master disk of its software to LE allowing LE to make and distribute 10,000 copies. This is a nonexclusive license. The fee is $1 million. The cost of the disk is $5. LE wrongfully refuses the disk and
                        repudiates the contract. Under (a)(1)(A), LR would recover $1 million less the $5, as also reduced by due allowance for (1) any substitute transaction made possible by this breach and (2) by any other failure to mitigate. However,
                        (a)(1)(B) would ordinarily not apply since a second 10,000 copy license is not a substitute transaction if the license was not made possible by the breach. Recovery under subsection (a)(1)(C) is computed by assessing lost profit
                        including reasonably attributable overhead.

        Illustration 2:
       </b> Same as Illustration 1, but the license was a worldwide exclusive license. On breach, LR makes an identical license with second LE for a fee of $900,000. This transaction was made possible because the first exclusive
                        license was canceled. LR recovery under subsection (a)(1)(B) is $100,000 less any net cost savings not accounted for in the second transaction. If there was no actual second license, but the market value for such a license was
                        $800,000, the recovery is $200,000 less any net cost savings not accounted for in the hypothetical market value.

        Illustration 3:
       </b> LR grants an exclusive U.S. license to LE to distribute copies of LR’s copyrighted digital encyclopedia. This is a ten-year license at $50,000 per year. In Year 2, LE breaches and LR cancels. Recovery is the present
                        value of the remaining contract fees with due allowance for any actual or hypothetical substitute transaction made possible by the breach.

                            Scope and General Structure of the Section. This section states how to measure damages for a licensee if the licensor breaches the contract. The basic approach is that the aggrieved party chooses the method of computation, subject to judicial review of
                            whether the choice creates double recovery. Damages awarded for future events are based on present value at the time of the award. Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7].

                            Direct and Consequential Damages. Subsection (a)(1) measures direct damages. Direct damages are capped by the market or contract value of the performance plus restitution of fees paid for which performance was not received. Market value refers to what
                            would be the fee in a similar transaction for the performance. Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7] provides when and where “market value” is determined.

                            Computation. Subsection (a) provides for recovery under the formulae stated in that section less expenses saved as a result of the breach to the extent those are not otherwise reflected in the formula. All damages under this section are subject to general
                            principles of this Act, including Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7] and concepts of mitigation, and Section 116 [§ 59.1-501.16], including supplemental principles of equity such as concepts of mitigation and the prevention of economic
                            waste.

                                    Lost Value in Accepted Performance. Paragraph (a)(1)(A) provides for recovery for a performance accepted when the acceptance is not revoked even though the performance was defective; this covers any breach of contract, including a breach of warranty.
                                    Direct damages are measured by the difference in the contract price and the actual value received. If software with a value of $10,000 was to be delivered, but because of a defect, the value was $9,000, this yields
                                    a recovery of $1,000 if the licensee accepts and keeps the software. Value is generally measured by the contract fee. Recovery for any loss that exceeds that amount is consequential damages. This allows recovery based
                                    on the cost of repairs incurred to bring the product to the represented or warranted quality, if those costs are commercially reasonable and incurred in good faith.

                                            Recovery of Fees. The licensee is entitled to recover any fee paid for which performance was not received. Performance has not been received if the licensor fails to make a required delivery or repudiates, if the licensee rightfully refuses or justifiably
                                            revokes acceptance, or if the performance was executory at the time the licensee justifiably canceled. This paragraph allows restitution of amounts paid for such undelivered performance.

                                            to replace that performance with a reasonable substitute, but also reflect the differences on this issue between sales of goods and transactions in computer information. Recovery is reduced by the amount of
                                            any expenses saved as a result of the breach. Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7] requires that market value be determined as of the time and place for the performance.

                        “Direct damages” are the difference in market value between the performance promised and performance received, not counting lost expected benefits from anticipated use of the expected performance. This rejects cases such as Chatlos Systems, Inc. v. National
                        Cash Register Corp., 670 F.2d 1304 (3d Cir. 1982), cert. dism.,

        National Cash Register Corp. v. Chatlos Systems, Inc.,

                        are consequential, not direct damages.

                        Paragraph (B)(iii) allows cover as a way to fix damages and avoid further loss. In this Act, recovery can be computed based on a commercially reasonable cover with the same contractual use terms as the original contract. In administering damage claims
                        based on cover, however, courts must recognize differences between this remedy in goods transactions and in information commerce. If the information not delivered can be obtained from numerous other sources, the similarity between
                        goods and information is strong. On the other hand, in many contexts, the information may not be available from any other source. In such cases, obtaining a replacement involves obtaining different information. The different information
                        is cover only if the similarities are so close and without differences in cost that their use as a measure of damages is clearly appropriate. This allows cover using commercially reasonable substitutes, but does not allow different
                        information or information obtained under different contractual use terms. Use terms define the product and its price. They are sufficiently material that differences in such terms means that a different product is involved. If
                        this occurs, recovery is under “market value” standards. For example, while a licensee can cover for a breach in delivery of a word processing program by obtaining a different program as a commercially reasonable substitute, that
                        version cannot be obtained under a perpetual license if the original program was under a one year license.

        Illustration 1:
       </b> LE contracts for a 1,000 person site license for database software from LR. The contract fee is a $500,000 initial payment and $10,000 for each month of use. The duration is two years. LE makes the first payment, but
                        LR fails to deliver. LE cancels and obtains a substitute system under a three year contract for $500,000 and $11,000 per month. It is entitled to refund of the $500,000 payment plus recovery of the difference between the contract
                        price ($240,000 computed to present value) and the market price for the software. The court must determine to what extent the second transaction defines market value given differences in terms of the license, the nature of the
                        software, and other relevant variables. The replacement is not a cover because of the differences in contract terms.

        Illustration 2:
       </b> Same facts as in Illustration 1, but after breach LE obtains a license for LR software from another authorized distributor for a $600,000 initial fee under other terms identical to the LR contract. Since the new contract
                        is for the same information under the same terms, LE has recovery of its initial payment, the $100,000 price difference, and any recoverable incidental or consequential damages.

        Illustration 3:
       </b> Assume that, rather than being completely defective, the database system lacks one element that was promised. While LE could refuse the software, it elects to accept the license. It sues for damages. The issue is establishing
                        the difference in value between the system as contracted and the one delivered, in light of the contract price. Assume the difference is $150,000. LE recovers that amount as direct damages, along with any recoverable incidental
                        or consequential damages.

                            Scope of the Section. This section codifies the right of recoupment. Recoupment, as contrasted to set-off, allows self-help by recovering money owed through withholding payments due under the same contract. This section does not deal with set-off. The
                            section derives from Section 2-717 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text), but expands it.

                            Basic Standard. Recoupment permits one party to deduct damages resulting from the other party’s breach from payments owed to that party. The breach must be of the same contract under which the payment in question is being withheld. Exercise of the right
                            requires notice to the other party. In the absence of notice, withholding payments is a breach. Withholding payments may provide cause for insecurity and a right to demand assurances under Section 708 [§ 59.1-507.8].

                            Non-material Breaches. Subsection (b) limits recoupment in cases of nonmaterial breach. This limit applies only if the breach was non-material as to both the particular performance and the entire contract. A failure to deliver a shipment is outside the
                            limit since it is material as to that performance. On the other hand, if only a minor problem exists, the balance of interests shifts. In such contracts, allowing self-help reduction of payments creates a risk of overreaching
                            by the party withholding payment without a clear justification for doing so.

                            violate fundamental policy of the state.

                                    Personal Services. Specific performance cannot be ordered for a “personal services contract.” An individual cannot be forced to perform against the individual’s will. Determining what is a personal services contract requires a court to look at the nature
                                    of the agreement and what was to be provided pursuant to it. A contract for a named individual of superior skill or artistry to perform a particular task is a personal services contract. Breach gives a right to damages,
                                    but not a right to specific performance enforceable by contempt powers against the individual. If a corporation agrees to provide services, on the other hand, the contractual obligation may not constitute personal services
                                    because any person in the corporation can perform. Of course, even if the contract does not involve personal services, this section does not require or necessarily permit an award of specific performance unless the
                                    other conditions are met.

                                    Unique Subject Matter. Specific performance can only be ordered if the performance is “unique” or “in other proper circumstances.” The test of uniqueness requires that a court examine the commercial situation. The test requires a commercially realistic
                                    interpretation of the performance. Despite the often unique character of information, respect for a licensor’s property rights and confidentiality interests will often preclude specific performance of an obligation
                                    to create or a right to use the informational property unless the need is compelling. See Lubrizol Enterprises, Inc. v. Richmond Metal Finishers, Inc., 756 F.2d 1043 (4th Cir. 1985). Specific performance may be appropriate
                                    to prevent misuse or wrongful disclosure of confidential material because breach cannot be adequately responded to by an award of damages. Such cases are one illustration of the “other proper circumstances” referred
                                    to in this section.

                            Conditioning the Order. The terms of an order of specific performance are within the discretion of the court. While subsection (b) recognizes this, it provides an important protection for confidential information where performance might jeopardize interests
                            in confidential information of a party. Confidentiality and informational rights must be adequately protected in any specific performance award.

                            Scope of the Section. This section parallels Uniform Commercial Code Section 2-704 (1998 Official Text). It gives the licensor options for proceeding after breach by the licensee, which options are constrained by the general duty to mitigate damages.

                            Right to Identify Copies to the Contract. The right to identify conforming copies to the contract is applicable where the licensor intends to rely on the measure of damages involving comparison of the contract fee with the fee received in a substitute
                            transaction for the same information. It will be less common in computer information transactions than in sales of goods because breaches regarding information licenses often do not result in this type of damages computation.

                            Right to Complete Unfinished Information. The licensor can complete the information or exercise its other options under subsection (a)(2) in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment in light of the facts as they appear at the time. If commercially
                            reasonableness is contested, the burden is on the licensee to show the commercially unreasonable nature of the licensor’s action just as it would be under Section 807 [§ 59.1-508.7], if the licensor elected not to complete
                            and the allegation was that the licensor failed to mitigate loss.

                            Contractual Use Terms. Breach does not invalidate restrictions in contractual use terms, but may void rights under those use terms. For example, a licensee’s right to distribute copies is eliminated on breach if the licensor cancels the license, but restrictions
                            on use, such as a limit on disclosure, continue to apply to both parties. Unless otherwise agreed, those restrictions, however, relate only to the information subject to the license. They do not restrict a party’s ability to
                            obtain the same information from alternative lawful sources.

                            Scope of the Section. This section applies only to licenses canceled for breach. The aggrieved party has a right to recover licensed information and prevent further use by the breaching party. The remedies are analogous to Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial
                            Code (1998 Official Text). They are limited by the restrictions in Section 816 [§ 59.1-508.16].

                            Rights Recognized. In a license, the licensor retains overriding rights in the information. Cancellation of the license gives it an immediate right to prevent further use and retake the property conditionally made available to the licensee. The aggrieved
                            party can obtain (1) possession of all copies of its information, and (2) when appropriate, an injunction against further use. On cancellation, the injured party has a right to preclude any further benefits to the breaching
                            party. Merely returning copies may not achieve that result. The rights here, of course, apply only to information or copies provided under the license or made from licensed material. Information properly obtained from another
                            source does not come within the provisions of this section.

                            Self-help. Subsection (b) allows a right of self-help to repossess the tangible copy without breach of peace and in that regard corresponds to Article 2A and Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (1998 Official Text). In contrast, Section 816 prohibits
                            electronic self-help under this Act. Repossession of a tangible copy is permitted unless there is a cancellation for breach so long as the repossession does not “breach the peace”. Article 9 decisions are relevant on what is
                            a breach of the peace. Subsection (b) makes clear that, having taken possession of the copy properly, the aggrieved licensor can erase it, but cannot destroy information that must be returned to the licensee.

                            Expedited Hearing. Subsection (d) gives each party a right to an expedited hearing to enforce or protect rights. This enables early judicial review, reducing the risks associated with non-judicial repossession and the risks associated with information
                            misuse. The section does not specify the timing required. This is left to state procedural law.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.15-officialcomment.1ol15">
                            Identifiability. Under subsection (e) there must be some identifiable thing with reference to which possessory rights can apply. A right to possession does not exist if the information has been so commingled as to be unidentifiable. This includes cases
                            where data are thoroughly intermingled with data of the other party and that intermingling occurs in ordinary performance under the license. In such cases, repossession is impossible due to the expected performance under the
                            contract.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This limit does not apply to the right to prevent use; it only means that a right to separable repossession of the information will not exist. For example, if trade secrets were provided to the licensee under contractual use terms, the ability to prevent
                        further use hinges on whether a particular activity can be identified as use of the information. If an image, trademark, name or similar material is inseparable from property of the party in breach such as when it is incorporated
                        into a product, that fact does not preclude the aggrieved party from preventing further use of the information. Thus, a license that allows use of an image in a video game does not prevent the licensor from barring use of the image
                        in that game after breach even if the image is inseparable from the game. Of course, any prior authorized distribution of copies is not altered or impaired by subsequent cancellation.

                            Scope of the Section. This section prohibits electronic self-help under this Act, denying a licensor a remedy to enforce its rights in the event of a breach by the licensee.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.16-officialcomment.1ol12">
                            Self-Help for Breach. Electronic self-help deals with use of electronic means to prevent use of the computer program after the licensee commits a breach of sufficient seriousness that it allows the licensor to cancel the contract. The use of electronics
                            to enforce a remedy for breach under this Act is precluded. The section does not deal with use of electronic restraints to prevent breach by limiting the licensee’s performance to the terms of the contract or to the use of
                            electronics when a license terminates by its own terms or otherwise without breach.
                        </li>

                            Non-waiver. The limitations under this section cannot be waived by agreement before breach.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.16-officialcomment.1ol14">
                            Off-setting Rights. Electronic means of enforcing rights on breach are an efficient method of enforcing contract law rights that are important for small licensors that may be unable to litigate effectively against large licensees, such as a one-person
                            developer who licenses software to a multi-national insurance company. Nevertheless, under this section, the developer is precluded from exercising electronic self-help under this Act. The section does not interfere with the
                            licensor’s right to cancel the license upon material breach (subject, of course, to the license terms) and the breaching licensee does not have any right to continue to use the program after cancellation. As part of the decision
                            to ban electronic self-help under this Act, Section 816 [§ 59.1-508.16] provides for an award of attorneys fees for the prevailing party and an expedited hearing on the issuance of an injunction to effect, by court order, the
                            actual cessation of use that would have been effected through electronic self-help but for the ban in this section.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t59.1c43a08s59.1-508.16-officialcomment.1ol15">
                            Other Law. Nothing in this section alters the rights of a seller, lessor or a secured party to take possession or render goods unusable without removal and without judicial process if that can be done with no breach of the peace (see e.g., UCC §§ 2A-525;
                            9-609 (directly or via 2-401)) or rights under other law such as title 17 of the U.S. Code.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The award of attorneys fees is independently authorized by this section with respect to a proceeding for a prejudgment relief brought because this section prohibits electronic self-help, and not subject to other rules regarding attorneys fees such as
                        rules that may require a contract term allowing such fees in order for a court to award them, or requiring qualification in equity in order to receive them. Here, the provision is intended to recognize that this Act’s ban on electronic
                        self-help is unique and disadvantageous to licensors in ways that are not reflected in other state laws. To the extent attorneys fees are available under other laws in other cases, this section does not disturb those laws.

                        As used in this section:“Base year” means either of the two calendar years immediately preceding a qualified business firm’s first year of grant eligibility, at the choice of the business firm.“Federal minimum wage” means the minimum wage standard as
                        currently defined by the United States Department of Labor in the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. Such definition applies to permanent full-time employees paid on an hourly or wage basis. For those permanent full-time
                        employees filling permanent full-time, salaried positions, the minimum wage is defined as the employee’s annual salary divided by 52 weeks per year divided by 35 hours per week.“Full month” means the number of days that a permanent
                        full-time position must be filled in order to count in the calculation of the job creation grant amount. A full month is calculated by dividing the total number of days in the calendar year by 12. A full month for the purpose of
                        calculating job creation grants is equivalent to 30.416666 days.“Grant eligible position” means a new permanent full-time position created above the threshold number at an eligible business firm. Positions in retail, personal service
                        or food and beverage service shall not be considered grant eligible positions.“Minimum wage” means the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum wage, whichever is higher. The Department shall determine whichever is higher for
                        the current calendar year as of December 1 of the prior calendar year, and its determination shall be continuously in effect throughout the calendar year, regardless of changes to the federal minimum wage or the Virginia minimum
                        wage during that year.“Permanent full-time position” means a job of indefinite duration at a business firm located within an enterprise zone requiring the employee to report for work within the enterprise zone; and requiring (i)
                        a minimum of 35 hours of an employee’s time per week for the entire normal year of the business firm’s operation, which “normal year” must consist of at least 48 weeks, (ii) a minimum of 35 hours of an employee’s time per week
                        for the portion of the calendar year in which the employee was initially hired for or transferred to the business firm, or (iii) a minimum of 1,680 hours per year. Such position shall not include (i) seasonal, temporary or contract
                        positions, (ii) a position created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to a business firm located within an enterprise zone, (iii) any position that previously existed in the Commonwealth,
                        or (iv) positions created by a business that is simultaneously closing facilities in other areas of the Commonwealth.“Qualified business firm” means a business firm designated as a qualified business firm by the Department pursuant
                        to § 59.1-542.“Report to work” means that the employee filling a permanent full-time position reports to the business’ zone establishment on a regular basis.“Subsequent base year” means the base year for calculating the number
                        of grant eligible positions in a second or subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant period. If a second or subsequent five-year grant period is requested within two years after the previous five-year grant period, the subsequent
                        base year will be the last grant year. The calculation of this subsequent base year employment will be determined by the number of permanent full-time positions in the preceding base year, plus the number of threshold positions,
                        plus the number of grant eligible positions in the final year of the previous grant period. If a business firm applies for subsequent five consecutive calendar year grant periods beyond the two years immediately following the completion
                        of the previous five-year grant period, the business firm shall use one of the two preceding calendar years as the subsequent base year, at the choice of the business firm.“Threshold number” means an increase of four permanent
                        full-time positions over the number of permanent full-time positions in the base year or subsequent base year.“Virginia minimum wage” means the applicable minimum wage as determined pursuant to the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§
