      <p>
       This section, when reasonably construed, only authorizes the notary to take an affidavit when it is required by the law to be taken before a justice. There does not appear to be any statutory authority for an affidavit of loss under a policy of automobile insurance to be taken either before a justice or a notary. Commonwealth v. Simon, 11 Va. L. Reg. 349 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority of the notary to administer an oath is purely statutory. In the absence of a statute the notary has no authority to take an affidavit. Commonwealth v. Simon, 11 Va. L. Reg. 349 (1925).

When an oath is taken by a judge, the record shall be in the first court in which he sits. When taken by an officer appointed by or belonging to a court, it shall be in the said court or in such other court as may be provided by law. In the case of a member or officer of either house of the General Assembly, the record shall be on the journal of the house in which he qualifies, or in such other manner as that house may prescribe by its rules. In the case of any other officer, unless it be otherwise provided, the record shall be in the court of the county or corporation in which the duties are to be discharged; or, if his duties are not to be discharged wholly in one county or corporation, then in the court of the county or corporation in which such officer resides.

     <p>
      The proper court, whenever, in its opinion, it may be necessary for the protection of the public interests, may order any officer, of whom a bond is required by law, to give a new bond, or a bond in addition to one already given, within such time, not less than ten nor more than thirty days, as the court may prescribe; but the officer shall be served with a copy of a summons or rule, at least ten days before the order is made, citing him to appear and show cause against the same. The summons or rule shall be awarded whenever the court deems it proper, or on application to the court by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or, if the application is to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, by the Attorney General. Such order shall be made by the circuit court of the county or city, if such officer is an officer of such county or city or any district thereof or by the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, if he is a clerk of either court. Any new bond or additional bond given before the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals shall be certified and transmitted to the clerk, to whom the original bond is required to be delivered, to be recorded by him. The bond may be given before the court requiring it or the judge thereof in vacation, or, if the court is the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, before either court or any three of the judges thereof in vacation; and when the bond is given in vacation, it shall be certified and returned by the judge or judges, before whom it is given, to the clerk of the proper court, who shall file and record the same in his office. If any officer fail or refuse to give the bond so required of him within the time prescribed, his office shall be deemed vacant.

     <p>
      Any company with a paid-up cash capital of not less than $250,000, incorporated and organized under the laws of any state of the United States or foreign country, for the purpose of transacting business as surety on obligations of persons or corporations, and which has complied with all the requirements of law regulating the admission of such companies to transact business in this Commonwealth, shall, upon production of evidence of solvency and credit satisfactory to the court or judge or other officer authorized to approve such bond, be accepted as surety upon the bond of any person or corporation required by the laws of this Commonwealth, or by any court, judge or other public officer or board or organization, to execute a bond with surety or sureties. If such surety company shall furnish satisfactory evidence of its ability to provide all the security required as aforesaid, no additional surety shall be exacted. Such surety shall be released from its liability on the same terms and conditions as are by law prescribed for the release of individuals, and shall have all the rights, remedies and reliefs of an individual guarantor, indemnitor or surety, and be subject to all the liabilities thereof.

       A surety on the bond of a county treasurer who had complied with the provisions of this section has the arbitrary right to be relieved from his suretyship, whether he became such surety for a valuable consideration or not. The surety is not required to show cause as a condition precedent to the relief sought, and the court has no discretion in the matter. If the trial court refuses relief the proper remedy is mandamus, and not a writ of error as the duty devolved upon the court is purely ministerial. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Peebles,

     <p>
      A surety, or his committee, or personal representative, in a bond, other than the bond of a commissioner or receiver, given under a decree or order of a court for the payment of money, if no suit be pending for the recovery thereof, may file his petition in the court which rendered or made the decree or order, or to which the case has been removed, for a bond of indemnity. The petition shall state that the petitioner has reason to believe that he, or the estate he represents, is likely to suffer pecuniary loss in consequence of such suretyship and the grounds of such belief and shall be verified by affidavit. Upon the filing of the petition and proof of reasonable notice to the principal in the bond and all the parties in interest, the court may require such indemnifying bond, with satisfactory sureties, to be given within a time to be prescribed. If such bond be given, it shall be with condition and shall bind the obligors therein to indemnify the sureties in the former bond against all loss or damage in consequence of such former bond. If such bond be not given, the court, on the request of such surety, personal representative or committee, if the money be due and payable, or whenever the same becomes due and payable, shall order suit to be brought for its recovery and prosecuted to judgment and by execution.

Executions, or other legal process to which the principal creditor was entitled, may be issued on any such judgment or decree in the name of the original creditor against the person primarily liable for the benefit of the person secondarily liable to the extent to which he has satisfied the original creditor.

       If a surety who has paid a debt, in whole or in part, wishes to subject the personal property of his principal by writ of fieri facias, he should proceed under this section which gives him the right to recover from the principal the amount he has paid with interest from the time of payment and five percent damages on said amount.

        Surety deemed assignee of creditor’s rights and remedies for collection of amount paid. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A surety or other party secondarily liable, upon payment of the debt of his principal, may be substituted to and become the owner of all of the rights and remedies of the creditor for the enforcement and collection of the amount or amounts so paid, and shall be deemed the assignee thereof. In re Worley, 251 F. Supp. 725, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6917 (W.D. Va. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equity will allow the surety upon payment of the debt of his principal to treat the original debt to the creditor as still subsisting and to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor for the repayment of any funds expended on behalf of the principal if the creditor possessed any special coign of advantage such as a deed of trust. These rights are not based upon the instrument evidencing the original obligation; however, they are merely additional remedies given to enforce the implied obligation of the person whose primary duty it was to pay the debt, as between the two obligors. Thus the surety or accommodation party is entitled to use these methods to collect whatever he has paid, and only that amount. In re Worley, 251 F. Supp. 725, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6917 (W.D.
