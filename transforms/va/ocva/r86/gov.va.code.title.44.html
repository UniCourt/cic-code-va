       “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in the Virginia National Guard. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Virginia General Assembly may or may not have the authority to mandate that the Virginia National Guard continue the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy after its recent repeal by Congress, but the federal regulations governing the repeal have not yet been issued. The United States Constitution expressly reserves to the states the power to appoint officers to the state militias, including the National Guard. The power to determine which state guard officers are eligible for service in the overlapping National Guard of the United States, however, rests with Congress. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bill Janis, Member, House of Delegates, 11-001, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (01/25/11).
     </p>
     <p>
      Congress, through the spending power, can condition the use of federal funds on the States’ acceptance of the federal repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Should the General Assembly wish to avoid the conditions likely to be attached to these funds with respect to “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and mandate that the policy continue in the Virginia National Guard, it can raise, equip and fund an independent Virginia militia entirely from state revenues. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bill Janis, Member, House of Delegates, 11-001, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (01/25/11).

      For the purpose of collecting any fines or penalties imposed by a court-martial, the military judge whenever one sits on such court, and otherwise the president of the court, or the summary court officer, shall, within fifteen days after the fines or penalties have been imposed and approved, make a list of all the persons fined, describing them distinctly, and showing the sums imposed as fines or penalties on each person, and shall draw his warrant, under his official signature, directed to any marshal of the court, or to the sheriff, sergeant, or any policeman of any city or county, as the case may be, thereby commanding him to levy such fines or penalties, together with the costs, on the goods and chattels of such delinquent, and the warrant shall thereupon have the force and effect of fieri facias, but such delinquent shall not be entitled to the benefit of any exemption law of this Commonwealth, as against such warrant and the lien thereof. In default of sufficient personal property to satisfy the same, the officer executing the same shall make report accordingly to the drawing authority of the warrant which may then require the fined person to show whether or not he possesses sufficient property to satisfy the fine and if such property is found to exist and the fined person fails to deliver it over the executing officer shall be ordered to take the body of the delinquent and convey him to the jail of the city or county in which he may be found, whose jailer shall closely confine him without bail until the fine or penalty and jailer’s fees be paid. No such imprisonment shall extend beyond the period of ten days.

       NATIONAL GUARD MUTUAL ASSISTANCE COMPACT
      </b>
      Article I. Purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purposes of this compact are to:

     <ol>
      <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol11">
       Provide for mutual aid among the party states in the utilization of the national guard to cope with emergencies.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol12">
       Permit and encourage a high degree of flexibility in the deployment of national guard forces in the interest of efficiency.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol13">
       Maximize the effectiveness of the national guard in those situations which call for its utilization under this compact.

      <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol14">
       Provide protection for the rights of national guard personnel when serving in other states on emergency duty.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol14a">
         This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.
        </li>
        <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol14b">
         Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.
        </li>
        <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol14c">

        </li>

         Whenever national guard forces of any party state are engaged in another state in carrying out the purposes of this compact, the members thereof so engaged shall have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as members of national guard forces in such other state. The requesting state shall save members of the national guard forces of responding states harmless from civil liability for acts or omissions in good faith which occur in the performance of their duty while engaged in carrying out the purposes of this compact, whether the responding forces are serving the requesting state within its borders or are in transit to or from such service.

        <li id="t44c01a4.1s44-54.1ol14g">
         Each party state shall provide, in the same amounts and manner as if they were on duty within their state, for the pay and allowances of the personnel of its national guard units while engaged without the state pursuant to this compact and while going to and returning from such duty pursuant to this compact. Such pay and allowances shall be deemed items of expense reimbursable under paragraph (f) by the requesting state.

         Each party state providing for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members and the representatives of deceased members of its national guard forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed within their own state, shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits in the same manner and on the same terms in case such members sustain injury or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact. Such compensation and death benefits shall be deemed items of expense reimbursable pursuant to paragraph (f) of this article.

If the office or position has been abolished or otherwise has ceased to exist during such leave of absence, they shall be reinstated in a position of like seniority, status and pay, if the position exists, or in a comparable vacant position for which they are qualified, unless to do so would be unreasonable.For the purposes of this section, with respect to employees of the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions who do not normally work approximately equal workdays on five or more days of each calendar week, the term “workday” shall mean 1/260 of the total working hours such employee would be scheduled to work during an entire federal fiscal year, not taking into account any state holidays, annual leave, military leave, or other absences. Where such employee returns from federally funded military duty and the eight-hour rest period required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (38 U.S.C. § 4301 et seq.) overlaps such employee’s scheduled work shift, the employee shall receive paid military leave to the extent of such overlap.

      When the Adjutant General shall receive information from the Governor of the disbandment of an organization of the National Guard occupying or using an armory provided by the Commonwealth under the direction of the Adjutant General, he shall determine whether such armory shall be sold or not, and if it is determined that such armory be sold after due publication as prescribed by the laws of the Commonwealth for the sale of real estate under a deed of trust, it shall be sold at public auction for the highest price to be paid for same, and upon such terms and conditions as may seem best to the Adjutant General.

        Executive order requiring face masks. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Winery was not entitled to a temporary injunction from enforcement of an executive order requiring face coverings to be worn by individuals in certain settings, because the Governor of Virginia and the Virginia State Health Commissioner validly enacted the order to limit the spread of COVID-19 and expressly waived the application of the criminal prohibition on the wearing of a mask to conceal one’s identity. The winery could not demonstrate a likely success as to the merits, irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest. Strother v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 233, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 106 (Fauquier County June 29, 2020).

      <p>
       Plaintiff’s motion for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to declare Executive Order No. 63 (EO 63), requiring face coverings in response to COVID-19, null and void was denied as EO 63 was appropriately issued because it addressed exceptional circumstances that existed concerning a communicable disease of public health threat that was issued by the State Health Commissioner; the law provided broad discretion and relied on the Governor’s judgment to determine how to resolve the emergency; the Governor’s Executive Orders were consistent with the state constitution; and plaintiff failed to establish that he was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.

        Applicability. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       By virtue of Va. Code Ann. Title 44 including limiting provisions, it is clear that § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t44c3.2s44-146.15" target="_self">44-146.15 </a></cite>(3) applies to the Governor of Virginia. To hold otherwise would render the provision entirely moot. However, the plain language of the statute also applies to any political subdivision, or any other governmental authority. Ergo, the plain language of the statute similarly makes clear that the Governor is not absolved of limitations by joining with another figure in the issuance of an executive order. Rather, the limiting language encompasses both the Governor and any joining entity. For this reason, § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t44c3.2s44-146.15" target="_self">44-146.15 </a></cite>(3) applies equally to the Governor and the Virginia State Health Commissioner. SEG Props., L.L.C. v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 216, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Loudoun County June 10, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion for temporary injunction was properly denied where the executive orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic prohibiting public access to indoor shooting ranges did not impermissibly infringe on the right to bear arms as protected by Va. Const., Art. I, § 13, and § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t44c3.2s44-146.15" target="_self">44-146.15 </a></cite>(3). SEG Props., L.L.C. v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 216, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Loudoun County June 10, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of the Virginia Constitution and the statutory protections afford the people the right to bear arms and such protection extends to the right to train therewith. That protection, however, does not extend to businesses such as indoor shooting ranges. SEG Props., L.L.C. v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 216, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Loudoun County June 10, 2020).

       Four declarations of a judicial emergency by the Virginia Supreme Court and orders suspending jury trials, combined with declarations of emergency by President Trump and Governor Northam, invoked the statute to toll defendant’s speedy trial during the natural disaster caused by the coronavirus; it rises to the level of a natural disaster as a communicable disease of a public health threat and the court could not appropriately protect the health and safety of trial participants if it conducted a jury trial during this judicial emergency and pandemic.

      The Governor shall be Director of Emergency Management. He shall take such action from time to time as is necessary for the adequate promotion and coordination of state and local emergency services activities relating to the safety and welfare of the Commonwealth in time of disasters.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governor shall have, in addition to his powers hereinafter or elsewhere prescribed by law, the following powers and duties:

      <li id="t44c3.2s44-146.17ol151">
       To proclaim and publish such rules and regulations and to issue such orders as may, in his judgment, be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter including, but not limited to such measures as are in his judgment required to control, restrict, allocate or regulate the use, sale, production and distribution of food, fuel, clothing and other commodities, materials, goods, services and resources under any state or federal emergency services programs.He may adopt and implement the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Operations Plan, which provides for state-level emergency operations in response to any type of disaster or large-scale emergency affecting Virginia and that provides the needed framework within which more detailed emergency plans and procedures can be developed and maintained by state agencies, local governments and other organizations.He may direct and compel evacuation of all or part of the populace from any stricken or threatened area if this action is deemed necessary for the preservation of life, implement emergency mitigation, preparedness, response or recovery actions; prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destination in connection with evacuation; and control ingress and egress at an emergency area, including the movement of persons within the area and the occupancy of premises therein.Executive orders, to include those declaring a state of emergency and directing evacuation, shall have the force and effect of law and the violation thereof shall be punishable as a civil penalty of not more than $500 or as a Class 1 misdemeanor in every case where the executive order declares that its violation shall have such force and effect. Where an executive order declares a violation shall be punishable as a civil penalty, such violation shall be charged by summons and may be executed by a law-enforcement officer when such violation is observed by the officer. The summons used by a law-enforcement officer pursuant to this section shall be, in form, the same as the uniform summons for motor vehicle law violations as prescribed pursuant to § 46.2-388. The proceeds of such civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid and collected only in lawful money of the United States and paid into the state treasury to the credit of the Literary Fund.Such executive orders declaring a state of emergency may address exceptional circumstances that exist relating to an order of quarantine or an order of isolation concerning a communicable disease of public health threat that is issued by the State Health Commissioner for an affected area of the Commonwealth pursuant to Article 3.02 (§ 32.1-48.05 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 32.1.Except as to emergency plans issued to prescribe actions to be taken in the event of disasters and emergencies, no rule, regulation, or order issued under this section shall have any effect beyond June 30 next following the next adjournment of the regular session of the General Assembly but the same or a similar rule, regulation, or order may thereafter be issued again if not contrary to law;

However, if federal funding is not available to establish and fund the program, the Governor shall, prior to making such purchases, receive a contract for payment for purchase from the private nongovernmental entities for the full cost of procuring and distributing the PPE, which shall include any amortized costs of administering the program. Any purchase made by the Governor pursuant to this subdivision shall be exempt from the provisions of the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.), except the Governor shall be encouraged to comply with the provisions of § 2.2-4310 when possible. The Governor shall also provide for competition where practicable and include a written statement regarding the basis for awarding any contract. Prior to implementing such a program, the Department of Emergency Management shall consult with and survey private, nongovernmental entities in order to assess demand for participation in the program as well as the quantity and types of personal protective equipment such entities would like to procure.As used in this subdivision, “personal protective equipment” or “PPE” means equipment or supplies worn or employed to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries and illnesses and may include items such as gloves, safety glasses and shoes, earplugs or muffs, hard hats, respirators, coveralls, vests, full body suits, hand sanitizer, plastic shields, or testing for the communicable disease of public health threat.

The Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Virginia Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund shall be the lead coordinating agencies for those individuals determined to be victims, and the plan shall also contain current contact information for both agencies. Such plan shall also contain provisions to ensure that the plan is applied equitably and that the needs of minority and vulnerable communities are met during emergencies. Every four years, each local and interjurisdictional agency shall conduct a comprehensive review and revision of its emergency operations plan to ensure that the plan remains current, and the revised plan shall be formally adopted by the locality’s governing body. In the case of an interjurisdictional agency, the plan shall be formally adopted by the governing body of each of the localities encompassed by the agency.

      If two or more political subdivisions find that disaster operation plans and programs would be better served by interjurisdictional arrangements in planning for, preventing, or responding to disaster in that area, then direct steps may be taken as necessary, including creation of an interjurisdictional relationship, a joint emergency operations plan, mutual aid, or such other activities as necessary for planning and services. Any political subdivision may provide or receive assistance in the event of a disaster or emergency, pursuant to this chapter, under the provisions of any local mutual aid agreement or by the Statewide Mutual Aid program if agreed to by resolution of the governing body. The action of the governing body may include terms and conditions deemed necessary by the governing body for participation in the program. The governing body may withdraw from participation in the Statewide Mutual Aid program by adoption of a resolution or ordinance upon a finding that participation is no longer in the public interest. The locality shall immediately notify the State Coordinator of Emergency Services of the adoption of a participation or withdrawal resolution.

       City properly imposed a curfew by executive order via its emergency powers because of the express grant of broad police powers to care for the health and safety of persons and property found in the Virginia Code. The simple omission of express authority to set a curfew did not preclude the city from instituting a curfew in times of emergency, and the city was within its authority to make a curfew violation a Class 1 misdemeanor.

      PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

       ARTICLE II.
      </b>
      GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
     </p>
     <p>
      On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

       As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:
   
    “Critical infrastructure”
   
   means real and personal property and equipment owned or used to provide public utility or communications services, including communications networks, electric generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, gas distribution systems, lines, poles, pipes, structures, towers, water and sewage pipelines and systems, and related support facilities, buildings, offices, and equipment.
   
    “Declared disaster or emergency”
   
   means a disaster or emergency as defined in § 44-146.16 for which a state of emergency as defined in § 44-146.16 has been declared for the Commonwealth by the Governor or by an official authorized by federal law to make such declarations.
   
    “Disaster-related or emergency-related work”
   
   means repairing, renovating, installing, building, or rendering services or other activities necessary to mitigate damage to critical infrastructure resulting from a declared disaster or emergency during the disaster response period. “Disaster-related or emergency-related work” does not include (i) any activities that an out-of-state business or an out-of-state employee is paid to perform by the Commonwealth, a locality in the Commonwealth, or a registered business in Virginia or (ii) the sale of goods by an out-of-state business or an out-of-state employee to the Commonwealth, a locality in the Commonwealth, or a registered business in the Commonwealth.
   
    “Disaster response period”
   
   means a period that begins 10 days prior to the first day of the declared disaster or emergency and extends for a period of 60 days after the end of the declared disaster or emergency, or any longer period as declared by the Governor.
   
    “Out-of-state business”
   
   means a business entity (i) whose services are requested by a registered business, the Commonwealth, or a local government for purposes of performing disaster-related or emergency-related work in the Commonwealth; (ii) that, except for declared disaster-related or emergency-related work, has no presence in and conducts no business in the Commonwealth; and (iii) that had not obtained from the State Corporation Commission a certificate of authority or registration to transact business in the Commonwealth and had no registrations or tax filings or nexus in the Commonwealth other than disaster-related or emergency-related work during the tax year immediately preceding the declared disaster or emergency. A business entity that otherwise meets the definition of an out-of-state business maintains that status even though it is affiliated with a registered business if such affiliation is solely through common ownership.
   
    “Out-of-state employee”
   
   means an employee who, except for disaster-related or emergency-related work during the disaster response period, does not work in the Commonwealth.
   
    “Registered business”
   
   means a domestic or foreign business entity that is listed in the business entity records maintained in the office of the clerk of the State Corporation Commission, provides public utility or communications services, and was in existence or had obtained from the State Corporation Commission a certificate of authority or registration to transact business in the Commonwealth prior to the declared disaster or emergency.
