       Editor’s note.
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its regular session of 1991, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a study of the laws governing elections in the Commonwealth. In January of 1993, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a
                    proposed revision of Title 24.1, Elections. This report, which was published as Senate Document No. 25 of the 1993 session, contains reviser’s notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion
                    here. The Commission’s draft of the revision of Title 24.1, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 641 of the Acts of 1993. Effective December 1, 1993, it repealed Title 24.1 and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 24.2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to its revision by c. 641, former Title 24.1 was amended by certain other acts passed at the 1993 session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated these amendments into new Title 24.2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the cases cited in the notes under sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 24.1 and earlier statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 2 provides: “That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section or chapter of Title 24.1 or any other title of the Code of Virginia as such titles existed prior to December 1, 1993, are transferred
                    in the same or modified form to a new section or chapter of Title 24.2 or any other title of the Code and whenever any such former section or chapter is given a new number in Title 24.2 or any other title, all references to any such
                    former section or chapter of Title 24.1 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents or portions thereof.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 3 provides: “That the rules and regulations of the State Board of Elections in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be
                    regulations promulgated under this act.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 4 provides: “That this recodification of Title 24.1 as Title 24.2 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, committee or other appointed body referred to in Title 24.2,
                    and each such officer and member shall continue to serve for the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 24.1.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 5 provides: “That this recodification of Title 24.1 as Title 24.2, including the repeal of § 24.1-90.2, shall not be construed to affect the term of office of any elected officeholder holding office on December 1, 1993.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 6 provides: “That the provisions of § 9-77.11 [now § 30-152] of the Code of Virginia shall apply to the codification of Title 24.2 so as to give effect to other laws enacted at the 1993 Session of the General Assembly notwithstanding
                    the delay in the effective date of this act.”

                    Candidate was properly registered to vote in a new district where the candidate’s new residence was located and was properly placed on the ballot for that district because the candidate showed that the candidate’s domicile was changed to the new address,
                    even if the candidate’s spouse continued to reside at the old address, in that the candidate left the old residence intending to abandon that home as the candidate’s domicile, the candidate had not spent a night at the old residence
                    after moving, the neighbors at the old residence had not seen the candidate after the move except on one occasion at a block party, and the records of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles reflected a change in the candidate’s
                    address. In addition the candidate’s new residence was furnished with care, the candidate’s personal memorabilia were kept in the new residence, the candidate’s annual family celebrations were held at the new residence, and the candidate
                    maintained an office at the new residence. Dixon v. Va. State Bd. of Elections, 83 Va. Cir. 371, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 218 (Loudoun County Sept. 16, 2011).

                        Although board members swore an oath to uphold the law and constitution, evidence of their training, or lack thereof, was relevant to their defense for removal; thus, the circuit court erred by excluding any reference to Virginia State Board of Elections’

                    Each electoral board shall meet in the month of May or June in 2007, and every four years thereafter, and shall appoint a general registrar, who shall be a qualified voter of the county or city for which he is appointed unless such county or city has
                    a population of 50,000 or less. In the case of a city that is wholly contained within one county, the city electoral board may appoint a qualified voter of that county to serve as city general registrar. General registrars shall serve
                    four-year terms beginning July 1, 2007, and each fourth year thereafter, and continue in office until a successor is appointed and qualifies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The electoral board shall fill any vacancy in the office of general registrar for the unexpired term. The electoral board shall declare vacant and fill the office of the general registrar if the appointee fails to qualify and deliver a copy of his oath
                    to the secretary of the electoral board within 30 days after he has been notified of his appointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No general registrar shall hold any other office, by election or appointment, while serving as general registrar; however, with the consent of the electoral board, he may undertake other duties which do not conflict with his duties as general registrar.
                    General registrars shall not serve as officers of election. The election or appointment of a general registrar to any other office shall vacate the office of the general registrar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No general registrar shall be eligible to offer for or hold an office to be filled by election in whole or in part by the qualified voters of his jurisdiction at any election held during the time he serves as general registrar or for the six months thereafter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The electoral board shall not appoint to the office of general registrar any person who is the spouse of an electoral board member or any person, or the spouse of any person, who is the parent, grandparent, sibling, child, or grandchild of an electoral
                    board member.

                    No general registrar shall serve as the chairman of a political party or other officer of a state, local or district level political party committee. No general registrar shall serve as a paid or volunteer worker in the campaign of a candidate for nomination
                    or election to an office filled by election in whole or in part by the qualified voters of his jurisdiction. The restrictions of this paragraph shall apply to paid assistant registrars but shall not apply to unpaid assistant registrars.

                <p>
                    The electoral board of each county and city shall determine the number of assistant registrars to serve in the office of the general registrar, including any to serve full-time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Russell County, there shall be at least one full-time assistant registrar who shall serve in the office of the general registrar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any county or city whose population is over 15,500, there shall be at least one assistant registrar who shall serve at least one day each week in the office of the general registrar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any county or city whose population is 15,500 or less shall have at least one substitute registrar who is able to take over the duties of the general registrar in an emergency and who shall assist the general registrar when he requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The electoral board shall set the term for the assistant registrars; however, their terms shall not extend beyond the term set by law of the incumbent general registrar. The general registrar shall establish the duties of assistant registrars, appoint
                    assistant registrars, and have authority to remove any assistant registrar who fails to discharge the duties of his office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All assistant registrars shall have the same limitations and qualifications and fulfill the same requirements as the general registrar except that (i) an assistant registrar may be an officer of election and (ii) an assistant registrar shall be a qualified
                    voter of the Commonwealth but is not required to be a qualified voter of the county or city in which he serves as registrar. Candidates who are residents in the county or city for which they seek appointment may be given preference
                    in hiring. Localities may mutually agree to share an assistant registrar among two or more localities. Assistant registrars who agree to serve without pay shall be supervised and trained by the general registrar.

                <p>
                    All other employees shall be employed by the general registrar. The general registrar may hire additional temporary employees on a part-time basis as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The compensation of any assistant registrar, other than those who agree to serve without pay, or any other employee of the general registrar shall be fixed and paid by the local governing body and shall be the equivalent of or exceed the minimum hourly
                    wage established by federal law in 29 U.S.C. § 206 (a)(1), as amended.

                    The general registrar shall not appoint to the office of paid assistant registrar his spouse or any person, or the spouse of any person, who is his parent, grandparent, sibling, child, or grandchild.

                    Each electoral board at its regular meeting in the first week of February of the year in which the terms of officers of election are scheduled to expire shall appoint officers of election. Their terms of office shall begin on March 1 following their appointment
                    and continue, at the discretion of the electoral board, for a term not to exceed three years or until their successors are appointed. The general registrar shall prepare and submit to the electoral board a plan to ensure that adequate
                    numbers of trained officers of election are available to serve in each election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not less than three competent citizens shall be appointed for each precinct. However, a precinct having more than 4,000 registered voters shall have not less than five officers of election serving for a presidential election, and the electoral board shall
                    appoint additional officers as needed to satisfy this requirement. Insofar as practicable, each officer shall be a qualified voter of the precinct he is appointed to serve, but in any case a qualified voter of the Commonwealth. In
                    appointing the officers of election, representation shall be given to each of the two political parties having the highest and next highest number of votes in the Commonwealth for Governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election.
                    The representation of the two parties shall be equal at each precinct having an even number of officers and shall vary by no more than one at each precinct having an odd number of officers. If practicable, officers shall be appointed
                    from lists of nominations filed by the political parties entitled to appointments. The party shall file its nominations with the secretary of the electoral board at least 10 days before February 1 each year. The electoral board may
                    appoint additional citizens who do not represent any political party to serve as officers. If practicable, no more than one-third of the total number of officers appointed for each precinct may be citizens who do not represent any
                    political party.

                    persons representing the political party holding the primary shall serve as the officers of election if possible.

                <p>
                    The electoral board shall ensure that one officer is designated as the chief officer of election and one officer is designated as the assistant for each precinct. The officer designated as the assistant for a precinct, whenever practicable, shall not
                    represent the same political party as the chief officer for the precinct. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where representatives for one or both of the two political parties having the largest number of votes for
                    Governor in the last preceding gubernatorial election are unavailable, citizens who do not represent either of those two political parties may be designated as the chief officer and the assistant chief officer. In such case, the general
                    registrar shall provide notice to representatives of both parties at least 10 days prior to the election that he intends to use nonaffiliated officers so that each party shall have the opportunity to provide additional nominations.
                    The electoral board may also appoint at least one officer of election who reports to the precinct at least one hour prior to the closing of the precinct and whose primary responsibility is to assist with closing the precinct and reporting
                    the results of the votes at the precinct.

                <p>
                    The electoral board shall ensure that each chief officer and assistant is instructed in his duties not less than three nor more than 30 days before each election. Each officer of election may be instructed in his duties at an appropriate time or times
                    before each November general election, and training of the officers of election shall be conducted as provided by §

                <p>
                    When a vacancy occurs in the membership of the General Assembly during the recess of the General Assembly or when a member-elect to the next General Assembly dies, resigns, or becomes legally incapacitated to hold office prior to its meeting, the Governor
                    shall issue a writ of election to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs during the session of the General Assembly, the Speaker of the House of Delegates or the President pro tempore of the Senate, as the case may be, shall issue
                    the writ unless the respective house by rule or resolution shall provide otherwise. Upon receipt of written notification by a member or member-elect of his resignation as of a stated date, the Governor, Speaker, or President Pro Tempore,
                    as the case may be, may immediately issue the writ to call the election. The member’s or member-elect’s resignation shall not be revocable after the date stated by him for his resignation or after the forty-fifth day before the date
                    set for the special election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The writ shall be directed to the secretaries of the electoral boards and the general registrars of the respective counties and cities composing the district for which the election is to be held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no election to fill a vacancy shall be ordered or held if the general or special election at which it is to be called is scheduled within 75 days of the end of the term of the office to be filled.

                        The due process clause does not embrace the federal concept of the separation of powers so as to render unconstitutional the Virginia statutes that authorize circuit judges to fill vacancies on boards of supervisors. Avens v. Wright, 320 F. Supp. 677,

                        There is no federal constitutional wrong solely because the General Assembly, in exercising its authority to prescribe the manner for filling vacancies in public office, has delegated the responsibility for selecting interim officers to the state courts.

                    <p>
                        Acting under the grant of § 56 of the Virginia Constitution of 1902, the legislature empowered circuit judges to fill vacancies on boards of supervisors, regardless of the cause of the vacancy, and it specifically provided that this power could be exercised
                        even though the vacancy was created by the court’s own order in redistricting a county. This delegation of the appointive power to judges did not conflict with the doctrine of separation of powers found in §§ 5 and 39 of the Constitution
                        of 1902. Avens v. Wright, 320 F. Supp. 677, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9732 (W.D. Va. 1970).

                    <p>
                        There is little merit to the claim that county residents are denied equal protection because city and town councils are authorized by statutes to fill their own vacancies; even former § 15.1-808 provides for judicial appointment of interim councilmen
                        if the vacancies constitute a majority of council. Municipal and county governments have mutually exclusive jurisdictions, and though boards of supervisors and councils are, generally speaking, both legislative bodies, their origin,
                        function, and powers differ greatly. Avens v. Wright, 320 F. Supp. 677, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9732 (W.D. Va. 1970).

                    <p>
                        All citizens in the county are treated in much the same manner, where neither the supervisors whom the circuit judges retained nor the supervisors appointed to represent new districts after rearrangement serve constituencies identical with the old. Avens

                        The vacancy referred to in former § 24.1-76 is a vacancy occurring during the term of an office, by death, resignation, removal and the like, and not a failure to appoint a successor to an incumbent who is to hold until his successor is appointed and
                        has qualified. In the latter case there can be no vacancy. Chadduck v. Burke,

                        A special election to be held on November 6, 2001, to fill a vacated position on a county board of supervisors was required to be conducted based on the election districts existing at the time of the election; thus, if the decennial redistricting had
                        occurred and was precleared by the United States Department of Justice, the election would be required to be conducted based on the new district that most closely approximated the old district from which the supervisor originally
                        was elected to the board of supervisors. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Melanie L. Rapp and The Honorable Harvey B. Morgan, Members, House of Delegates, 01-016 (4/18/01).

                        Because removal of public officials proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature due to the high penalty they impose on a removed official, the correct burden of proof is clear and convincing evidence, and the General Assembly has taken no action to specifically

                        In this removal action, board members belonged to one political party while the third board member was from the opposite political party, but this was insufficient to display bias because all local electoral boards were so comprised; political party affiliation
                        had no bearing on whether the board members violated their oaths of office. Townes v. Va. State Bd. of Elections,

                        Petition for removal alleged numerous Virginia Freedom of Information Act violations claiming that the board members repeatedly failed to follow open meeting requirements; the petition and attached exhibits gave the members sufficient notice of the scope
                        of the violations and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the presentation of evidence showing the lack of meeting agendas and minutes in addition to the meetings which were held without proper notice.

                        Defendant was entitled to attorney fees and costs explicitly provided that no one who signed a petition for the removal of an official shall be liable for costs, an award of reasonable attorney fees was appropriate since the petition at issue was not
                        under oath, the services were valuable to the client as he no longer had a petition for removal against him, no expert testimony was offered, the hourly rates involved were those generally charged for similar services for lawyers

                    A petition for the removal of an officer shall state with reasonable accuracy and detail the grounds or reasons for removal and shall be signed by the person or persons making it under penalties of perjury. The circuit court shall not dismiss the petition
                    solely because of an error or omission in the form of the petition relating to its statement of the grounds or reasons for removal if such error or omission is not material in determining whether the statement of the grounds or reasons

                    As soon as the petition is filed with the court, the court shall issue a rule requiring the officer to show cause why he should not be removed from office, the rule alleging in general terms the cause or causes for such removal. The rule shall be returnable
                    in not less than five nor more than ten days and shall be served upon the officer with a copy of the petition. Upon return of the rule duly executed, unless good cause is shown for a continuance or postponement to a later day in the
                    term, the case shall be tried on the day named in the rule and take precedence over all other cases on the docket. If upon trial it is determined that the officer is subject to removal under the provisions of §

                            is not a private or personal action — is not purely private or civil — but is one which is primarily public in its nature, and which, although not a criminal case, is highly penal, and one in which the Commonwealth is a party.

                            In a proceeding under former § 24.1-79.7 to remove a commissioner of the revenue, the verdict of the jury acquitted the accused upon all of the charges against him. Upon the law applicable to the uncontroverted evidence, the accused had committed, during
                            his current term of office, one of the offenses specified in this section, under which the proceeding was had. It was held that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence and therefore was properly set aside by the
                            trial court. Warren v. Commonwealth,

                            In a proceeding under former § 24.1-79.7, to remove a commissioner of the revenue, one of the charges was that the commissioner had knowingly and wilfully neglected to perform his duties by failing to assess persons with the necessary license taxes. Under
                            the evidence the jury was warranted in finding that the accused did not act corruptly or with evil intent, but honestly and with reasonable diligence, in the matters embraced in this charge. It was held that a verdict of the
                            jury in favor of the accused could not be set aside as to such charge. Warren v. Commonwealth,

                            Where in a proceeding for removal of a sheriff the petition for his removal failed to state that the offenses charged against the sheriff occurred during his present term of office as sheriff, the error was cured where the court permitted the filing of

                            In a proceeding against a sheriff for his removal from office the petition charged that the sheriff “wilfully, tacitly, neglected” to enforce the prohibition law. Defendant objected that this specification charged the sheriff with a “vague dereliction
                            of duty not covered by the statute,” because it contained the word “tacitly.” It was held that the word “tacitly” did not enlarge the scope of the offense charged. It simply described the manner in which the sheriff neglected
                            and refused to enforce the law, and might be treated as surplusage. Barbee v. Murphy,

                    Defendant was entitled to attorney fees and costs explicitly provided that no one who signed a petition for the removal of an official shall be liable for costs, an award of reasonable attorney fees was appropriate since the petition at issue was not
                    under oath, the services were valuable to the client as he no longer had a petition for removal against him, no expert testimony was offered, the hourly rates involved were those generally charged for similar services for lawyers and
                    paralegals of the experience of those involved, but the number of hours charged was not consistent with those generally charged for similar services. Commonwealth v. Orndorff, 104 Va. Cir. 94, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 64 (Shenandoah County

                        Third Congressional District was unconstitutionally drawn under strict scrutiny since the redistricting plan was predominantly based on race, significantly increased the total number of black voters in a historically safe majority-minority district, and
                        used a black voting-age population threshold for majority-minority districts, and thus the plan was not narrowly tailored to advance the compelling state interest of compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Page v. Va. State Bd.

                        Circuit court properly denied challengers’ request to declare that legislative districts violated the constitution because evidence was presented that would lead reasonable and objective people to differ regarding the compactness of the districts; the
                        evidence the presented by the challengers and the Virginia State Board of Elections and the House of Delegates was sufficient to establish that the constitutional validity of the districts under the compactness requirement was
                        fairly debatable. Vesilind v. Va. State Bd. of Elections,

                        If a challenger to a legislative redistricting plan, on the basis of race, meets its evidentiary burden, the electoral district in issue is subjected to strict scrutiny review, rather than a rational basis test, because the legislative action was taken
                        on the basis of race, a suspect category, and, under the strict scrutiny standard, the defendant must show that the district’s design was the result of a compelling governmental purpose and was narrowly tailored to achieve that
                        purpose. Wilkins v. West,

                        Issue of narrow tailoring of a voting district in a manner reasonably necessary to comply with federal requirements of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 1971 through 1974(e), is part of the strict scrutiny test, a test not applicable until after a
                        determination is first made that race was the predominant factor in drawing the district. Wilkins v. West,

                        Party asserting that a legislative redistricting plan has improperly used race as a criterion must show that the legislature subordinated traditional redistricting principles to racial considerations and that race was not merely a factor in the design
                        of the district, but was the predominant factor. Wilkins v. West,

                        In a challenge to a legislative redistricting plan on racial grounds, where majority-minority districts are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must
                        show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional redistricting principles, and that party must show that those redistricting
                        alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Wilkins v. West,

        Fifth, sixth and seventh districts combined in one multimember district by federal court. —

                        In the establishment of the fifth, sixth and seventh districts under former § 24.1-14.1, all naval personnel “homeported” at the U.S. Naval Station, Norfolk, about 36,700 persons, were assigned to the fifth district because that is where they were counted
                        on official census tracts. It was undisputed that only about 8,100 of such personnel lived aboard vessels, and there was evidence that about 18,000 lived outside the fifth district but within the Norfolk and Virginia Beach areas.
                        The federal district court, in Mahan v. Howell, 330 F. Supp. 1138 (E.D. Va. 1971), justifiably found that this legislative plan resulted in both significant population disparities and the assignment of military personnel to districts
                        in which they admittedly did not reside. Since discriminatory treatment of military personnel in legislative reapportionment is constitutionally impermissible, the district court did not abuse its discretion in prescribing an interim
                        plan of combining the fifth, sixth and seventh districts into one multimember district. Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 93 S. Ct. 979, 35 L. Ed. 2d 320, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 108, amended, 411 U.S. 922, 93 S. Ct. 1475, 36 L. Ed. 2d 316,

                        If a challenger to a legislative redistricting plan, on the basis of race, meets its evidentiary burden, the electoral district in issue is subjected to strict scrutiny review, rather than a rational basis test, because the legislative action was taken
                        on the basis of race, a suspect category, and, under the strict scrutiny standard, the defendant must show that the district’s design was the result of a compelling governmental purpose and was narrowly tailored to achieve that
                        purpose. Wilkins v. West,

                        Party asserting that a legislative redistricting plan has improperly used race as a criterion must show that the legislature subordinated traditional redistricting principles to racial considerations and that race was not merely a factor in the design

                        In a challenge to a legislative redistricting plan on racial grounds, where majority-minority districts are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must
                        show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional redistricting principles, and that party must show that those redistricting
                        alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance. Wilkins v. West,

                        Circuit court properly denied challengers’ request to declare that legislative districts violated the constitution because evidence was presented that would lead reasonable and objective people to differ regarding the compactness of the districts; the

                <p>
                    The governing body of each county and city shall establish by ordinance as many precincts as it deems necessary. Each governing body is authorized to increase or decrease the number of precincts and alter precinct boundaries subject to the requirements
                    of this chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time any precinct is established, it shall have no more than 5,000 registered voters. The general registrar shall notify the governing body whenever the number of voters who voted in a precinct in an election for President of the United States
                    exceeds 4,000. Within six months of receiving the notice, the governing body shall proceed to revise the precinct boundaries, and any newly established or redrawn precinct shall have no more than 5,000 registered voters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time any precinct is established, each precinct in a county shall have no fewer than 100 registered voters and each precinct in a city shall have no fewer than 500 registered voters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each precinct shall be wholly contained within a single congressional district, Senate district, House of Delegates district, and election district used for the election of one or more members of the governing body or school board for the county or city.
                    In each year ending in one, the governing body of each county and city shall establish the precinct boundaries to be consistent with any congressional district, Senate district, House of Delegates district, and local election district
                    that was adopted by the appropriate authority by June 15 of that year. If congressional districts, Senate districts, House of Delegates districts, or local election districts have not been adopted by the appropriate authority by June
                    15 of a year ending in one, the governing body may use the congressional districts, Senate districts, House of Delegates districts, or local election districts as such districts existed on June 15 of that year as the basis for establishing
                    the precinct boundaries to be used for the elections to be held in November of that year. Such governing body shall establish precinct boundaries to be consistent with any subsequent changes to the congressional districts, Senate districts,
                    House of Delegates districts, or local election districts. If a governing body is unable to establish a precinct with the minimum number of registered voters without splitting the precinct between two or more congressional districts,
                    Senate districts, House of Delegates districts, or local election districts, it shall apply to the State Board for a waiver to administer a split precinct. The State Board may grant the waiver or direct the governing body to establish

                        Since the legislature has seen fit to make the central voters’ list available to some advocates of political causes and candidates, it may not, within the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, deny it to others.

                    Acts 1993, c. 144 amended former § 24.1-23, from which this section is derived. Pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 1993, c. 641, cl. 6, effect has been given in this section, as set out above. In accordance with c. 144, the amendment added the second paragraph.

                    Although no law requires the acceptance of mailed voter registration applications with electronic signatures, the State Board of Elections is not precluded from directing that general registrars accept such applications, and the State Board, in its discretion,
                    may do so. The State Board also has discretionary authority to establish criteria to preserve the security of confidential voter information and to ensure the authenticity and validity of electronic signatures. See opinion of Attorney
                    General to Messrs. James M. Hinshaw, Daniel H. Haworth, W. Donald Brown, City of Norfolk Electoral Board, 13-111, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 47 (9/26/14).

                        Although individual presented evidence that he owned a house in Springfield, the evidence was unrefuted that he leased the property to others and did not dwell there. The fact that he listed the Springfield address on his motor vehicle operator’s license,
                        paid personal property tax on his automobile to Fairfax County, and was seeking employment in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, did not alter the conclusion that he was not a domiciliary of Fairfax County, because he did
                        not live in that locality with the intent to remain there for an unlimited time. Further, he did not have a place of abode in Fairfax County. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the registrar properly cancelled his
                        voter registration. Sachs v. Horan,

                        When a general registrar knows that an absentee voter has died prior to election day, but after having voted by absentee ballot, the registrar must cancel that voter’s registration, and the absentee ballot should not be counted; but when absentee ballots
                        are cast prior to election day in a manner by which the absentee ballot no longer can be set aside, the general registrar who knows of the voter’s death shall cancel that voter’s registration, but election officials are not otherwise
                        required to perform the impossible task of not counting the deceased voter’s absentee ballot. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Robin R. Lind, Secretary, Goochland County Electoral Board, 10-104, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 71 (10/26/10).

                        Although individual presented evidence that he owned a house in Springfield, the evidence was unrefuted that he leased the property to others and did not dwell there. The fact that he listed the Springfield address on his motor vehicle operator’s license,
                        paid personal property tax on his automobile to Fairfax County, and was seeking employment in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, did not alter the conclusion that he was not a domiciliary of Fairfax county, because he did
                        not live in that locality with the intent to remain there for an unlimited time. Further, he did not have a place of abode in Fairfax County. Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that the registrar properly cancelled his

                        There is nothing in former §§ 24.1-63 through 24.1-66 to sustain the contention that applications for registration shall at all times be open to public inspection, not by express direction, but by implication of the statutes. The fact that the legislature,
                        in the enactment of these sections, has provided a way by which the voters can have the applications for registration brought into court for inspection whenever necessary for the protection of the public interest, negatives the

                        after moving, the neighbors at the old residence had not seen the candidate after the move except on one occasion at a block party, and the records of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles reflected a change in the candidate’s
                        address. In addition the candidate’s new residence was furnished with care, the candidate’s personal memorabilia were kept in the new residence, the candidate’s annual family celebrations were held at the new residence, and the

                        The Constitution does not protect candidates from their own carelessness, where they forget to timely file their financial disclosure statement, since this section places an insignificant burden on candidacy that is unlikely to pose any serious barrier
                        to reasonably diligent candidates, and therefore does not appreciably restrict voters’ choices, and at the same time it promotes an informed electorate without the potential for corruption inherent in the old statute, and therefore

                        The requirement that a congressional candidate submit 400 signatures per congressional district before appearing on the ballot is constitutional because it has a rational relationship to legitimate state interests in regulating ballot access. Wood v.
                        Quinn, 104 F. Supp. 2d 611, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10233 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 230 F.3d 1356, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 31021 (4th Cir. 2000).

                        The provision in this section requiring 1000 qualified voter signatures in order for a candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives to have his name placed on the ballot is constitutional in that it does not impose a severe burden
                        or make it virtually impossible for a potential candidate to run for office. Amarasinghe v. Quinn, 148 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8140 (E.D. Va. 2001).

                        The signature requirement of collecting 1000 qualified voter signatures in order for a candidate to appear on the ballot for House of Representatives bears a rational relationship to Virginia’s legitimate interests in protecting the electoral process
                        from an undue burden posed by frivolous candidates and insincere ballot cluttering. Amarasinghe v. Quinn, 148 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8140 (E.D. Va. 2001).

                        A Democratic committee passed a resolution pursuant to former § 24.1-172, declaring that a primary should be held at a certain time. Less than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the primary the committee rescinded its action calling the primary. It was
                        held that the powers of the committee are prescribed and limited by law, and the committee had no legal authority for passing the rescinding resolution. At that date the rights of the Democratic voters to choose the candidates
                        of the party had already attached, and the rights of the candidates had also then become fully vested. Chichester v. Reamy,

                        preferences was not a compelling state interest; and (4) encouraging voter participation did not justify the burden that the open primary law placed on the right of association. Miller v. Brown, 503 F.3d 360, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS

                        Language of the Republican Party’s Plan of Organization (Plan) was clear and unambiguous: the Plan delegated to the Committee the authority to determine the nomination method unless Virginia law otherwise limited that authority, and where Virginia law
                        set forth an alternative method of nomination, the Plan did not give the Committee the authority to supersede or challenge that determination; the party officials had no complaint that the party’s right to govern itself had been
                        substantially burdened by the Incumbent Protection Act because the source of the complaint was the party’s own decision. 24th Senatorial Dist. Republican Comm. v. Alcorn, 820 F.3d 624, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 7028 (4th Cir. 2016).

                    Committee of a political party was entitled — due to the COVID-19 health crisis — to a temporary injunction enjoining the Virginia Department of Elections and the Virginia State Board of Elections from enforcing statutory provisions against the committee
                    so that the political party could then select its candidate for a Congressional district because the committee was likely to prevail on the merits and the harm of the party’s candidate not appearing on the general election ballot was

                    Candidate was properly registered to vote in a new district where the candidate’s new residence was located and was properly placed on the ballot for that district because the candidate showed that the candidate’s domicile was changed to the new address,

                    after moving, the neighbors at the old residence had not seen the candidate after the move except on one occasion at a block party, and the records of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles reflected a change in the candidate’s
                    address. In addition the candidate’s new residence was furnished with care, the candidate’s personal memorabilia were kept in the new residence, the candidate’s annual family celebrations were held at the new residence, and the candidate

                        This section failed constitutional analysis under strict scrutiny where the Commonwealth articulated no precise interest supporting the application of the regulation, thus there was nothing to weigh against the character and magnitude of the asserted
                        injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Even if the interests were the just and fair administration of primary elections or providing equal access to all citizens, the regulation was not narrowly

                        of Elections failed to demonstrate that the burden on the right of association was justified by a compelling state interest. Virginia did not have a compelling interest in preserving open primaries because: (1) subsection A of

                        Since plaintiffs who brought suit against the defendants personally and as members of the Virginia Board of Elections, alleging that their actions in enforcing Virginia’s Open Primary Law violated their First Amendment rights, were unable to demonstrate
                        that their alleged injury could be redressed by the declaration that the Open Primary Law was unconstitutional, and the Virginia Republican Party voluntarily elected an “open” primary, which it was legally entitled to do, there
                        was nothing the federal circuit court could do to prevent the party from “forcing” its members to vote with non-Republicans. Therefore, plaintiffs lacked standing to bring this suit. Marshall v. Meadows, 921 F. Supp. 1490, 1996

                        The requirement under former § 24.1-159 that “the signatures . . . shall be witnessed by a qualified voter of the same congressional district (as the person signing the petition)” is constitutional. This requirement obviously gives some assurance that
                        names appearing on the petition are genuine, not spurious. The witness takes oath to that fact and experience has shown that many people take their oaths seriously. Thus the requirement is a practical means of reinforcing compliance
                        with the statute. Libertarian Party v. Davis, 591 F. Supp. 1561, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23839 (E.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 766 F.2d 865, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 20401 (4th Cir. 1985) (decided under prior law).

                        which is a criminal violation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Marcus B. Simon, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 20-046, (9/24/20).

                    Immediately after the expiration of the time provided by law for a candidate for any office to qualify to have his name printed on the official ballot and prior to printing the ballots for an election, each general registrar shall forward to the Department
                    of Elections a list of the county, city, or town offices to be filled at the election and the names of all candidates who have filed for each office. In addition, each general registrar shall forward the name of any candidate who failed
                    to qualify with the reason for his disqualification. On that same day, the general registrar shall also provide a copy of the notice to each disqualified candidate. The notice shall be sent by email or regular mail to the address on
                    the candidate’s certificate of candidate qualification, and such notice shall be deemed sufficient. The Department of Elections shall promptly advise the general registrar of the accuracy of the list. The failure of any general registrar
                    to send the list to the Department of Elections for verification shall not invalidate any election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each general registrar shall have printed the number of ballots he determines will be sufficient to conduct the election. Such determination shall be based on the number of active registered voters and historical election data, including voter turnout,
                    and shall be subject to the approval by the electoral board.

                    The general registrar shall send to the Department of Elections a statement of the number of ballots ordered to be printed, proofs of each printed ballot for verification, and copies of each final ballot. If the Department of Elections finds that, in
                    its opinion, the number of ballots ordered to be printed by any general registrar is not sufficient, it may direct the general registrar to order the printing of a reasonable number of additional ballots.

                        The legal requirement for officers of election to assist voters with curbside voting is triggered upon the voter making a request for such service, by: (i) entering the polling place to alert the officers of election; (ii) sending another person inside
                        the polling place to alert the officers of election; or (iii) communicating with election officials in advance of coming to the polling place. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. G. William Thomas, Secretary, Electoral Board

                    Each representative shall be a qualified voter of any jurisdiction in the Commonwealth and shall present to the officers of election a written statement certifying that he is an authorized representative, signed by his party chairman for the jurisdiction
                    in which the election is held, the independent candidate, or the candidate in a primary, as appropriate. If the party chairman for the jurisdiction in which the election is held is unavailable to sign such a written designation, such

                    the jurisdiction in which the election is held. Such representatives shall be entitled to be present while the votes are counted and shall remain until the returns are completed.

                <p>
                    In case such representatives, or any of them, do not request to be present, the officers shall notify the bystanders, if any, and select one or more to be present with any available representatives of the parties or candidates so that there are as many

                    If a printed ballot is found to have been voted for a greater number of names for any one office than the number of persons required to fill the office, or if the title of the office is erased, the ballot shall be considered void as to all the names designated
                    to fill such office, but no further, and the ballot shall be counted for the other offices on the ballot. In the case of a ballot scanner machine, an election official is authorized to cause the ballot scanner to receive the ballot
                    and count it in accordance with this section. No ballot shall be void for having been voted for fewer names than authorized.

                    person shall be void and not counted.

                    law in conflict with this section, except requirements set out in charter provisions to govern the exercise of recall, initiative, or referendum powers in a county, city, or town.

                        Prior to circulating any petition for signature, an individual shall file a copy of the petition with the clerk of the circuit court for the county or city in which the referendum will be held. The individual shall be a qualified voter of the county or
                        city and shall file, with the petition copy, a statement giving his name; residence address and, if different, his mailing address; and the name of the organization, if any, which he represents in circulating the petition. The
                        copy of the petition shall be filed on or after the effective date of the law which authorizes the referendum for which the petition will be circulated. The clerk shall certify, within 10 days of such filing, that he has received

                        City’s effective rezoning ordinances concerning a historically significant property were subject to a petition for referendum filed by a citizens’ committee seeking to repeal the ordinances because a successful repeal of the ordinances neither amounted
                        to nor resulted in a rezoning of the property; instead, a successful repeal merely reverted the property back to its previously zoned state. Comm. of the Petitioners ex rel. Taylor v. City of Norfolk, 90 Va. Cir. 18, 2015 Va. Cir.

                        City’s certification, pursuant to the city charter, of effective rezoning ordinances concerning a historically significant property did not exempt the ordinances from referendum because the ordinances gave no “means of support” to protect the city from
                        imminent loss; rather, the ordinances merely gave a private developer the opportunity to restore the property. Comm. of the Petitioners ex rel. Taylor v. City of Norfolk, 90 Va. Cir. 18, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 11 (Norfolk Feb. 6,

                        Former Article 7 of Chapter 7 of Title 24.1 was carefully drawn for the purpose of preserving the secrecy of the ballot, for the identification of the voter, for publicity as to the actual voting on the day of election, and for the prevention of fraud.
                        The article was based upon sound public policy, and its constitutionality should be upheld unless it clearly contravenes some inhibition to be found in the Constitution. Moore v. Pullem,

                        When a general registrar knows that an absentee voter has died prior to election day, but after having voted by absentee ballot, the registrar must cancel that voter’s registration, and the absentee ballot should not be counted; but when absentee ballots
                        are cast prior to election day in a manner by which the absentee ballot no longer can be set aside, the general registrar who knows of the voter’s death shall cancel that voter’s registration, but election officials are not otherwise
                        required to perform the impossible task of not counting the deceased voter’s absentee ballot. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Robin R. Lind, Secretary, Goochland County Electoral Board, 10-104, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 71 (10/26/10).

                <p>
                    When a general registrar knows that an absentee voter has died prior to election day, but after having voted by absentee ballot, the registrar must cancel that voter’s registration, and the absentee ballot should not be counted; but when absentee ballots
                    are cast prior to election day in a manner by which the absentee ballot no longer can be set aside, the general registrar who knows of the voter’s death shall cancel that voter’s registration, but election officials are not otherwise
                    required to perform the impossible task of not counting the deceased voter’s absentee ballot. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Robin R. Lind, Secretary, Goochland County Electoral Board, 10-104, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 71 (10/26/10).

                        Under former § 24.1-234 it is the imperative duty of the officers of election to count the votes of legal voters. They have no discretion except to deposit the ballots as directed and to count them. And the fact that the ballots were not counted and certified
                        on the night of election, when they ought to have been counted, does not mean that the officers cannot be compelled thereafter to count them. Moore v. Pullem,

                        When a general registrar knows that an absentee voter has died prior to election day, but after having voted by absentee ballot, the registrar must cancel that voter’s registration, and the absentee ballot should not be counted; but when absentee ballots
                        are cast prior to election day in a manner by which the absentee ballot no longer can be set aside, the general registrar who knows of the voter’s death shall cancel that voter’s registration, but election officials are not otherwise
                        required to perform the impossible task of not counting the deceased voter’s absentee ballot. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Robin R. Lind, Secretary, Goochland County Electoral Board, 10-104, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 71 (10/26/10).

                    Losing candidate was not entitled to reconsideration of a recount hearing because the court received a written statement from a recount official challenging the disposition of a ballot, the only procedural consideration was that the parties be allowed
                    to inspect the questioned ballots and the court hear argument prior to its certification, the failure to submit a written statement at a certain time did waive the recount official’s right to act, the questioned ballot included filled-in
                    ovals for both candidates, and, since the line drawn through the losing candidate’s oval corresponded to the definition of a scratch, the ballot was counted as a vote for the other (winning) candidate. Simonds v. Yancey, 98 Va. Cir.

                    court and two circuit court judges of circuits remote from the county or city that such candidate listed as his residency on his certificate of candidate qualification, appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia,
                    or, in the event of his inability to act, then by the next senior justice, who shall at the time of appointment set the date for trial.

                    If the chief judge of the circuit court of the city or county that the candidate listed as his residency on his certificate of candidate qualification is absent, unable to sit in the proceeding, or recuses himself, the clerk of the court shall at once
                    certify that fact to the Chief Justice. Then the Chief Justice or the associate justice acting in his stead shall appoint a third judge, who shall be, if possible, a judge of the same or an adjoining circuit.

                    Session of the General Assembly. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated these amendments into the new chapters where appropriate. The historical citations of former sections have been added to corresponding new
                    sections. For table of corresponding sections, see the table in Volume 10. Furthermore, relevant annotations under former sections have been set out under the appropriate new sections.

                <p>
                    If a “lobbyist relationship” as defined by § 30-111 arises in the context of an election campaign, the separate disclosure requirement of § 30-111 for members and members-elect of the General Assembly applies irrespective of any disclosure the Campaign
                    Finance Disclosure Act of 2006 may require of the campaign committee for the member or member-elect. A “lobbyist relationship” is not established when a person who has registered as a lobbyist provides volunteer assistance to the election
                    campaign of a member or member-elect if the nature of that assistance is not within the scope of the lobbyist’s usual occupation in legal, consulting or public relations services. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable William
                    M. Stanley, Member, Senate of Virginia, 13-108, (12/27/13).

                        Commonwealth’s evidence on the issue of defendant’s intent to make a false statement on his voter registration application was insufficient to support a logical inference that his applications indicated a willful intent to defraud or to relay erroneous
                        information; that possibility existed that defendant could have attempted to correct an improper statement in his first application by filing a second. Waller v. Commonwealth, 2002

                        of former Chapter 10 of Title 24.1, the witness is entitled to invoke the benefit of former § 24.1-281, which shields him from prosecution. The inquiry before the grand jury is a “proceeding” within the meaning of former § 24.1-281.
