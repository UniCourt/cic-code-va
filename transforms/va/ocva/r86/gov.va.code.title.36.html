                        There is nothing in the Virginia Constitution which limits or restricts the power to create a state agency, such as a housing authority, and designate it as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. Mumpower v. Housing Auth.,

                        In its reference to “governmental functions,” the General Assembly intended to declare that the activities of housing authorities are proper functions of government, thereby emphasizing the public purposes of such authorities and reinforcing the justification
                        for the expenditure of public funds for those purposes. VEPCO v. Hampton Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., <cite class="va_code">217 Va. 30</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 364, 1976 Va. LEXIS 237 (1976).

                        authority intended to use it for low income housing, did not establish the type of factual scenario necessary for equating the authority’s right to repurchase with an equitable servitude. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Hous.

    Creation of redevelopment and housing authorities.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    In each locality there is hereby created a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, with such public and corporate powers as are set forth in this chapter, to be known respectively as the “ . . . . . . . . (insert name of locality) Redevelopment and
                    Housing Authority” (hereinafter referred to as “authority”); provided, however, that any authority not now activated shall not transact any business or exercise any powers authorized under this chapter until or unless the qualified
                    voters of such locality shall by a majority vote of such qualified voters voting in a referendum held as provided in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c01a01s36-4.1" target="_self">36-4.1</a></cite>, have indicated
                    a need for an authority to function in such locality. The referendum to determine whether or not there is a need for an authority to function (i) may be called by the governing body by resolution or (ii) shall be called by the governing
                    body upon the filing of a petition signed by at least two percent of the qualified voters registered in the jurisdiction, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such locality and requesting the governing body
                    to call such referendum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The governing body may by resolution call for a referendum to determine whether there is need for an authority in the locality if the governing body believes it is appropriate for one of the reasons set out in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c01a01s36-2" target="_self">36-2. </a></cite>In
                    the case of a town located within the county, the town council shall first obtain the concurrence of the governing body of the county and the county redevelopment and housing authority prior to scheduling a referendum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers
                    hereunder if the voters of the locality have so indicated in a referendum held pursuant to § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c01a01s36-4.1" target="_self">36-4.1</a></cite>, that there is need for the authority.

        Redevelopment plan may contain anticompetitive measures. —

                    <p>
                        The state legislature expressly stated that the problems of urban blight required governmental action. Thus, the state concluded that private enterprise alone could not solve the problem. Accordingly, the state gave housing and redevelopment authorities
                        and cities vast powers to acquire land, clear it, determine appropriate land use for different parcels, impose conditions and limitations under which property may be redeveloped by public or private enterprise, and generally plan
                        the redevelopment of an entire area. Clearly the legislature contemplated that the redevelopment plan would contain anticompetitive measures similar to the challenged “blackout” agreement. The legislature must have contemplated
                        that the city would try to encourage private developers to invest heavily in redevelopment and that as part of that encouragement the city would agree not to aid in building competing structures. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606
                        F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

                    <p>
                        In order to induce the private investor to construct a much larger building than is presently required, the city would reasonably be expected to promise some limited form of protection from competition in the first few years after construction of the
                        building. Thus, the challenged “blackout” agreement and the city’s alleged refusal to cooperate with the plaintiffs is a form of limited protection from competition that the legislature must have contemplated when it authorized
                        the city to become involved in redevelopment projects. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606 F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

                <p>
                    When the need for an authority to be activated in a city or county has been determined in the manner prescribed by law, the governing body of the city or county shall appoint not more than nine or less than five persons as commissioners of the authority
                    created for such city or county. The governing body of the city or county may subsequently increase the number of commissioners of the authority to a maximum of nine. The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to
                    serve for terms of one, two, three, four and five years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, but thereafter commissioners shall be appointed as aforesaid for a term of office of four years except that all vacancies shall
                    be filled for the unexpired term. Notwithstanding any special or general law to the contrary, after July 1, 2017, no member of the Chesapeake Redevelopment and Housing Authority shall serve more than two consecutive terms. Any person
                    who has served more than one and one-half terms as a member of the Chesapeake Redevelopment and Housing Authority as of July 1, 2017, shall not be eligible for reappointment for another consecutive term. A member of the Chesapeake
                    Redevelopment and Housing Authority shall serve at the pleasure of the city council of the City of Chesapeake. No Chesapeake Redevelopment and Housing Authority member shall work for the Authority within one year after serving as a
                    member. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided in the charter of a city or town specifically pertaining to such authority, no commissioner of any authority may be an officer or employee, of the city or county for which the authority
                    is created. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and such certificate shall be
                    conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. A commissioner may receive compensation as may be determined by a locality for each meeting of the authority attended by the commissioner. A commissioner shall
                    be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any exercise of the powers of an authority by its commissioners after June 30, 1968, otherwise in compliance with applicable law, is hereby declared to be valid and effective in all respects, notwithstanding that the number of commissioners exercising
                    the powers, though not exceeding seven from July 1, 1968, through June 30, 1978, and not exceeding nine thereafter, may have exceeded the number appointed at the time the need for the authority to be activated had been determined in
                    accordance with this section. No suit or action to vacate or set aside any exercise of said powers may be brought on the ground that the number of commissioners, though not exceeding seven from July 1, 1968, through June 30, 1978,
                    and not exceeding nine thereafter, did exceed the number appointed at the time the need for the authority to be activated had been determined.

                        As the party challenging the findings of fact of a housing authority, the limited liability company carried the burden of proving its claims by clear and convincing evidence and it did not carry that burden; the law put the decision of whether an area
                        qualified for redevelopment in the hands of the redevelopment and housing authority, not the City and given its ultimate financial stake in supporting any redevelopment project, the City had a proper role in discussions and meetings
                        about the project as the evaluation process was underway, accordingly its participation in the process alone did not taint the plan. Evidence existed that, if believed, justified a finding that the majority of the properties that
                        were ultimately included in the plan area actually suffered from blight and this condition drove and shaped the parameters of the plan; there was not clear and convincing proof that the facts found by the authority were invalid

                        a newspaper published in such municipality, or if there is no newspaper published in such municipality, then in a newspaper published in the Commonwealth and having a general circulation in such municipality. Upon the date fixed

                        In an attack upon the organization of the housing authority of the City of Bristol, complainant contended that the purpose of the authority was not a public purpose and the taking of property by it was for a private use. It was held that, in view of the
                        purpose of the housing authority with reference to the eradication of slums and the providing of decent homes, the use of the property was a public one, and the fact that the project might primarily benefit only a class did not
                        take away the character of a public use. Mumpower v. Housing Auth., <cite class="va_code">176 Va. 426</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 732, 1940 Va. LEXIS 265 (1940).

                        “public announcement”; there can be no “public announcement” until there is a “project”; and there can be no “project” until the local governing body approves a “redevelopment plan,” a document which cannot be formulated without
                        time-consuming, extensive, detailed study. Thus, in the chronology of the urban renewal process, the General Assembly has implicitly selected the time when the governing body approves the concept as the date before which the authority
                        may not be charged with a delay which will invoke the principle of condemnation blight; this is when “public announcement by the condemnor” is deemed to have taken place. Pearsall v. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth.,

                    If a regional housing authority consists of only two counties, the boards of supervisors may agree to appoint two members each as commissioners of such authority. However, if the regional housing authority is changed to consist of three or more counties,

                    thereof shall be applicable to consolidated housing authorities and the commissioners thereof. The area of operation of a consolidated housing authority shall include all of the territory within the boundaries of each municipality
                    joining in the creation of the authority, except that the area of operation may be changed to include or exclude any municipality or municipalities in the same manner and under the same provisions as provided in this chapter for changing
                    the area of operation of a regional housing authority by including or excluding a county or counties. For all such purposes, the term “board of supervisors” shall be construed as meaning “governing body.” The term “county” shall be
                    construed as meaning “municipality” and the terms “county housing authority” and “regional housing authority” shall be construed as meaning “housing authority of the city” and “consolidated housing authority,” respectively, unless
                    a different meaning clearly appears from the context.

                    The governing body of a municipality for which a housing authority has not been created shall not adopt the above resolution unless it first declares that there is a need for a consolidated housing authority to function in the municipality, which declaration
                    shall be made in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the declaration of the governing body of a city required by § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c01a01s36-4" target="_self">36-4 </a></cite>for
                    the purpose of authorizing a housing authority created for a city to transact business and exercise its powers.

                <p>
                    Except as otherwise provided herein, a consolidated housing authority and the commissioners thereof shall, within the area of operation of the consolidated housing authority, have the same functions, rights, powers, duties, privileges, immunities and
                    limitations as those provided for housing authorities created for cities, counties, or groups of counties and the commissioners of such housing authorities, in the same manner as though all the provisions of law applicable to housing
                    authorities created for cities, counties, or groups of counties were applicable to consolidated housing authorities.

                    The term “municipality” as used in this chapter shall mean any county, city or town in the Commonwealth.

                <p>
                    The term “residential buildings” as used in this chapter shall include, but not be limited to, any multi-family residential property in which no less than twenty percent of the units will be occupied by persons of low income and the remainder therein
                    by persons of moderate income, both as determined by the housing authority using the criteria set forth in the definition of “persons and families of low and moderate income” in § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c1.2s36-55.26" target="_self">36-55.26</a></cite>,

                        It is incumbent upon property owners to show by competent evidence that a redevelopment authority’s finding of blight was arbitrary and unwarranted. The property owners’ burden cannot be sustained by the “ordinary preponderance of the evidence.” Runnels

                    <p>
                        The state legislature expressly stated that the problems of urban blight required governmental action. Thus, the state concluded that private enterprise alone could not solve the problem. Accordingly, the state gave housing and redevelopment authorities
                        and cities vast powers to acquire land, clear it, determine appropriate land use for different parcels, impose conditions and limitations under which property may be redeveloped by public or private enterprise, and generally plan
                        the redevelopment of an entire area. Clearly the legislature contemplated that the redevelopment plan would contain anticompetitive measures similar to the challenged “blackout” agreement. The legislature must have contemplated
                        that the city would try to encourage private developers to invest heavily in redevelopment and that as part of that encouragement the city would agree not to aid in building competing structures. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606
                        F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

                    <p>
                        In order to induce the private investor to construct a much larger building than is presently required, the city would reasonably be expected to promise some limited form of protection from competition in the first few years after construction of the
                        building. Thus, the challenged “blackout” agreement and the city’s alleged refusal to cooperate with the plaintiffs is a form of limited protection from competition that the legislature must have contemplated when it authorized
                        the city to become involved in redevelopment projects. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606 F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

        Redevelopment plan may contain anticompetitive measures. —

                    <p>
                        The state legislature expressly stated that the problems of urban blight required governmental action. Thus, the state concluded that private enterprise alone could not solve the problem. Accordingly, the state gave housing and redevelopment authorities
                        and cities vast powers to acquire land, clear it, determine appropriate land use for different parcels, impose conditions and limitations under which property may be redeveloped by public or private enterprise, and generally plan
                        the redevelopment of an entire area. Clearly the legislature contemplated that the redevelopment plan would contain anticompetitive measures similar to the challenged “blackout” agreement. The legislature must have contemplated
                        that the city would try to encourage private developers to invest heavily in redevelopment and that as part of that encouragement the city would agree not to aid in building competing structures. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606
                        F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

                    <p>
                        In order to induce the private investor to construct a much larger building than is presently required, the city would reasonably be expected to promise some limited form of protection from competition in the first few years after construction of the
                        building. Thus, the challenged “blackout” agreement and the city’s alleged refusal to cooperate with the plaintiffs is a form of limited protection from competition that the legislature must have contemplated when it authorized
                        the city to become involved in redevelopment projects. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606 F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984).

                        As the party challenging the findings of fact of a housing authority, the limited liability company carried the burden of proving its claims by clear and convincing evidence and it did not carry that burden; the law put the decision of whether an area
                        qualified for redevelopment in the hands of the redevelopment and housing authority, not the City and given its ultimate financial stake in supporting any redevelopment project, the City had a proper role in discussions and meetings
                        about the project as the evaluation process was underway, accordingly its participation in the process alone did not taint the plan. Evidence existed that, if believed, justified a finding that the majority of the properties that
                        were ultimately included in the plan area actually suffered from blight and this condition drove and shaped the parameters of the plan; there was not clear and convincing proof that the facts found by the authority were invalid
                        or that the plan’s adoption was arbitrary or capricious. City of Roanoke Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. B&amp;B Holdings, LLC, 79 Va. Cir. 495, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 123 (Roanoke Nov. 12, 2009).

                        of eminent domain only for the specific public purposes of eliminating deteriorating properties or arresting a blighting influence, and, if a property no longer met that criteria, acquisition by condemnation pursuant to a conservation
                        plan was no longer authorized so as to rebut the presumption of validity, the property owner bore the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the property no longer was a blight or no longer exerted a blighting influence

                        When a redevelopment authority’s conservation plan allowed it to acquire, without prior notice to correct a property’s blighted condition, properties that “appear infeasible of rehabilitation or their land use is inconsistent with the purposes and objectives
                        of the conservation plan,” this impermissibly gave the authority broader power than that conferred by clause (iv) of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c01a07s36-50.1" target="_self">36-50.1</a></cite>, which
                        allowed such acquisition without notice if properties “are infeasible of rehabilitation — so as to inhibit or prevent accomplishment of the purposes” of the plan, so this part of the plan could not be used as a basis for initiating

                <p>
                    It is hereby declared: (i) that there exists within the Commonwealth a serious shortage of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford; that this shortage has contributed
                    to and will contribute to the creation and persistence of substandard living conditions and is inimical to the health, welfare and prosperity of the residents of the Commonwealth; (ii) that it is imperative that the supply of residential
                    housing for such persons and families and for persons and families displaced by public actions or natural disaster be increased; (iii) that private enterprise and investment have been unable, without assistance, to produce the needed
                    construction or rehabilitation of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford and to provide sufficient long-term mortgage financing for residential housing
                    for occupancy by such persons and families; (iv) that a concentration of persons and families of low and moderate income even in standard structures does not eliminate undesirable social conditions; (v) that the governing body of a
                    city or county may in its discretion determine that it is necessary to the preservation of the financial viability of such city or county and the health, welfare and prosperity of its residents that the population of such city or county
                    be maintained as economically mixed by providing housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income in order to broaden the tax bases of such areas; (vi) that in providing sanitary and safe residential housing at
                    prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford it may at times be necessary or desirable to provide housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income; (vii) that it is critical
                    to the success, prosperity and viability of areas being revitalized that financing be made available for nonhousing buildings that are incidental to residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other persons
                    and families in order to provide products and services to those living in residential housing or that are necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such areas or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development
                    of such areas; (viii) that the financing of residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other persons and families may be appropriate to promote the industrial, commercial or other economic development
                    of certain areas in a city or the county by inducing manufacturing, industrial, commercial, governmental, educational, entertainment, community development, healthcare or nonprofit enterprises or undertakings to locate or remain in
                    such area; and (ix) that private enterprise and investment be encouraged both to sponsor land development and build and rehabilitate residential housing for such persons and families of low and moderate income and to build housing
                    which will prevent the recurrence of slum conditions by housing persons of varied economic means in the same projects or area, and that private financing be supplemented by financing as provided in this chapter in order to help prevent
                    the creation and recurrence of substandard living conditions and to assist in their permanent elimination throughout Virginia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is further declared that in order to provide a fully adequate supply of sanitary and safe dwelling accommodations at rents, prices, or other costs which such persons or families can afford and to stabilize or recover an appropriate economic mix in
                    certain areas of the Commonwealth the legislature finds that it is necessary to create and establish a state housing development authority for the purpose of encouraging the investment of private capital and stimulating the construction
                    and rehabilitation of residential housing to meet the needs of such persons and families or to stabilize such areas through the use of public financing, to provide construction and mortgage loans and to make provision for the purchase
                    of mortgage loans and otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is hereby further declared to be necessary and in the public interest that such state housing development authority provide for predevelopment costs, temporary financing, land development expenses and residential housing construction or rehabilitation
                    by private sponsors for sale or rental to persons and families of low and moderate income and others; further, to provide mortgage financing for the purposes of supplying sanitary and safe dwelling accommodations at rents, prices or
                    other costs which such persons or families can afford or of stabilizing urban areas, including without limitation, long-term federally insured mortgages; further, in revitalization areas designated in or pursuant to §

                        families of low and moderate income in the Commonwealth; further, to acquire, develop and own multifamily residential housing for occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income; further, to provide technical, consultative
                        and project assistance services to private sponsors; further, to assist in coordinating federal, state, regional and local public and private efforts and resources; to guarantee to the extent provided herein the repayment of certain
                        loans secured by residential mortgages; further, to promote wise usage of land and other resources in order to preserve the quality of life we value so highly in Virginia; and further, to act as the loan servicer for a housing
                        lender.

                <p>
                    It is hereby further declared that all of the foregoing are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted, and that such activities serve a public purpose in improving or otherwise benefiting
                    the people of the Commonwealth; that the necessity of enacting the provisions hereinafter set forth is in the public interest and is hereby so declared as a matter of express legislative determination.

                                For the purpose of this section, the terms “distribution” and “return” are intended to mean payments on account of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan resulting
                                from the operation thereof. Any payment to a person or entity who is a partner, principal, stockholder or holder of a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing sponsor shall not be deemed a “distribution” or “return”
                                to such person or entity if the funds with which such payment is made are funds paid or contributed to such limited profit housing sponsor by persons or entities purchasing a beneficial interest in such limited profit housing
                                sponsor. At or after the completion of construction, rehabilitation or improvement of the housing development or multifamily residential housing financed by such HDA mortgage loan, such limited profit housing sponsor’s
                                equity in the housing development or multifamily residential housing shall be established in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or commitment for such mortgage
                                loan. Such equity shall be determined by HDA, at its option, as either (i) the difference between the total housing development costs as to the housing development or multifamily residential housing and the final principal
                                amount of such HDA mortgage loan, or (ii) the difference between the fair market value of such housing development and the final principal amount of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may thereafter from time to time adjust such
                                equity to be equal to the difference, as of the date of adjustment, between the fair market value of such housing development and the outstanding principal balance of such HDA mortgage loan. HDA may review and regulate
                                a proposed retirement of any capital investment in, or redemption of any stock of, such limited profit housing sponsor in the manner provided by HDA in its rules and regulations or in the HDA resolution authorizing, or
                                commitment for, such mortgage loan.

                    rating service which could result in a rating for the bonds which would be in nonconformance with the rating covenants of the related bond indenture; and (ii) the executive director of HDA executes an affidavit stating that HDA was
                    unable, after diligent effort, to procure replacement mortgage guaranty insurance in a form and premium acceptable to HDA from another insurer licensed in this Commonwealth to transact mortgage guaranty insurance business. For purposes
                    of this section, “diligent effort” means a good faith search by HDA for mortgage guaranty insurance among admitted insurers resulting in declinations of coverage, by three unaffiliated insurers licensed and authorized in this Commonwealth
                    to write the mortgage guaranty insurance coverage sought, at a premium equal to or less than the premium in force for the loans made or financed by HDA. HDA may provide financing and other funding to any such fund or corporation and
                    may exercise all necessary or convenient rights and powers and perform all requisite duties and obligations relating thereto. Any such fund or corporation shall be subject to the direction and control of the commissioners of HDA and
                    shall have such powers and duties as the commissioners of HDA shall prescribe. Any such fund or corporation may charge such premiums and may establish such reserves as HDA shall specify. HDA may specify that any such reserves shall
                    be assets of such fund or corporation and shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of HDA. Any such fund or corporation, its directors, officers and employees, its assets and operations, and its policies of insurance and the
                    premiums therefor shall not be subject to the provisions of Title 38.2 and rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto. The property of any such fund or corporation and its income and operations shall be exempt from taxation or assessments
                    of every kind by the Commonwealth and all municipalities and other political subdivisions thereof. The provisions of § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c1.2s36-55.36" target="_self">36-55.36 </a></cite>shall not

                        Four critical factors are used to determine whether a veto violates the federal Fair Housing Act: (1) how strong is the plaintiff’s showing of discriminatory effect; (2) is there some evidence of discriminatory intent, though possibly not enough to satisfy
                        the constitutional standard of Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 Ct. 2040, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1976); (3) what is the defendant’s interest in taking the action complained of; and (4) does the plaintiff seek to compel the defendant
                        affirmatively to provide housing for members of minority groups or merely to restrain the defendant from interfering with individual property owners who wish to provide such housing. Atkins v. Robinson, 545 F. Supp. 852, 1982 U.S.

                        Two types of discriminatory effects can be produced by a facially neutral housing decision. First, the decision may have a greater adverse impact on one racial group than on another. Second, the decision may have a pejorative effect on the community involved
                        by perpetuating existing patterns of segregation and preventing interracial association. Atkins v. Robinson, 545 F. Supp. 852, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13912 (E.D. Va. 1982), aff'd, 733 F.2d 318, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 23022 (4th Cir.

                        Where the impact of any denial of housing opportunity in a county on the black residents of the county was obviously disproportionate, there were indirect racial references by two of the supervisors who opposed the project, there was a patent incongruity
                        between the veto and the board of supervisors’ prior recognition both of the need for housing assistance in the county, which need was concentrated in the county’s black population, and the veto was inconsistent with the county’s
                        professed desire to take steps to serve housing needs and improve the housing conditions of its residents, race was a compelling consideration in the board’s deliberations on the proposed development and its veto rested at least
                        in part on a racially discriminatory intent. Atkins v. Robinson, 545 F. Supp. 852, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13912 (E.D. Va. 1982), aff'd, 733 F.2d 318, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 23022 (4th Cir. 1984).

                    Industrialized building units and mobile homes, because of the manner of their construction, assembly, and use and that of their systems, components, and appliances, including heating, plumbing, and electrical systems, like other finished products having
                    concealed vital parts, may present hazards to the health, life, and safety of persons and to the safety of property unless properly designed and manufactured. In the sale or rental of industrialized building units and mobile homes,
                    there is also the possibility of defects not readily ascertainable when inspected by purchasers or users or by the local building official. It is the policy and purpose of the Commonwealth to provide protection to the public against
                    those possible hazards and to promote sound building construction, and for that purpose to forbid the sale, rental, or use of new industrialized building units and mobile homes that are not so constructed as to provide reasonable safety
                    and protection to their owners and users and involve reasonably sound building practices. It is further the policy of the Commonwealth to minimize the unique problems presented by a lack of uniform standards and inspection procedures
                    affecting the mass production of housing and to hereby declare its intention to (i) encourage the reduction of construction costs and (ii) make housing more feasible for all residents of the Commonwealth.

                        set forth in § 36-85.20 as grounds for refusal of a license, and information relating to other pertinent matters consistent with safeguarding the public interest. All such information shall be considered by the Board in determining

                        this chapter shall obtain a renewal of a license for the ensuing year, by application, accompanied by the required fee. Upon failure to renew, the license shall automatically expire. Such license may be renewed upon payment of

                        eligible for a license under the provisions of this chapter.Special licenses, not to exceed ten days in duration, may be issued for each temporary place of business, operated or proposed by the regulant, that is not contiguous
                        to other premises for which a license is issued. The fee for a special license shall be established by the Board, provided that no such license shall be required for a place of business operated by a regulant that is used exclusively
                        for storage.

                    Whenever a claim for a warranty service or about a defect is made to a regulant, it shall be handled as provided by this chapter. A record shall be made of the name and address of each claimant and the date, substance, and disposition of each claim about
                    a defect. The regulant may request that a claim be made in writing, but nevertheless shall record it as provided above, and may not delay service pending receipt of the written claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the regulant notified is not the responsible party, he shall, in writing, immediately notify the claimant of that fact, and shall also, in writing, immediately notify the responsible party of the claim. When a responsible party is asked to remedy
                    defects, such party may not fail to remedy those defects because another responsible party may also be responsible. Nothing herein shall prevent a responsible party from obtaining compensation by way of contribution or subrogation
                    from another responsible party in accordance with any other provision of law or contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the time limits provided in this chapter, the regulant shall either resolve the claim or determine that it is not justified. At any time a regulant determines that a claim for service is not justified in whole or part, he shall immediately notify
                    the claimant in writing that the claim or part of the claim is rejected and why, and shall inform the claimant that he is entitled to complain to the Board. The complete mailing address of the Board shall be provided in the notice.
                    Within five working days of receipt of a complaint, the Board shall send a complete copy thereof to the Director.

                    When a service agreement exists between or among a manufacturer, dealer, and supplier to provide warranty service, the agreement shall specify which such responsible party is to remedy warranty defects. Every such service agreement shall be in writing.
                    Nothing contained in such an agreement shall relieve the responsible party, as provided in this chapter, of responsibility to perform warranty service. However, any responsible party undertaking such an agreement to perform the warranty
                    service obligations of another shall thereby become responsible both to that other responsible party and to the buyer for his failure to adequately perform as agreed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When no service agreement exists for warranty service, the responsible party as designated by the provisions of this chapter is responsible for remedying the warranty defects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A defect shall be remedied within forty-five days of receipt of the written notification of the warranty claim, unless the claim is unreasonable or a bona fide reason exists for not remedying the defect within the forty-five-day period. The responsible
                    party shall respond to the claimant in writing with a copy to the Board stating what further action is contemplated by the responsible party. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, defects which constitute an imminent
                    safety hazard to life and health shall be remedied within three days of receipt of the written notification of the warranty claim. An imminent safety hazard to life and health shall include but not be limited to (i) inadequate heating
                    in freezing weather; (ii) failure of sanitary facilities; (iii) electrical shock or leaking gas; or (iv) major structural failure. The Board may suspend this three-day time period in the event of widespread defects or damage resulting
                    from adverse weather conditions or other natural catastrophes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the person remedying the defect is not the responsible party as designated by the provisions of this chapter, he shall be entitled to reasonable compensation paid to him by the responsible party. Conduct which coerces or requires a nonresponsible
                    party to perform warranty service is a violation of this chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Warranty service shall be performed at the site at which the manufactured home is initially delivered to the buyer, except for components which can be removed for service without undue inconvenience to the buyer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any responsible party shall have the right to complain to the Board when warranty service obligations under this chapter are not being enforced.

                    Any person who suffers any loss or damage by any act of a regulant that constitutes a violation of this chapter shall have the right to institute an action to recover from the recovery fund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon a finding by the Board that a violation has occurred, the Board shall direct the responsible manufacturer, dealer, broker, or salesperson to pay the awarded amount to the claimant. If such amount is not paid within thirty days following receipt of
                    the written decision of the Board and no appeal has been filed in court, the Board shall, upon request of the claimant, pay from the recovery fund the amount of the award to the claimant provided that:

                    against the fund, and the Board has reason to believe there may be additional claims against the fund from other transactions involving the same regulant, the Board may withhold any payments from the fund involving such regulant for
                    a period of not more than one year from the date on which the claimant is approved by the Board for an award from the fund. After this one-year period, if the aggregate of claims against the regulant exceeds the above limitations,
                    said amount shall be prorated by the Board among the claimants and paid from the fund in proportion to the amounts of their awards remaining unpaid.

                <p>
                    The amount of damages awarded by the Board shall be limited to actual, compensatory damages and shall not include attorney’s fees for representation before the Board.

                        42 U.S.C.S. § 3603(b)(1) because many victims of discrimination likely would not know or have any readily available way of determining whether a private individual landlord owned more than three single-family homes, but an individual
                        defendant would immediately know whether he or she fell within the exemption to the state and federal acts and could easily assert such a defense at a comparatively small cost; it strains logic and reason that exemptions to a statute

                <p>
                    For the purposes of this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Aggrieved person” means any person who (i) claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or (ii) believes that such person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Assistance animal” means an animal that works, provides assistance, or performs tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability, or provides emotional support that alleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of a person’s disability. Assistance
                    animals perform many disability-related functions, including guiding individuals who are blind or have low vision, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to sounds, providing protection or rescue assistance, pulling a
                    wheelchair, fetching items, alerting persons to impending seizures, or providing emotional support to persons with disabilities who have a disability-related need for such support. An assistance animal is not required to be individually
                    trained or certified. While dogs are the most common type of assistance animal, other animals can also be assistance animals. An assistance animal is not a pet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Complainant” means a person, including the Fair Housing Board, who files a complaint under § <cite class="ocva"><a href="#t36c5.1s36-96.9" target="_self">36-96.9.
  </a></cite>
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Conciliation” means the attempted resolution of issues raised by a complainant, or by the investigation of such complaint, through informal negotiations involving the aggrieved person, the respondent, their respective authorized representatives and the
                    Fair Housing Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Conciliation agreement” means a written agreement setting forth the resolution of the issues in conciliation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Disability” means, with respect to a person, (i) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of such person’s major life activities; (ii) a record of having such an impairment; or (iii) being regarded as having such an impairment.
                    The term does not include current, illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance as defined in Virginia or federal law. For the purposes of this chapter, the terms “disability” and “handicap” shall be interchangeable.

                        42 U.S.C.S. § 3603(b)(1) because many victims of discrimination likely would not know or have any readily available way of determining whether a private individual landlord owned more than three single-family homes, but an individual
                        defendant would immediately know whether he or she fell within the exemption to the state and federal acts and could easily assert such a defense at a comparatively small cost; it strains logic and reason that exemptions to a statute

                        Allegations in a complaint were sufficient to state causes of action against landlords and a real estate licensee for unlawful discrimination because the allegations were sufficient, as a matter of law, to show that the landlords’ motivation for requesting
                        additional rent from the tenants — and thus making the dwelling unavailable to the tenants and imposing the less favorable terms on the tenants — was based, at least in part, on the fact that the tenants had five children in their
                        family under the age of eighteen. Commonwealth ex rel. Real Estate Bd. v. Tutt Taylor &amp; Rankin Real Estate, LLC, 102 Va. Cir. 125, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 104 (Loudoun County May 9, 2019).

                        interest in renting the apartment and made multiple efforts to view the apartment, plaintiff was financially qualified to rent the apartment, defendant rejected plaintiff’s repeated attempts to view the apartment, and the apartment

       </b> could be interpreted as discriminating against families with children, in violation of the state and federal fair housing laws; if, however, the park eventually reaches the 80-percent senior occupancy rate requirement,
                        and it does not otherwise violate the state and federal fair housing laws based on familial status, it may become eligible to operate and advertise as housing for seniors. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable R. Steven

                        Circuit court erred in ruling that a condominium building’s claim for attorney’s fees was not barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. However, because the circuit court decided not to impose attorney’s fees or costs against the Commonwealth of Virginia,

                        Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award attorney’s fees to a condominium building because the court considered relevant factors and duly weighed them. Moreover, the condominium building failed to identify any improper factor or

                        In a housing discrimination action, the court found that this section was an exception to the general prohibition against the County Human Rights Commission (HRC) issuing subpoenas in such actions. The Fairfax County Fair Housing Ordinance did not run
                        contrary to Dillon’s Rule, and the HRC’s ability to issue subpoenas while investigating complaints of housing discrimination was fairly implied from the express powers granted by the General Assembly. Capital Inv. Advisors, LLC

                        Statutory and dictionary definitions of farm building were not binding but appropriate sources for consideration in determining the proper meaning of farm building in the context of the easement; with the incorporation of production, preparation, and
                        marketing as components of agricultural activities, the dictionary definitions are consistent with the statutory definition, which supported the inclusion of these components in the construction of the term farm building in the
                        easement, and the business’s intended use for its new building fell within the range of activities qualifying as a farm building under the easement. Wetlands Am. Trust, Inc. v. White Cloud Nine Ventures, L.P.,

                        Easement did not define the term farm building and did not incorporate the definition provided under the statute, but this definition illustrated that the term might have a more expansive definition from that offered by the organization; given the dictionary
                        definitions of farm and manufacture suggested that processing of component farm products into a finished product was a concept encompassed within the term farming. Wetlands Am. Trust, Inc. v. White Cloud Nine Ventures, L.P., 88

                        One of the important purposes of the Building Code is to provide for the safety of ultimate construction. Another important purpose is to enhance the safety of those working on the project and, indeed, the safety of the project itself. The dominant purpose,
                        therefore, is to provide comprehensive protection of the public health and safety. VEPCO v. Savoy Constr. Co., <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 36</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 811, 1982 Va. LEXIS 269 (1982).

                        Although a penal statute must be strictly construed and violation of the Building Code may result in criminal sanctions, the Building Code must be construed broadly enough to give substantial effect to the manifest legislative purpose of enhancing the
                        safety of project and those working on it, without disregarding its penal effects. VEPCO v. Savoy Constr. Co., <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 36</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 811, 1982 Va. LEXIS 269 (1982).

                        There must be compliance with the Building Code not only when work is performed but also when work required by the Building Code should be done to safeguard persons and property. Compliance only upon completion of the entire project in many instances
                        may be sufficient, but earlier compliance is necessary where danger may arise from delay in the performance of required work. VEPCO v. Savoy Constr. Co., <cite class="va_code">224 Va. 36</cite>, 294 S.E.2d

                        Circuit court did not err in affirming the State Building Code Technical Review Board’s interpretation of the Virginia Maintenance Code (VMC) because Review Board could fairly conclude the VMC required rental property owners to maintain an operable heating
                        facility since without the ability to provide adequate heat to the building’s residents, the property met the definition of unfit for human occupancy and that the VMC required electrical equipment be maintained in working condition.

                        facility since without the ability to provide adequate heat to the building’s residents, the property met the definition of unfit for human occupancy and that the VMC required electrical equipment be maintained in working condition.

                    Manufactured homes installed or relocated pursuant to the Building Code shall have skirting installed within sixty days of occupancy of the home. Skirting materials shall be durable, suitable for exterior exposures, and installed in accordance with the
                    manufacturer’s installation instructions. Skirting shall be secured as necessary to ensure stability, to minimize vibrations, to minimize susceptibility to wind damage, and to compensate for possible frost heave. Each manufactured
                    home shall have a minimum of one opening in the skirting providing access to any water supply or sewer drain connections under the home. Such openings shall be a minimum of eighteen inches in any dimension and not less than three square
                    feet in area. The access panel or door shall not be fastened in a manner requiring the use of a special tool to open or remove the panel or door. On-site fabrication of the skirting by the owner or installer of the home shall be acceptable,
                    provided that the material meets the requirements of the Building Code.

                        Circuit court did not err in affirming the State Building Code Technical Review Board’s interpretation of the Virginia Maintenance Code (VMC) because Review Board could fairly conclude the VMC required rental property owners to maintain an operable heating
                        facility since without the ability to provide adequate heat to the building’s residents, the property met the definition of unfit for human occupancy and that the VMC required electrical equipment be maintained in working condition.

                    <p>
                        Given this unique statutory scheme that effectively assimilates the actions of a locality and those of a state administrative agency and provides appellate review through the mechanism of the Virginia Administrative Process Act, the court of appeals has
                        subject matter jurisdiction to resolve assignments of error relating to the initiation and enforcement of the decisions of the State Building Code Technical Review Board by localities. Gaines v. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev.,

                    <p>
                        Circuit court correctly concluded the initial citation of property and a city’s subsequent enforcement of the State Building Code Technical Review Board’s case decision was not error; because the interests and responsibilities of localities and the Review
                        Board are overlapping and complimentary in the Uniform Statewide Building Code, any distinction between a Review Board case decision and the initiation and enforcement of that decision by a locality is one without a jurisdictional
                        difference. Gaines v. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev., 71 Va. App. 385, 837 S.E.2d 54, 2020 <cite class="va_code">Va. App. LEXIS 9</cite> (2020).

                        Board of supervisors had authority to set qualifications standards for third-party inspectors under the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code because USBC § 109.3 (2000 Ed.) [current version at 13 VAC 5-63-60 B] authorized a locality to impose “any
                        limitation” it chose on the delegation of duties by its building official to the third-party inspectors. Bd. of Supervisors v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., 52 Va. App. 460, 663 S.E.2d 571, 2008

                        not be charged more frequently than once in any 10-day period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $4,000. Designation of
                        a particular Code violation for a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions, and except for any violation resulting in injury to persons, such designation shall preclude the prosecution of a
                        violation as a misdemeanor.Any person summoned or issued a ticket for a scheduled violation may make an appearance in person or in writing by mail to the department of finance or the treasurer of the locality prior to the date
                        fixed for trial in court. Any person so appearing may enter a waiver of trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense charged. Such persons shall be informed of their right to stand trial and that
                        a signature to an admission of liability will have the same force and effect as a judgment of court. As a condition of waiver of trial, admission of liability, and payment of a civil penalty, the violator and a representative of
                        the locality shall agree in writing to terms of abatement or remediation of the violation within six months after the date of payment of the civil penalty.If a person charged with a scheduled violation does not elect to enter a
                        waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violation authorized by this
                        section, it shall be the burden of the locality to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose.If the
                        violation concerns a residential unit, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court shall order the violator to abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation
                        in order to comply with the Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within six months of the date of the assessment
                        of the civil penalty.If the violation concerns a nonresidential building or structure, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court may order the violator to abate, or otherwise
                        remedy through hazard control, the violation in order to comply with the Code. Any such violator so ordered shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within the time specified by the court.

                        Statute provided that a violation of the Uniform State Building Code was a misdemeanor punishable by a fine up to a specified sum; thus, the town could not enforce its inconsistent ordinance providing that violators of the municipal code based on that
